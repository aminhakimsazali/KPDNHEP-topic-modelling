Guild says suppliers are profiting the most from the ceiling price for Covid-19 self-test kits, while pharmacies are forced to shoulder the cost alone.\n\nKUALA LUMPUR, Sept 3 \u2014 The Malaysian Community Pharmacy Guild (MCPG) today urged the government to mandate supplier credit notes or rebates to community pharmacies for Covid-19 test kit stocks purchased before the imposition of retail ceiling prices.\n\nMCPG president Lovy Beh said while the group welcomed the government\u2019s move to make Covid-19 self-test kits more affordable for ordinary Malaysians, it meant that community pharmacies have to bear the cost of self-test kits purchased at previous prices exceeding the new ceiling price of RM19.90.\n\n\u201cThis means that suppliers have been making hefty profits all these while, even as we succumbed to their requirements like bulk purchasing with various tier pricings, and cash terms in order to maintain a reasonable price for consumers \u2013 affecting our cash flow and stock management.\n\n\u201cThe government, meanwhile, has left us in the dark regarding this new ceiling price. We were not informed or consulted in any way, and are now given a short timeframe to implement it in three days\u2019 time from September 5, 2021,\u201d Beh said in a statement today.\n\nShe said similar issues came about when face mask ceiling prices were introduced last year when the Covid-19 outbreak first began, forcing community pharmacists to shoulder the cost alone, while they took hits to their reputation as professional health care providers.\n\n\u201cIn the future, if ceiling prices are to be introduced, it should be done so from day one and not halfway through. Now pharmacists are portrayed as the villains and the government the heroes, with suppliers profiting the most in this arrangement,\u201d Beh said.\n\nThe government announced yesterday a retail ceiling price of RM19.90 and wholesale ceiling price of RM16 for Covid-19 self-test kits that would come into effect on September 5. Pharmaceutical professional groups, including the Malaysian Pharmacists Society (MPS), however, claimed that the decision was made unilaterally.\n\nMPS president Amrahi Buang said while a meeting was held between industry stakeholders and Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) minister Alexander Nanta Linggi on August 18 to make self-test kits affordable, the actual ceiling price for self-test kits was not discussed.\n\nAmrahi said the self-test kit cost price is in the range of RM22 to RM32, which is way above the capped price of RM19.90. \u201cAs such, it would be best if KPDNHEP can subsidise the self-test kit costs for community pharmacies,\u201d he said. Amrahi also insisted that KPDNHEP call on suppliers to provide rebates for pharmacies.\n\nAlexander, in a separate statement today, denied MPS\u2019 claims that the decision to cap self-test kit prices was made hastily, saying that KPDNHEP planned for the price ceiling a month ahead of its implementation.\n\nHe said various consultation sessions were held with relevant industry stakeholders, government agencies such as the Ministry of Health and the Royal Customs Department, pharmaceutical associations, manufacturers, distributors, importers, and retailers to obtain accurate information on the supply and sale of the self-test kits.\n\n\u201cAlthough the content of the discussion did not touch specifically on the actual price control, all industry players involved should know that the purpose of the discussion was to obtain counsel on pricing and supply mechanisms,\u201d Alexander said.\n\n\u201cEvery detail and feedback from the engagement session is taken into account by KPDNHEP in implementing the maximum pricing decision provided under Section 4 of the Price Control and Anti-Profiteering Act 2011 (AKHAP 2011) as used for face masks and bottled pure palm cooking oil previously,\u201d Alexander added.\n\nHe said the implementation of the price control and its enforcement on Covid-19 antigen rapid test kit (self-test) in the local market was also approved and supported by the MOH through the Medical Devices Authority (MDA) for national interest to encourage self-monitoring by detecting and controlling the transmission of the Covid-19 disease by consumers.\n\n\u201cI would really appreciate it if MPS is more rational and realistic with the current situation where the self-testing equipment is a sensitive item in terms of pricing and supply to the people during this pandemic.\u201d", "keyword": ["pharmacists", "kits", "ceiling", "kit", "rebates", "supplier", "prices", "price", "mandated", "community", "test", "kpdnhep", "current", "stock",

in the Greater Klang Valley Special Task Force (GKVSTF) that was launched in July to accelerate the Covid-19 vaccination rollout under Operation Surge Capacity in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur needed to

they will receive, but we\u2019ve also started to transfer some workforces and medical assets from other states that require less of them, to these states.\n\n\u201cThis is part of a holistic effort to ensure that we can reduce the number of people in Malaysia that need to be hospitalised, have severe symptoms, and die due to the coronavirus,\u201d Khairy told a media briefing in Putrajaya

(1.9 million doses), Kedah (1.3 million doses), Kelantan (1.2 million doses), and Penang (1 million doses).\n\nApart from a ramped-up vaccination programme, Khairy said the surge capacity operations will also see increased Covid-19 testing and priority in these states, given their high positive rates and relatively low vaccine coverage.\n\n\u201cBe that as it may, it doesn\u2019t mean that we will reduce testing in other states because most states are still recording positive rates of more than 10 per cent.

Guild says suppliers are profiting the most from the ceiling price for Covid-19 self-test kits, while pharmacies are forced to shoulder the cost alone.\n\nKUALA LUMPUR, Sept 3 \u2014 The Malaysian Community Pharmacy Guild (MCPG) today urged the government to mandate supplier credit notes or rebates to community pharmacies for Covid-19 test kit stocks purchased before the imposition of retail ceiling prices.\n\nMCPG president Lovy Beh said while the group welcomed the government\u2019s move to make Covid-19 self-test kits more affordable for ordinary Malaysians, it meant that community pharmacies have to bear the cost of self-test kits purchased at previous prices exceeding the new ceiling price of RM19.90.\n\n\u201cThis means that suppliers have been making hefty profits all these while, even as we succumbed to their requirements like bulk purchasing with various tier pricings, and cash terms in order to maintain a reasonable price for consumers \u2013 affecting our cash flow and stock management.\n\n\u201cThe government, meanwhile, has left us in the dark regarding this new ceiling price. We were not informed or consulted in any way, and are now given a short timeframe to implement it in three days\u2019 time from September 5, 2021,\u201d Beh said in a statement today.\n\nShe said similar issues came about when face mask ceiling prices were introduced last year when the Covid-19 outbreak first began, forcing community pharmacists to shoulder the cost alone, while they took hits to their reputation as professional health care providers.\n\n\u201cIn the future, if ceiling prices are to be introduced, it should be done so from day one and not halfway through. Now pharmacists are portrayed as the villains and the government the heroes, with suppliers profiting the most in this arrangement,\u201d Beh said.\n\nThe government announced yesterday a retail ceiling price of RM19.90 and wholesale ceiling price of RM16 for Covid-19 self-test kits that would come into effect on September 5. Pharmaceutical professional groups, including the Malaysian Pharmacists Society (MPS), however, claimed that the decision was made unilaterally.\n\nMPS president Amrahi Buang said while a meeting was held between industry stakeholders and Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) minister Alexander Nanta Linggi on August 18 to make self-test kits affordable, the actual ceiling price for self-test kits was not discussed.\n\nAmrahi said the self-test kit cost price is in the range of RM22 to RM32, which is way above the capped price of RM19.90. \u201cAs such, it would be best if KPDNHEP can subsidise the self-test kit costs for community pharmacies,\u201d he said. Amrahi also insisted that KPDNHEP call on suppliers to provide rebates for pharmacies.\n\nAlexander, in a separate statement today, denied MPS\u2019 claims that the decision to cap self-test kit prices was made hastily, saying that KPDNHEP planned for the price ceiling a month ahead of its implementation.\n\nHe said various consultation sessions were held with relevant industry stakeholders, government agencies such as the Ministry of Health and the Royal Customs Department, pharmaceutical associations, manufacturers, distributors, importers, and retailers to obtain accurate information on the supply and sale of the self-test kits.\n\n\u201cAlthough the content of the discussion did not touch specifically on the actual price control, all industry players involved should know that the purpose of the discussion was to obtain counsel on pricing and supply mechanisms,\u201d Alexander said.\n\n\u201cEvery detail and feedback from the engagement session is taken into account by KPDNHEP in implementing the maximum pricing decision provided under Section 4 of the Price Control and Anti-Profiteering Act 2011 (AKHAP 2011) as used for face masks and bottled pure palm cooking oil previously,\u201d Alexander added.\n\nHe said the implementation of the price control and its enforcement on Covid-19 antigen rapid test kit (self-test) in the local market was also approved and

Guild says suppliers are profiting the most from the ceiling price for Covid-19 self-test kits, while pharmacies are forced to shoulder the cost alone.\n\nKUALA LUMPUR, Sept 3 \u2014 The Malaysian Community Pharmacy Guild (MCPG) today urged the government to mandate supplier credit notes or rebates to community pharmacies for Covid-19 test kit stocks purchased before the imposition of retail ceiling prices.\n\nMCPG president Lovy Beh said while the group welcomed the government\u2019s move to make Covid-19 self-test kits more affordable for ordinary Malaysians, it meant that community pharmacies have to bear the cost of self-test kits purchased at previous prices exceeding the new ceiling price of RM19.90.\n\n\u201cThis means that suppliers have been making hefty profits all these while, even as we succumbed to their requirements like bulk purchasing with various tier pricings, and cash terms in order to maintain a reasonable price for consumers \u2013 affecting our cash flow and stock management.\n\n\u201cThe government, meanwhile, has left us in the dark regarding this new ceiling price. We were not informed or consulted in any way, and are now given a short timeframe to implement it in three days\u2019 time from September 5, 2021,\u201d Beh said in a statement today.\n\nShe said similar issues came about when face mask ceiling prices were introduced last year when the Covid-19 outbreak first began, forcing community pharmacists to shoulder the cost alone, while they took hits to their reputation as professional health care providers.\n\n\u201cIn the future, if ceiling prices are to be introduced, it should be done so from day one and not halfway through. Now pharmacists are portrayed as the villains and the government the heroes, with suppliers profiting the most in this arrangement,\u201d Beh said.\n\nThe government announced yesterday a retail ceiling price of RM19.90 and wholesale ceiling price of RM16 for Covid-19 self-test kits that would come into effect on September 5. Pharmaceutical professional groups, including the Malaysian Pharmacists Society (MPS), however, claimed that the decision was made unilaterally.\n\nMPS president Amrahi Buang said while a meeting was held between industry stakeholders and Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) minister Alexander Nanta Linggi on August 18 to make self-test kits affordable, the actual ceiling price for self-test kits was not discussed.\n\nAmrahi said the self-test kit cost price is in the range of RM22 to RM32, which is way above the capped price of RM19.90. \u201cAs such, it would be best if KPDNHEP can subsidise the self-test kit costs for community pharmacies,\u201d he said. Amrahi also insisted that KPDNHEP call on suppliers to provide rebates for pharmacies.\n\nAlexander, in a separate statement today, denied MPS\u2019 claims that the decision to cap self-test kit prices was made hastily, saying that KPDNHEP planned for the price ceiling a month ahead of its implementation.\n\nHe said various consultation sessions were held with relevant industry stakeholders, government agencies such as the Ministry of Health and the Royal Customs Department, pharmaceutical associations, manufacturers, distributors, importers, and retailers to obtain accurate information on the supply and sale of the self-test kits.\n\n\u201cAlthough the content of the discussion did not touch specifically on the actual price control, all industry players involved should know that the purpose of the discussion was to obtain counsel on pricing and supply mechanisms,\u201d Alexander said.\n\n\u201cEvery detail and feedback from the engagement session is taken into account by KPDNHEP in implementing the maximum pricing decision provided under Section 4 of the Price Control and Anti-Profiteering Act 2011 (AKHAP 2011) as used for face masks and bottled pure palm cooking oil previously,\u201d Alexander added.\n\nHe said the implementation of the price control and its enforcement on Covid-19 antigen rapid test kit (self-test) in the local market was also approved and supported by the MOH through the Medical Devices Authority (MDA) for national interest to encourage self-monitoring by detecting and controlling the transmission of the Covid-19 disease by consumers.\n\n\u201cI would really appreciate it if MPS is more rational and realistic with the current situation where the self-testing equipment is a sensitive item in terms of pricing and supply to the people during this pandemic.\u201d", "keyword": ["pharmacists", "kits", "ceiling", "kit", "rebates", "supplier", "prices", "price", "mandated", "community", "test", "kpdnhep", "current", "stock",

medical resources, and increase testing in Sabah, Johor, Kedah, Penang, and Kelantan to combat their surging epidemics.\n\nHealth Minister Khairy Jamaluddin today said that the sense of urgency seen in the Greater Klang Valley Special Task Force (GKVSTF) that was launched in July to accelerate the Covid-19 vaccination rollout under Operation Surge Capacity in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur needed to be emulated in the five states that have among the least percentage of vaccinated adults in the country.\n\n\u201cThese states will not only be prioritised in terms of the amount of Covid-19 vaccines they will receive, but we\u2019ve also started to transfer some workforces and medical assets from other states that require less of them, to these states.\n\n\u201cThis is part of a holistic effort to ensure that we can reduce the number of people in Malaysia that need to be hospitalised, have severe symptoms, and die due to the coronavirus,\u201d Khairy told a media briefing in Putrajaya today.\n\nKhairy said out of 15.16 million Covid-19 vaccine doses expected to be rolled out in September, more than half at 8.3 million will go to the five states: Sabah (2.9 million doses), Johor (1.9 million doses), Kedah (1.3 million doses), Kelantan (1.2 million doses), and Penang (1 million doses).\n\nApart from a ramped-up vaccination programme, Khairy said the surge capacity operations will also see increased Covid-19 testing and priority in these states, given their high positive rates and relatively low vaccine coverage.\n\n\u201cBe that as it may, it doesn\u2019t mean that we will reduce testing in other states because most states are still recording positive rates of more than 10 per cent. We have always emphasised on testing, but we also want to do testing in a targeted manner so that we make the best yield from the resources that are available,\u201d Khairy said.\n\nCodeBlue previously reported that Kuala Lumpur and most states reported positive rates exceeding 10 per cent in the past week from August 22 to 28, including Sabah, Kedah, Kelantan, and Perlis with rates above 20 per cent. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a maximum 5 per cent benchmark as an indicator of sufficient testing.\n\nHe said MOH is also working with the private sector to get companies to test their employees. \u201cThis is where if employers want to open up their businesses, they have to step forward to provide testing for their employees, especially for symptomatic, and those who are sick.\u201d\n\nKhairy said the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) will announce a price cap on self-test kits that are currently within the range of RM35 to RM40 apiece.\n\nCodeBlue previously reported worsening outbreaks in Penang, Johor, Kedah, Sabah, Kelantan, and Perak, as these six largely unvaccinated states registered record high infections and deaths, while the Klang Valley crisis in July consumed federal attention and vaccines.\n\nAs of August 31, Perak, Johor, Kelantan, Kedah, and Sabah have the country\u2019s lowest proportion of adults fully inoculated at below 48 per cent, compared to the national 64.2 per cent average.

Guild says suppliers are profiting the most from the ceiling price for Covid-19 self-test kits, while pharmacies are forced to shoulder the cost alone.\n\nKUALA LUMPUR, Sept 3 \u2014 The Malaysian Community Pharmacy Guild (MCPG) today urged the government to mandate supplier credit notes or rebates to community pharmacies for Covid-19 test kit stocks purchased before the imposition of retail ceiling prices.\n\nMCPG president Lovy Beh said while the group welcomed the government\u2019s move to make Covid-19 self-test kits more affordable for ordinary Malaysians, it meant that community pharmacies have to bear the cost of self-test kits purchased at previous prices exceeding the new ceiling price of RM19.90.\n\n\u201cThis means that suppliers have been making hefty profits all these while, even as we succumbed to their requirements like bulk purchasing with various tier pricings, and cash terms in order to maintain a reasonable price for consumers \u2013 affecting our cash flow and stock management.\n\n\u201cThe government, meanwhile, has left us in the dark regarding this new ceiling price. We were not informed or consulted in any way, and are now given a short timeframe to implement it in three days\u2019 time from September 5, 2021,\u201d Beh said in a statement today.\n\nShe said similar issues came about when face mask ceiling prices were introduced last year when the Covid-19 outbreak first began, forcing community pharmacists to shoulder the cost alone, while they took hits to their reputation as professional health care providers.\n\n\u201cIn the future, if ceiling prices are to be introduced, it should be done so from day one and not halfway through. Now pharmacists are portrayed as the villains and the government the heroes, with suppliers profiting the most in this arrangement,\u201d Beh said.\n\nThe government announced yesterday a retail ceiling price of RM19.90 and wholesale ceiling price of RM16 for Covid-19 self-test kits that would come into effect on September 5. Pharmaceutical professional groups, including the Malaysian Pharmacists Society (MPS), however, claimed that the decision was made unilaterally.\n\nMPS president Amrahi Buang said while a meeting was held between industry stakeholders and Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) minister Alexander Nanta Linggi on August 18 to make self-test kits affordable, the actual ceiling price for self-test kits was not discussed.\n\nAmrahi said the self-test kit cost price is in the range of RM22 to RM32, which is way above the capped price of RM19.90. \u201cAs such, it would be best if KPDNHEP can subsidise the self-test kit costs for community pharmacies,\u201d he said. Amrahi also insisted that KPDNHEP call on suppliers to provide rebates for pharmacies.\n\nAlexander, in a separate statement today, denied MPS\u2019 claims that the decision to cap self-test kit prices was made hastily, saying that KPDNHEP planned for the price ceiling a month ahead of its implementation.\n\nHe said various consultation sessions were held with relevant industry stakeholders, government agencies such as the Ministry of Health and the Royal Customs Department, pharmaceutical associations, manufacturers, distributors, importers, and retailers to obtain accurate information on the supply and sale of the self-test kits.\n\n\u201cAlthough the content of the discussion did not touch specifically on the actual price control, all industry players involved should know that the purpose of the discussion was to obtain counsel on pricing and supply mechanisms,\u201d Alexander said.\n\n\u201cEvery detail and feedback from the engagement session is taken into account by KPDNHEP in implementing the maximum pricing decision provided under Section 4 of the Price Control and Anti-Profiteering Act 2011 (AKHAP 2011) as used for face masks and bottled pure palm cooking oil previously,\u201d Alexander added.\n\nHe said the implementation of the price control and its enforcement on Covid-19 antigen rapid test kit (self-test) in the local market was also approved and supported by the MOH through the Medical Devices Authority (MDA) for national interest to encourage self-monitoring by detecting and controlling the transmission of the Covid-19 disease by consumers.\n\n\u201cI would really appreciate it if MPS is more rational and realistic with the current situation where the self-testing equipment is a sensitive item in terms of pricing and supply to the people during this pandemic.\u201d", "keyword": ["pharmacists", "kits", "ceiling", "kit", "rebates", "supplier", "prices", "price", "mandated", "community", "test", "kpdnhep", "current", "stock",

medical resources, and increase testing in Sabah, Johor, Kedah, Penang, and Kelantan to combat their surging epidemics.\n\nHealth Minister Khairy Jamaluddin today said that the sense of urgency seen in the Greater Klang Valley Special Task Force (GKVSTF) that was launched in July to accelerate the Covid-19 vaccination rollout under Operation Surge Capacity in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur needed to be emulated in the five states that have among the least percentage of vaccinated adults in the country.\n\n\u201cThese states will not only be prioritised in terms of the amount of Covid-19 vaccines they will receive, but we\u2019ve also started to transfer some workforces and medical assets from other states that require less of them, to these states.\n\n\u201cThis is part of a holistic effort to ensure that we can reduce the number of people in Malaysia that need to be hospitalised, have severe symptoms, and die due to the coronavirus,\u201d Khairy told a media briefing in Putrajaya today.\n\nKhairy said out of 15.16 million Covid-19 vaccine doses expected to be rolled out in September, more than half at 8.3 million will go to the five states: Sabah (2.9 million doses), Johor (1.9 million doses), Kedah (1.3 million doses), Kelantan (1.2 million doses), and Penang (1 million doses).\n\nApart from a ramped-up vaccination programme, Khairy said the surge capacity operations will also see increased Covid-19 testing and priority in these states, given their high positive rates and relatively low vaccine coverage.\n\n\u201cBe that as it may, it doesn\u2019t mean that we will reduce testing in other states because most states are still recording positive rates of more than 10 per cent. We have always emphasised on testing, but we also want to do testing in a targeted manner so that we make the best yield from the resources that are available,\u201d Khairy said.\n\nCodeBlue previously reported that Kuala Lumpur and most states reported positive rates exceeding 10 per cent in the past week from August 22 to 28, including Sabah, Kedah, Kelantan, and Perlis with rates above 20 per cent. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a maximum 5 per cent benchmark as an indicator of sufficient testing.\n\nHe said MOH is also working with the private sector to get companies to test their employees. \u201cThis is where if employers want to open up their businesses, they have to step forward to provide testing for their employees, especially for symptomatic, and those who are sick.\u201d\n\nKhairy said the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) will announce a price cap on self-test kits that are currently within the range of RM35 to RM40 apiece.\n\nCodeBlue previously reported worsening outbreaks in Penang, Johor, Kedah, Sabah, Kelantan, and Perak, as these six largely unvaccinated states registered record high infections and deaths, while the Klang Valley crisis in July consumed federal attention and vaccines.\n\nAs of August 31, Perak, Johor, Kelantan, Kedah, and Sabah have the country\u2019s lowest proportion of adults fully inoculated at below 48 per cent, compared to the national 64.2 per cent average.

Guild says suppliers are profiting the most from the ceiling price for Covid-19 self-test kits, while pharmacies are forced to shoulder the cost alone.\n\nKUALA LUMPUR, Sept 3 \u2014 The Malaysian Community Pharmacy Guild (MCPG) today urged the government to mandate supplier credit notes or rebates to community pharmacies for Covid-19 test kit stocks purchased before the imposition of retail ceiling prices.\n\nMCPG president Lovy Beh said while the group welcomed the government\u2019s move to make Covid-19 self-test kits more affordable for ordinary Malaysians, it meant that community pharmacies have to bear the cost of self-test kits purchased at previous prices exceeding the new ceiling price of RM19.90.\n\n\u201cThis means that suppliers have been making hefty profits all these while, even as we succumbed to their requirements like bulk purchasing with various tier pricings, and cash terms in order to maintain a reasonable price for consumers \u2013 affecting our cash flow and stock management.\n\n\u201cThe government, meanwhile, has left us in the dark regarding this new ceiling price. We were not informed or consulted in any way, and are now given a short timeframe to implement it in three days\u2019 time from September 5, 2021,\u201d Beh said in a statement today.\n\nShe said similar issues came about when face mask ceiling prices were introduced last year when the Covid-19 outbreak first began, forcing community pharmacists to shoulder the cost alone, while they took hits to their reputation as professional health care providers.\n\n\u201cIn the future, if ceiling prices are to be introduced, it should be done so from day one and not halfway through. Now pharmacists are portrayed as the villains and the government the heroes, with suppliers profiting the most in this arrangement,\u201d Beh said.\n\nThe government announced yesterday a retail ceiling price of RM19.90 and wholesale ceiling price of RM16 for Covid-19 self-test kits that would come into effect on September 5. Pharmaceutical professional groups, including the Malaysian Pharmacists Society (MPS), however, claimed that the decision was made unilaterally.\n\nMPS president Amrahi Buang said while a meeting was held between industry stakeholders and Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) minister Alexander Nanta Linggi on August 18 to make self-test kits affordable, the actual ceiling price for self-test kits was not discussed.\n\nAmrahi said the self-test kit cost price is in the range of RM22 to RM32, which is way above the capped price of RM19.90. \u201cAs such, it would be best if KPDNHEP can subsidise the self-test kit costs for community pharmacies,\u201d he said. Amrahi also insisted that KPDNHEP call on suppliers to provide rebates for pharmacies.\n\nAlexander, in a separate statement today, denied MPS\u2019 claims that the decision to cap self-test kit prices was made hastily, saying that KPDNHEP planned for the price ceiling a month ahead of its implementation.\n\nHe said various consultation sessions were held with relevant industry stakeholders, government agencies such as the Ministry of Health and the Royal Customs Department, pharmaceutical associations, manufacturers, distributors, importers, and retailers to obtain accurate information on the supply and sale of the self-test kits.\n\n\u201cAlthough the content of the discussion did not touch specifically on the actual price control, all industry players involved should know that the purpose of the discussion was to obtain counsel on pricing and supply mechanisms,\u201d Alexander said.\n\n\u201cEvery detail and feedback from the engagement session is taken into account by KPDNHEP in implementing the maximum pricing decision provided under Section 4 of the Price Control and Anti-Profiteering Act 2011 (AKHAP 2011) as used for face masks and bottled pure palm cooking oil previously,\u201d Alexander added.\n\nHe said the implementation of the price control and its enforcement on Covid-19 antigen rapid test kit (self-test) in the local market was also approved and supported by the MOH through the Medical Devices Authority (MDA) for national interest to encourage self-monitoring by detecting and controlling the transmission of the Covid-19 disease by consumers.\n\n\u201cI would really appreciate it if MPS is more rational and realistic with the current situation where the self-testing equipment is a sensitive item in terms of pricing and supply to the people during this pandemic.\u201d", "keyword": ["pharmacists", "kits", "ceiling", "kit", "rebates", "supplier", "prices", "price", "mandated", "community", "test", "kpdnhep", "current", "stock",

medical resources, and increase testing in Sabah, Johor, Kedah, Penang, and Kelantan to combat their surging epidemics.\n\nHealth Minister Khairy Jamaluddin today said that the sense of urgency seen in the Greater Klang Valley Special Task Force (GKVSTF) that was launched in July to accelerate the Covid-19 vaccination rollout under Operation Surge Capacity in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur needed to be emulated in the five states that have among the least percentage of vaccinated adults in the country.\n\n\u201cThese states will not only be prioritised in terms of the amount of Covid-19 vaccines they will receive, but we\u2019ve also started to transfer some workforces and medical assets from other states that require less of them, to these states.\n\n\u201cThis is part of a holistic effort to ensure that we can reduce the number of people in Malaysia that need to be hospitalised, have severe symptoms, and die due to the coronavirus,\u201d Khairy told a media briefing in Putrajaya today.\n\nKhairy said out of 15.16 million Covid-19 vaccine doses expected to be rolled out in September, more than half at 8.3 million will go to the five states: Sabah (2.9 million doses), Johor (1.9 million doses), Kedah (1.3 million doses), Kelantan (1.2 million doses), and Penang (1 million doses).\n\nApart from a ramped-up vaccination programme, Khairy said the surge capacity operations will also see increased Covid-19 testing and priority in these states, given their high positive rates and relatively low vaccine coverage.\n\n\u201cBe that as it may, it doesn\u2019t mean that we will reduce testing in other states because most states are still recording positive rates of more than 10 per cent. We have always emphasised on testing, but we also want to do testing in a targeted manner so that we make the best yield from the resources that are available,\u201d Khairy said.\n\nCodeBlue previously reported that Kuala Lumpur and most states reported positive rates exceeding 10 per cent in the past week from August 22 to 28, including Sabah, Kedah, Kelantan, and Perlis with rates above 20 per cent. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a maximum 5 per cent benchmark as an indicator of sufficient testing.\n\nHe said MOH is also working with the private sector to get companies to test their employees. \u201cThis is where if employers want to open up their businesses, they have to step forward to provide testing for their employees, especially for symptomatic, and those who are sick.\u201d\n\nKhairy said the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) will announce a price cap on self-test kits that are currently within the range of RM35 to RM40 apiece.\n\nCodeBlue previously reported worsening outbreaks in Penang, Johor, Kedah, Sabah, Kelantan, and Perak, as these six largely unvaccinated states registered record high infections and deaths, while the Klang Valley crisis in July consumed federal attention and vaccines.\n\nAs of August 31, Perak, Johor, Kelantan, Kedah, and Sabah have the country\u2019s lowest proportion of adults fully inoculated at below 48 per cent, compared to the national 64.2 per cent average.

Guild says suppliers are profiting the most from the ceiling price for Covid-19 self-test kits, while pharmacies are forced to shoulder the cost alone.\n\nKUALA LUMPUR, Sept 3 \u2014 The Malaysian Community Pharmacy Guild (MCPG) today urged the government to mandate supplier credit notes or rebates to community pharmacies for Covid-19 test kit stocks purchased before the imposition of retail ceiling prices.\n\nMCPG president Lovy Beh said while the group welcomed the government\u2019s move to make Covid-19 self-test kits more affordable for ordinary Malaysians, it meant that community pharmacies have to bear the cost of self-test kits purchased at previous prices exceeding the new ceiling price of RM19.90.\n\n\u201cThis means that suppliers have been making hefty profits all these while, even as we succumbed to their requirements like bulk purchasing with various tier pricings, and cash terms in order to maintain a reasonable price for consumers \u2013 affecting our cash flow and stock management.\n\n\u201cThe government, meanwhile, has left us in the dark regarding this new ceiling price. We were not informed or consulted in any way, and are now given a short timeframe to implement it in three days\u2019 time from September 5, 2021,\u201d Beh said in a statement today.\n\nShe said similar issues came about when face mask ceiling prices were introduced last year when the Covid-19 outbreak first began, forcing community pharmacists to shoulder the cost alone, while they took hits to their reputation as professional health care providers.\n\n\u201cIn the future, if ceiling prices are to be introduced, it should be done so from day one and not halfway through. Now pharmacists are portrayed as the villains and the government the heroes, with suppliers profiting the most in this arrangement,\u201d Beh said.\n\nThe government announced yesterday a retail ceiling price of RM19.90 and wholesale ceiling price of RM16 for Covid-19 self-test kits that would come into effect on September 5. Pharmaceutical professional groups, including the Malaysian Pharmacists Society (MPS), however, claimed that the decision was made unilaterally.\n\nMPS president Amrahi Buang said while a meeting was held between industry stakeholders and Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) minister Alexander Nanta Linggi on August 18 to make self-test kits affordable, the actual ceiling price for self-test kits was not discussed.\n\nAmrahi said the self-test kit cost price is in the range of RM22 to RM32, which is way above the capped price of RM19.90. \u201cAs such, it would be best if KPDNHEP can subsidise the self-test kit costs for community pharmacies,\u201d he said. Amrahi also insisted that KPDNHEP call on suppliers to provide rebates for pharmacies.\n\nAlexander, in a separate statement today, denied MPS\u2019 claims that the decision to cap self-test kit prices was made hastily, saying that KPDNHEP planned for the price ceiling a month ahead of its implementation.\n\nHe said various consultation sessions were held with relevant industry stakeholders, government agencies such as the Ministry of Health and the Royal Customs Department, pharmaceutical associations, manufacturers, distributors, importers, and retailers to obtain accurate information on the supply and sale of the self-test kits.\n\n\u201cAlthough the content of the discussion did not touch specifically on the actual price control, all industry players involved should know that the purpose of the discussion was to obtain counsel on pricing and supply mechanisms,\u201d Alexander said.\n\n\u201cEvery detail and feedback from the engagement session is taken into account by KPDNHEP in implementing the maximum pricing decision provided under Section 4 of the Price Control and Anti-Profiteering Act 2011 (AKHAP 2011) as used for face masks and bottled pure palm cooking oil previously,\u201d Alexander added.\n\nHe said the implementation of the price control and its enforcement on Covid-19 antigen rapid test kit (self-test) in the local market was also approved and supported by the MOH through the Medical Devices Authority (MDA) for national interest to encourage self-monitoring by detecting and controlling the transmission of the Covid-19 disease by consumers.\n\n\u201cI would really appreciate it if MPS is more rational and realistic with the current situation where the self-testing equipment is a sensitive item in terms of pricing and supply to the people during this pandemic.\u201d", "keyword": ["pharmacists", "kits", "ceiling", "kit", "rebates", "supplier", "prices", "price", "mandated", "community", "test", "kpdnhep", "current", "stock",

medical resources, and increase testing in Sabah, Johor, Kedah, Penang, and Kelantan to combat their surging epidemics.\n\nHealth Minister Khairy Jamaluddin today said that the sense of urgency seen in the Greater Klang Valley Special Task Force (GKVSTF) that was launched in July to accelerate the Covid-19 vaccination rollout under Operation Surge Capacity in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur needed to be emulated in the five states that have among the least percentage of vaccinated adults in the country.\n\n\u201cThese states will not only be prioritised in terms of the amount of Covid-19 vaccines they will receive, but we\u2019ve also started to transfer some workforces and medical assets from other states that require less of them, to these states.\n\n\u201cThis is part of a holistic effort to ensure that we can reduce the number of people in Malaysia that need to be hospitalised, have severe symptoms, and die due to the coronavirus,\u201d Khairy told a media briefing in Putrajaya today.\n\nKhairy said out of 15.16 million Covid-19 vaccine doses expected to be rolled out in September, more than half at 8.3 million will go to the five states: Sabah (2.9 million doses), Johor (1.9 million doses), Kedah (1.3 million doses), Kelantan (1.2 million doses), and Penang (1 million doses).\n\nApart from a ramped-up vaccination programme, Khairy said the surge capacity operations will also see increased Covid-19 testing and priority in these states, given their high positive rates and relatively low vaccine coverage.\n\n\u201cBe that as it may, it doesn\u2019t mean that we will reduce testing in other states because most states are still recording positive rates of more than 10 per cent. We have always emphasised on testing, but we also want to do testing in a targeted manner so that we make the best yield from the resources that are available,\u201d Khairy said.\n\nCodeBlue previously reported that Kuala Lumpur and most states reported positive rates exceeding 10 per cent in the past week from August 22 to 28, including Sabah, Kedah, Kelantan, and Perlis with rates above 20 per cent. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a maximum 5 per cent benchmark as an indicator of sufficient testing.\n\nHe said MOH is also working with the private sector to get companies to test their employees. \u201cThis is where if employers want to open up their businesses, they have to step forward to provide testing for their employees, especially for symptomatic, and those who are sick.\u201d\n\nKhairy said the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) will announce a price cap on self-test kits that are currently within the range of RM35 to RM40 apiece.\n\nCodeBlue previously reported worsening outbreaks in Penang, Johor, Kedah, Sabah, Kelantan, and Perak, as these six largely unvaccinated states registered record high infections and deaths, while the Klang Valley crisis in July consumed federal attention and vaccines.\n\nAs of August 31, Perak, Johor, Kelantan, Kedah, and Sabah have the country\u2019s lowest proportion of adults fully inoculated at below 48 per cent, compared to the national 64.2 per cent average.

Guild says suppliers are profiting the most from the ceiling price for Covid-19 self-test kits, while pharmacies are forced to shoulder the cost alone.\n\nKUALA LUMPUR, Sept 3 \u2014 The Malaysian Community Pharmacy Guild (MCPG) today urged the government to mandate supplier credit notes or rebates to community pharmacies for Covid-19 test kit stocks purchased before the imposition of retail ceiling prices.\n\nMCPG president Lovy Beh said while the group welcomed the government\u2019s move to make Covid-19 self-test kits more affordable for ordinary Malaysians, it meant that community pharmacies have to bear the cost of self-test kits purchased at previous prices exceeding the new ceiling price of RM19.90.\n\n\u201cThis means that suppliers have been making hefty profits all these while, even as we succumbed to their requirements like bulk purchasing with various tier pricings, and cash terms in order to maintain a reasonable price for consumers \u2013 affecting our cash flow and stock management.\n\n\u201cThe government, meanwhile, has left us in the dark regarding this new ceiling price. We were not informed or consulted in any way, and are now given a short timeframe to implement it in three days\u2019 time from September 5, 2021,\u201d Beh said in a statement today.\n\nShe said similar issues came about when face mask ceiling prices were introduced last year when the Covid-19 outbreak first began, forcing community pharmacists to shoulder the cost alone, while they took hits to their reputation as professional health care providers.\n\n\u201cIn the future, if ceiling prices are to be introduced, it should be done so from day one and not halfway through. Now pharmacists are portrayed as the villains and the government the heroes, with suppliers profiting the most in this arrangement,\u201d Beh said.\n\nThe government announced yesterday a retail ceiling price of RM19.90 and wholesale ceiling price of RM16 for Covid-19 self-test kits that would come into effect on September 5. Pharmaceutical professional groups, including the Malaysian Pharmacists Society (MPS), however, claimed that the decision was made unilaterally.\n\nMPS president Amrahi Buang said while a meeting was held between industry stakeholders and Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) minister Alexander Nanta Linggi on August 18 to make self-test kits affordable, the actual ceiling price for self-test kits was not discussed.\n\nAmrahi said the self-test kit cost price is in the range of RM22 to RM32, which is way above the capped price of RM19.90. \u201cAs such, it would be best if KPDNHEP can subsidise the self-test kit costs for community pharmacies,\u201d he said. Amrahi also insisted that KPDNHEP call on suppliers to provide rebates for pharmacies.\n\nAlexander, in a separate statement today, denied MPS\u2019 claims that the decision to cap self-test kit prices was made hastily, saying that KPDNHEP planned for the price ceiling a month ahead of its implementation.\n\nHe said various consultation sessions were held with relevant industry stakeholders, government agencies such as the Ministry of Health and the Royal Customs Department, pharmaceutical associations, manufacturers, distributors, importers, and retailers to obtain accurate information on the supply and sale of the self-test kits.\n\n\u201cAlthough the content of the discussion did not touch specifically on the actual price control, all industry players involved should know that the purpose of the discussion was to obtain counsel on pricing and supply mechanisms,\u201d Alexander said.\n\n\u201cEvery detail and feedback from the engagement session is taken into account by KPDNHEP in implementing the maximum pricing decision provided under Section 4 of the Price Control and Anti-Profiteering Act 2011 (AKHAP 2011) as used for face masks and bottled pure palm cooking oil previously,\u201d Alexander added.\n\nHe said the implementation of the price control and its enforcement on Covid-19 antigen rapid test kit (self-test) in the local market was also approved and supported by the MOH through the Medical Devices Authority (MDA) for national interest to encourage self-monitoring by detecting and controlling the transmission of the Covid-19 disease by consumers.\n\n\u201cI would really appreciate it if MPS is more rational and realistic with the current situation where the self-testing equipment is a sensitive item in terms of pricing and supply to the people during this pandemic.\u201d", "keyword": ["pharmacists", "kits", "ceiling", "kit", "rebates", "supplier", "prices", "price", "mandated", "community", "test", "kpdnhep", "current", "stock",

medical resources, and increase testing in Sabah, Johor, Kedah, Penang, and Kelantan to combat their surging epidemics.\n\nHealth Minister Khairy Jamaluddin today said that the sense of urgency seen in the Greater Klang Valley Special Task Force (GKVSTF) that was launched in July to accelerate the Covid-19 vaccination rollout under Operation Surge Capacity in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur needed to be emulated in the five states that have among the least percentage of vaccinated adults in the country.\n\n\u201cThese states will not only be prioritised in terms of the amount of Covid-19 vaccines they will receive, but we\u2019ve also started to transfer some workforces and medical assets from other states that require less of them, to these states.\n\n\u201cThis is part of a holistic effort to ensure that we can reduce the number of people in Malaysia that need to be hospitalised, have severe symptoms, and die due to the coronavirus,\u201d Khairy told a media briefing in Putrajaya today.\n\nKhairy said out of 15.16 million Covid-19 vaccine doses expected to be rolled out in September, more than half at 8.3 million will go to the five states: Sabah (2.9 million doses), Johor (1.9 million doses), Kedah (1.3 million doses), Kelantan (1.2 million doses), and Penang (1 million doses).\n\nApart from a ramped-up vaccination programme, Khairy said the surge capacity operations will also see increased Covid-19 testing and priority in these states, given their high positive rates and relatively low vaccine coverage.\n\n\u201cBe that as it may, it doesn\u2019t mean that we will reduce testing in other states because most states are still recording positive rates of more than 10 per cent. We have always emphasised on testing, but we also want to do testing in a targeted manner so that we make the best yield from the resources that are available,\u201d Khairy said.\n\nCodeBlue previously reported that Kuala Lumpur and most states reported positive rates exceeding 10 per cent in the past week from August 22 to 28, including Sabah, Kedah, Kelantan, and Perlis with rates above 20 per cent. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a maximum 5 per cent benchmark as an indicator of sufficient testing.\n\nHe said MOH is also working with the private sector to get companies to test their employees. \u201cThis is where if employers want to open up their businesses, they have to step forward to provide testing for their employees, especially for symptomatic, and those who are sick.\u201d\n\nKhairy said the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) will announce a price cap on self-test kits that are currently within the range of RM35 to RM40 apiece.\n\nCodeBlue previously reported worsening outbreaks in Penang, Johor, Kedah, Sabah, Kelantan, and Perak, as these six largely unvaccinated states registered record high infections and deaths, while the Klang Valley crisis in July consumed federal attention and vaccines.\n\nAs of August 31, Perak, Johor, Kelantan, Kedah, and Sabah have the country\u2019s lowest proportion of adults fully inoculated at below 48 per cent, compared to the national 64.2 per cent average.

Guild says suppliers are profiting the most from the ceiling price for Covid-19 self-test kits, while pharmacies are forced to shoulder the cost alone.\n\nKUALA LUMPUR, Sept 3 \u2014 The Malaysian Community Pharmacy Guild (MCPG) today urged the government to mandate supplier credit notes or rebates to community pharmacies for Covid-19 test kit stocks purchased before the imposition of retail ceiling prices.\n\nMCPG president Lovy Beh said while the group welcomed the government\u2019s move to make Covid-19 self-test kits more affordable for ordinary Malaysians, it meant that community pharmacies have to bear the cost of self-test kits purchased at previous prices exceeding the new ceiling price of RM19.90.\n\n\u201cThis means that suppliers have been making hefty profits all these while, even as we succumbed to their requirements like bulk purchasing with various tier pricings, and cash terms in order to maintain a reasonable price for consumers \u2013 affecting our cash flow and stock management.\n\n\u201cThe government, meanwhile, has left us in the dark regarding this new ceiling price. We were not informed or consulted in any way, and are now given a short timeframe to implement it in three days\u2019 time from September 5, 2021,\u201d Beh said in a statement today.\n\nShe said similar issues came about when face mask ceiling prices were introduced last year when the Covid-19 outbreak first began, forcing community pharmacists to shoulder the cost alone, while they took hits to their reputation as professional health care providers.\n\n\u201cIn the future, if ceiling prices are to be introduced, it should be done so from day one and not halfway through. Now pharmacists are portrayed as the villains and the government the heroes, with suppliers profiting the most in this arrangement,\u201d Beh said.\n\nThe government announced yesterday a retail ceiling price of RM19.90 and wholesale ceiling price of RM16 for Covid-19 self-test kits that would come into effect on September 5. Pharmaceutical professional groups, including the Malaysian Pharmacists Society (MPS), however, claimed that the decision was made unilaterally.\n\nMPS president Amrahi Buang said while a meeting was held between industry stakeholders and Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) minister Alexander Nanta Linggi on August 18 to make self-test kits affordable, the actual ceiling price for self-test kits was not discussed.\n\nAmrahi said the self-test kit cost price is in the range of RM22 to RM32, which is way above the capped price of RM19.90. \u201cAs such, it would be best if KPDNHEP can subsidise the self-test kit costs for community pharmacies,\u201d he said. Amrahi also insisted that KPDNHEP call on suppliers to provide rebates for pharmacies.\n\nAlexander, in a separate statement today, denied MPS\u2019 claims that the decision to cap self-test kit prices was made hastily, saying that KPDNHEP planned for the price ceiling a month ahead of its implementation.\n\nHe said various consultation sessions were held with relevant industry stakeholders, government agencies such as the Ministry of Health and the Royal Customs Department, pharmaceutical associations, manufacturers, distributors, importers, and retailers to obtain accurate information on the supply and sale of the self-test kits.\n\n\u201cAlthough the content of the discussion did not touch specifically on the actual price control, all industry players involved should know that the purpose of the discussion was to obtain counsel on pricing and supply mechanisms,\u201d Alexander said.\n\n\u201cEvery detail and feedback from the engagement session is taken into account by KPDNHEP in implementing the maximum pricing decision provided under Section 4 of the Price Control and Anti-Profiteering Act 2011 (AKHAP 2011) as used for face masks and bottled pure palm cooking oil previously,\u201d Alexander added.\n\nHe said the implementation of the price control and its enforcement on Covid-19 antigen rapid test kit (self-test) in the local market was also approved and supported by the MOH through the Medical Devices Authority (MDA) for national interest to encourage self-monitoring by detecting and controlling the transmission of the Covid-19 disease by consumers.\n\n\u201cI would really appreciate it if MPS is more rational and realistic with the current situation where the self-testing equipment is a sensitive item in terms of pricing and supply to the people during this pandemic.\u201d", "keyword": ["pharmacists", "kits", "ceiling", "kit", "rebates", "supplier", "prices", "price", "mandated", "community", "test", "kpdnhep", "current", "stock",

medical resources, and increase testing in Sabah, Johor, Kedah, Penang, and Kelantan to combat their surging epidemics.\n\nHealth Minister Khairy Jamaluddin today said that the sense of urgency seen in the Greater Klang Valley Special Task Force (GKVSTF) that was launched in July to accelerate the Covid-19 vaccination rollout under Operation Surge Capacity in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur needed to be emulated in the five states that have among the least percentage of vaccinated adults in the country.\n\n\u201cThese states will not only be prioritised in terms of the amount of Covid-19 vaccines they will receive, but we\u2019ve also started to transfer some workforces and medical assets from other states that require less of them, to these states.\n\n\u201cThis is part of a holistic effort to ensure that we can reduce the number of people in Malaysia that need to be hospitalised, have severe symptoms, and die due to the coronavirus,\u201d Khairy told a media briefing in Putrajaya today.\n\nKhairy said out of 15.16 million Covid-19 vaccine doses expected to be rolled out in September, more than half at 8.3 million will go to the five states: Sabah (2.9 million doses), Johor (1.9 million doses), Kedah (1.3 million doses), Kelantan (1.2 million doses), and Penang (1 million doses).\n\nApart from a ramped-up vaccination programme, Khairy said the surge capacity operations will also see increased Covid-19 testing and priority in these states, given their high positive rates and relatively low vaccine coverage.\n\n\u201cBe that as it may, it doesn\u2019t mean that we will reduce testing in other states because most states are still recording positive rates of more than 10 per cent. We have always emphasised on testing, but we also want to do testing in a targeted manner so that we make the best yield from the resources that are available,\u201d Khairy said.\n\nCodeBlue previously reported that Kuala Lumpur and most states reported positive rates exceeding 10 per cent in the past week from August 22 to 28, including Sabah, Kedah, Kelantan, and Perlis with rates above 20 per cent. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a maximum 5 per cent benchmark as an indicator of sufficient testing.\n\nHe said MOH is also working with the private sector to get companies to test their employees. \u201cThis is where if employers want to open up their businesses, they have to step forward to provide testing for their employees, especially for symptomatic, and those who are sick.\u201d\n\nKhairy said the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) will announce a price cap on self-test kits that are currently within the range of RM35 to RM40 apiece.\n\nCodeBlue previously reported worsening outbreaks in Penang, Johor, Kedah, Sabah, Kelantan, and Perak, as these six largely unvaccinated states registered record high infections and deaths, while the Klang Valley crisis in July consumed federal attention and vaccines.\n\nAs of August 31, Perak, Johor, Kelantan, Kedah, and Sabah have the country\u2019s lowest proportion of adults fully inoculated at below 48 per cent, compared to the national 64.2 per cent average.

Guild says suppliers are profiting the most from the ceiling price for Covid-19 self-test kits, while pharmacies are forced to shoulder the cost alone.\n\nKUALA LUMPUR, Sept 3 \u2014 The Malaysian Community Pharmacy Guild (MCPG) today urged the government to mandate supplier credit notes or rebates to community pharmacies for Covid-19 test kit stocks purchased before the imposition of retail ceiling prices.\n\nMCPG president Lovy Beh said while the group welcomed the government\u2019s move to make Covid-19 self-test kits more affordable for ordinary Malaysians, it meant that community pharmacies have to bear the cost of self-test kits purchased at previous prices exceeding the new ceiling price of RM19.90.\n\n\u201cThis means that suppliers have been making hefty profits all these while, even as we succumbed to their requirements like bulk purchasing with various tier pricings, and cash terms in order to maintain a reasonable price for consumers \u2013 affecting our cash flow and stock management.\n\n\u201cThe government, meanwhile, has left us in the dark regarding this new ceiling price. We were not informed or consulted in any way, and are now given a short timeframe to implement it in three days\u2019 time from September 5, 2021,\u201d Beh said in a statement today.\n\nShe said similar issues came about when face mask ceiling prices were introduced last year when the Covid-19 outbreak first began, forcing community pharmacists to shoulder the cost alone, while they took hits to their reputation as professional health care providers.\n\n\u201cIn the future, if ceiling prices are to be introduced, it should be done so from day one and not halfway through. Now pharmacists are portrayed as the villains and the government the heroes, with suppliers profiting the most in this arrangement,\u201d Beh said.\n\nThe government announced yesterday a retail ceiling price of RM19.90 and wholesale ceiling price of RM16 for Covid-19 self-test kits that would come into effect on September 5. Pharmaceutical professional groups, including the Malaysian Pharmacists Society (MPS), however, claimed that the decision was made unilaterally.\n\nMPS president Amrahi Buang said while a meeting was held between industry stakeholders and Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) minister Alexander Nanta Linggi on August 18 to make self-test kits affordable, the actual ceiling price for self-test kits was not discussed.\n\nAmrahi said the self-test kit cost price is in the range of RM22 to RM32, which is way above the capped price of RM19.90. \u201cAs such, it would be best if KPDNHEP can subsidise the self-test kit costs for community pharmacies,\u201d he said. Amrahi also insisted that KPDNHEP call on suppliers to provide rebates for pharmacies.\n\nAlexander, in a separate statement today, denied MPS\u2019 claims that the decision to cap self-test kit prices was made hastily, saying that KPDNHEP planned for the price ceiling a month ahead of its implementation.\n\nHe said various consultation sessions were held with relevant industry stakeholders, government agencies such as the Ministry of Health and the Royal Customs Department, pharmaceutical associations, manufacturers, distributors, importers, and retailers to obtain accurate information on the supply and sale of the self-test kits.\n\n\u201cAlthough the content of the discussion did not touch specifically on the actual price control, all industry players involved should know that the purpose of the discussion was to obtain counsel on pricing and supply mechanisms,\u201d Alexander said.\n\n\u201cEvery detail and feedback from the engagement session is taken into account by KPDNHEP in implementing the maximum pricing decision provided under Section 4 of the Price Control and Anti-Profiteering Act 2011 (AKHAP 2011) as used for face masks and bottled pure palm cooking oil previously,\u201d Alexander added.\n\nHe said the implementation of the price control and its enforcement on Covid-19 antigen rapid test kit (self-test) in the local market was also approved and supported by the MOH through the Medical Devices Authority (MDA) for national interest to encourage self-monitoring by detecting and controlling the transmission of the Covid-19 disease by consumers.\n\n\u201cI would really appreciate it if MPS is more rational and realistic with the current situation where the self-testing equipment is a sensitive item in terms of pricing and supply to the people during this pandemic.\u201d", "keyword": ["pharmacists", "kits", "ceiling", "kit", "rebates", "supplier", "prices", "price", "mandated", "community", "test", "kpdnhep", "current", "stock",

medical resources, and increase testing in Sabah, Johor, Kedah, Penang, and Kelantan to combat their surging epidemics.\n\nHealth Minister Khairy Jamaluddin today said that the sense of urgency seen in the Greater Klang Valley Special Task Force (GKVSTF) that was launched in July to accelerate the Covid-19 vaccination rollout under Operation Surge Capacity in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur needed to be emulated in the five states that have among the least percentage of vaccinated adults in the country.\n\n\u201cThese states will not only be prioritised in terms of the amount of Covid-19 vaccines they will receive, but we\u2019ve also started to transfer some workforces and medical assets from other states that require less of them, to these states.\n\n\u201cThis is part of a holistic effort to ensure that we can reduce the number of people in Malaysia that need to be hospitalised, have severe symptoms, and die due to the coronavirus,\u201d Khairy told a media briefing in Putrajaya today.\n\nKhairy said out of 15.16 million Covid-19 vaccine doses expected to be rolled out in September, more than half at 8.3 million will go to the five states: Sabah (2.9 million doses), Johor (1.9 million doses), Kedah (1.3 million doses), Kelantan (1.2 million doses), and Penang (1 million doses).\n\nApart from a ramped-up vaccination programme, Khairy said the surge capacity operations will also see increased Covid-19 testing and priority in these states, given their high positive rates and relatively low vaccine coverage.\n\n\u201cBe that as it may, it doesn\u2019t mean that we will reduce testing in other states because most states are still recording positive rates of more than 10 per cent. We have always emphasised on testing, but we also want to do testing in a targeted manner so that we make the best yield from the resources that are available,\u201d Khairy said.\n\nCodeBlue previously reported that Kuala Lumpur and most states reported positive rates exceeding 10 per cent in the past week from August 22 to 28, including Sabah, Kedah, Kelantan, and Perlis with rates above 20 per cent. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a maximum 5 per cent benchmark as an indicator of sufficient testing.\n\nHe said MOH is also working with the private sector to get companies to test their employees. \u201cThis is where if employers want to open up their businesses, they have to step forward to provide testing for their employees, especially for symptomatic, and those who are sick.\u201d\n\nKhairy said the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) will announce a price cap on self-test kits that are currently within the range of RM35 to RM40 apiece.\n\nCodeBlue previously reported worsening outbreaks in Penang, Johor, Kedah, Sabah, Kelantan, and Perak, as these six largely unvaccinated states registered record high infections and deaths, while the Klang Valley crisis in July consumed federal attention and vaccines.\n\nAs of August 31, Perak, Johor, Kelantan, Kedah, and Sabah have the country\u2019s lowest proportion of adults fully inoculated at below 48 per cent, compared to the national 64.2 per cent average.

Guild says suppliers are profiting the most from the ceiling price for Covid-19 self-test kits, while pharmacies are forced to shoulder the cost alone.\n\nKUALA LUMPUR, Sept 3 \u2014 The Malaysian Community Pharmacy Guild (MCPG) today urged the government to mandate supplier credit notes or rebates to community pharmacies for Covid-19 test kit stocks purchased before the imposition of retail ceiling prices.\n\nMCPG president Lovy Beh said while the group welcomed the government\u2019s move to make Covid-19 self-test kits more affordable for ordinary Malaysians, it meant that community pharmacies have to bear the cost of self-test kits purchased at previous prices exceeding the new ceiling price of RM19.90.\n\n\u201cThis means that suppliers have been making hefty profits all these while, even as we succumbed to their requirements like bulk purchasing with various tier pricings, and cash terms in order to maintain a reasonable price for consumers \u2013 affecting our cash flow and stock management.\n\n\u201cThe government, meanwhile, has left us in the dark regarding this new ceiling price. We were not informed or consulted in any way, and are now given a short timeframe to implement it in three days\u2019 time from September 5, 2021,\u201d Beh said in a statement today.\n\nShe said similar issues came about when face mask ceiling prices were introduced last year when the Covid-19 outbreak first began, forcing community pharmacists to shoulder the cost alone, while they took hits to their reputation as professional health care providers.\n\n\u201cIn the future, if ceiling prices are to be introduced, it should be done so from day one and not halfway through. Now pharmacists are portrayed as the villains and the government the heroes, with suppliers profiting the most in this arrangement,\u201d Beh said.\n\nThe government announced yesterday a retail ceiling price of RM19.90 and wholesale ceiling price of RM16 for Covid-19 self-test kits that would come into effect on September 5. Pharmaceutical professional groups, including the Malaysian Pharmacists Society (MPS), however, claimed that the decision was made unilaterally.\n\nMPS president Amrahi Buang said while a meeting was held between industry stakeholders and Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) minister Alexander Nanta Linggi on August 18 to make self-test kits affordable, the actual ceiling price for self-test kits was not discussed.\n\nAmrahi said the self-test kit cost price is in the range of RM22 to RM32, which is way above the capped price of RM19.90. \u201cAs such, it would be best if KPDNHEP can subsidise the self-test kit costs for community pharmacies,\u201d he said. Amrahi also insisted that KPDNHEP call on suppliers to provide rebates for pharmacies.\n\nAlexander, in a separate statement today, denied MPS\u2019 claims that the decision to cap self-test kit prices was made hastily, saying that KPDNHEP planned for the price ceiling a month ahead of its implementation.\n\nHe said various consultation sessions were held with relevant industry stakeholders, government agencies such as the Ministry of Health and the Royal Customs Department, pharmaceutical associations, manufacturers, distributors, importers, and retailers to obtain accurate information on the supply and sale of the self-test kits.\n\n\u201cAlthough the content of the discussion did not touch specifically on the actual price control, all industry players involved should know that the purpose of the discussion was to obtain counsel on pricing and supply mechanisms,\u201d Alexander said.\n\n\u201cEvery detail and feedback from the engagement session is taken into account by KPDNHEP in implementing the maximum pricing decision provided under Section 4 of the Price Control and Anti-Profiteering Act 2011 (AKHAP 2011) as used for face masks and bottled pure palm cooking oil previously,\u201d Alexander added.\n\nHe said the implementation of the price control and its enforcement on Covid-19 antigen rapid test kit (self-test) in the local market was also approved and supported by the MOH through the Medical Devices Authority (MDA) for national interest to encourage self-monitoring by detecting and controlling the transmission of the Covid-19 disease by consumers.\n\n\u201cI would really appreciate it if MPS is more rational and realistic with the current situation where the self-testing equipment is a sensitive item in terms of pricing and supply to the people during this pandemic.\u201d", "keyword": ["pharmacists", "kits", "ceiling", "kit", "rebates", "supplier", "prices", "price", "mandated", "community", "test", "kpdnhep", "current", "stock",

country\u2019s vaccine supply in September, as well as extra medical resources and increased testing.\n\nPUTRAJAYA, Sept 1 \u2014 The federal government will accelerate Covid-19 vaccination, deploy medical resources, and increase testing in Sabah, Johor, Kedah, Penang, and Kelantan to combat their surging epidemics.\n\nHealth Minister Khairy Jamaluddin today said that the sense of urgency seen in the Greater Klang Valley Special Task Force (GKVSTF) that was launched in July to accelerate the Covid-19 vaccination rollout under Operation Surge Capacity in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur needed to be emulated in the five states that have among the least percentage of vaccinated adults in the country.\n\n\u201cThese states will not only be prioritised in terms of the amount of Covid-19 vaccines they will receive, but we\u2019ve also started to transfer some workforces and medical assets from other states that require less of them, to these states.\n\n\u201cThis is part of a holistic effort to ensure that we can reduce the number of people in Malaysia that need to be hospitalised, have severe symptoms, and die due to the coronavirus,\u201d Khairy told a media briefing in Putrajaya today.\n\nKhairy said out of 15.16 million Covid-19 vaccine doses expected to be rolled out in September, more than half at 8.3 million will go to the five states: Sabah (2.9 million doses), Johor (1.9 million doses), Kedah (1.3 million doses), Kelantan (1.2 million doses), and Penang (1 million doses).\n\nApart from a ramped-up vaccination programme, Khairy said the surge capacity operations will also see increased Covid-19 testing and priority in these states, given their high positive rates and relatively low vaccine coverage.\n\n\u201cBe that as it may, it doesn\u2019t mean that we will reduce testing in other states because most states are still recording positive rates of more than 10 per cent. We have always emphasised on testing, but we also want to do testing in a targeted manner so that we make the best yield from the resources that are available,\u201d Khairy said.\n\nCodeBlue previously reported that Kuala Lumpur and most states reported positive rates exceeding 10 per cent in the past week from August 22 to 28, including Sabah, Kedah, Kelantan, and Perlis with rates above 20 per cent. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a maximum 5 per cent benchmark as an indicator of sufficient testing.\n\nHe said MOH is also working with the private sector to get companies to test their employees. \u201cThis is where if employers want to open up their businesses, they have to step forward to provide testing for their employees, especially for symptomatic, and those who are sick.\u201d\n\nKhairy said the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) will announce a price cap on self-test kits that are currently within the range of RM35 to RM40 apiece.\n\nCodeBlue previously reported worsening outbreaks in Penang, Johor, Kedah, Sabah, Kelantan, and Perak, as these six largely unvaccinated states registered record high infections and deaths, while the Klang Valley crisis in July consumed federal attention and vaccines.\n\nAs of August 31, Perak, Johor, Kelantan, Kedah, and Sabah have the country\u2019s lowest proportion of adults fully inoculated at below 48 per cent, compared to the national 64.2 per cent average. Slightly over half of Penang\u2019s adult population has received double jabs.\n\nMalaysia\u2019s national incidence rate in the past month reached about 64 daily cases per 100,000 population, while the mortality rate was an average of about seven fatalities per million people a day.
