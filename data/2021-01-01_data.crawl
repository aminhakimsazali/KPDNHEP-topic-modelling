rivers and rapids,\u201d the ministry said.\n\nIt added that poor connection among infrastructure facilities and various terrain structures such as hills, mountains and islands also contribute to the high transportation costs.\n\nThe programme, which started in 2009, has managed to help the rural community have better access to basic goods like rice, sugar, flour, cooking oil, LPG, RON95 petrol

The implementation of halal certification is governed by the Trade Description Act and Orders related thereto.\n\nThe Act empowers Jakim as a competent authority in the issuance of the halal logo. This is rightly so, as an authority is required to guarantee that the products are genuinely halal in compliance with the Shariah principles. However, Jakim can only carry out inspections to ensure compliance. Any infringement may only result in the withdrawal of Jakim halal certificate. Jakim cannot exercise enforcement power, as the main player under the Act is the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP), while Jakim merely testifies as witnesses.\n\nFurthermore, the law does not impose an obligation that all foods are marked halal. Traders and manufacturers apply for certification voluntarily. If they choose not to apply but opt to forge certification, certainly Jakim could hardly be blamed. In the same way we do not blame Bank Negara for the forged currency floating, so too can we blame Jakim for the forged halal certification. Apart from KPDNHEP, the blame equally lies on the Customs, Royal Malaysia Police and local authorities who have halal execution power in their by-laws.\n\nThe consumption of halal food is a fundamental right of Muslims under the Constitution, yet as of today, our right to get halal food is not strictly guaranteed. The Malay Consultative Council should work towards that direction, rather than admonish a Muslim authority, albeit Jakim.\n\nOne unfortunate shortcoming of Jakim was their delayed reaction in \u201csetting the record straight\u201d. Unfortunately, the world is now \u201cforced\u201d to deal with the \u201cgame of perception\u201d. Keeping quiet, delayed response or failure to anticipate and manage negative perceptions may be at any organisation\u2019s detriment.\n\nThis is not the first time Jakim has been put under scrutiny for matters which were not directly under their purview. In this case, however, Jakim must understand that the word \u201chalal\u201d in itself will pull them into the \u201cfray\u201d regardless of their involvement.\n\nHence, Jakim should at least invest in effective communication and perception management team which would do them a lot of much-deserved justice.", "keyword": ["halal", "compliance", "authority", "scrutiny", "jakim", "pushing", "stop", "blame", "trade", "certification", "act", "food"], "summary": "The implementation of halal certification is governed by the Trade Description Act and Orders related thereto.\nThe Act empowers Jakim as a competent authority in the issuance of the halal logo.\nAny infringement may only result in the withdrawal of Jakim halal certificate.\nIn the same way we do not blame Bank Negara for the forged currency floating, so too can we blame Jakim for the forged halal certification.\nThe consumption of halal food is a fundamental right of Muslims under the Constitution, yet as of today, our right to get halal food is not strictly guaranteed.", "news": "The Malaysian Reserve", "date": "2021-01-07 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "MCO 2.0: Shopping malls can operate", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEG8IJUQ3Meh3UcdzzUFh9KUqGQgEKhAIACoHCAow9sveCjC0m9YBMPDtoQM?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/pogb18_NSTfield_image_socialmedia.var_1610506085.jpg", "text": "", "keyword": ["shopping", "operate", "malls", "mco", "20"], "summary": "", "news": "New Straits Times", "date": "2021-01-13 00:00:00", "language": "INDONESIA"}, {"title": "My Say: Halal meat fiasco begs a system overhaul", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWVkZ2VtYXJrZXRzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL215LXNheS1oYWxhbC1tZWF0LWZpYXNjby1iZWdzLXN5c3RlbS1vdmVyaGF1bNIBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://assets.theedgemarkets.com/Forum-Daging_20210111181717_theedgemarkets.jpg?KUEcITxU5mqfKqlzdYICPqyH.Bfx47eI", "text": "The imported halal meat fiasco has all the elemental components of a crime: smuggling; faking; a network of cheating syndicates, from the starting point to the consumer table; multinational actors to facilitate multiple functions at multiple points; and unchecked and unpunished, allegedly, for 40 years.\n\nIt is another corruption case that the public has to swallow. This time, the public is robbed of safe, genuine, quality and, to the Muslims, halal meat \u2014 a betrayal in all dimensions to consumers.\n\nThe case begs the question as to why it was left unchecked for such a long time. Logically, it means that it must have been well planned, tested and proven, or that the system is so weak that it failed to prevent such a serious situation.\n\nLet us look at the industry landscape that allows such a practice to breed. In 2018, the self-sufficiency level for meat stood at 22%, where the consumption per capita was 6.3kg per year, import value was RM3.8 billion and export value was RM1.2 billion, giving a trade deficit of RM2.6 billion. Similarly, related commodities such as milk and feedstock experienced a deficit of RM2.6 billion and RM10.2 billion respectively in 2018.\n\nThe data implies that, first, the demand for meat and milk is far greater than local supply, which has shown slow growth in the last five decades. Second, Malaysia depends on imported feedstock for her cows.\n\nThe agencies involved in monitoring the sector include the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP), Department of Veterinary Services (DVS), Jabatan Kemajuan Islam Malaysia (Jakim), Malaysian Quarantine and Inspection Services (Maqis), Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), the Royal Malaysian Customs Department (RMCD) and Port Police (PP).\n\nIn simple terms, the cartel uses fake halal certificates for meat from uncertified sources from the point of slaughter, either at the exporting country or at local warehouses, until it reaches consumers. The activities involved are acquisition, storing, processing, smuggling, manipulation, abetting and bringing into the country the non-certified frozen meat through approved import permits.\n\nThe real modus operandi involves a web of collaborative work of the cartel, suppliers, officials and traders both overseas and on the domestic scene. It is alleged that the first point of faking halal certificates may occur at slaughterhouses overseas, which have to get halal certification under the purview of Jakim and DVS. Once the cartel bypasses the first stage of inspection, the rest of the procedures are less of a hurdle.\n\nOnce the meat reaches the ports, the cartel again could move in smoothly with the help of \u201crepresentatives\u201d of very senior officials from government agencies working with it. Upon reaching the warehouses, the meat would be mixed with halal-certified meat and repacked with fake halal logos, then released to the market.\n\nThe supporting structure under which this malpractice takes place is described as follows.\n\nFirst, Malaysia is continuously dependent on meat imports (particularly beef and lamb), owing largely to growing demand, while local production shows the reverse trend. Local production is weak because of low productivity, high cost of production and inefficient small farms. These result in inflows of meat from efficient producers such as Australia, New Zealand and Argentina at relatively lower prices than local sources.\n\nSecond, arbitrage activities thrive when there is a big price gap between two locations. For instance, there are 124 illegal jetties in Kelantan where the black market or smuggling of goods and food commodities has been active for many decades. This occurs because the prices in Thailand are cheaper than in Malaysia. A similar analogy applies in the case of meat imports.\n\nThird, standards, sanitary and phytosanitary requirements and halal certification involve costs and disruption. As such, barriers \u2014 especially those that are messy and costly \u2014 incentivise traders to avoid or bypass the rules wherever possible. Some go to the extreme by violating the law and regulations, especially if the monitoring procedures are weak and ineffective.\n\nFourth, the import industry is oligopolistic in nature, where collusion among members is rampant, as proven in this case.\n\nFifth, it is highly probable that lowly paid government servants are drawn to receive bribes, especially when governance is weak, as proven by the alleged abuse that is said to have occurred for 40 years.\n\nSixth, with six agencies involved in monitoring meat imports, it is highly probable that there exists a redundancy of functions that deter efficiency. Seventh, non-governmental organisations and consumers that have the power to bring about change failed to sound the warning bell.\n\nThe convergence of these factors has led to the scandal being untouched by the law.\n\nWhat are the policy implications? Since this practice has taken root over a long time, no quick solution will undo it. While legal proceedings are a must, medium- and long-term structural changes must be instituted immediately.\n\nFirst, there is an urgent need for a deep inquiry into this matter in terms of the gap between standard operating procedures and reality, the major players that are responsible, the weakest links in the supply chain, the governance structure and the role of public agencies.\n\nSecond, there is an urgent need to increase local production through improvement in productivity and cost reduction. The livestock producers must be empowered with skills, knowledge and advanced technologies to improve production. Production cost can be reduced by using local materials such as palm kernel cake and other sources.\n\nThird, the farmers\u2019 cooperatives have to be strengthened to improve domestic production. Small farms find it hard to sustain production, owing to limited capital for investment but, through this vehicle, they may share resources and gain economies of scale.\n\nFourth, the National Feedlot Centre is not feasible, as it is highly centralised and has proved to be vulnerable to rent-seeking practices in the past. It can be replaced by support measures and incentives to encourage private abattoirs that are more competitive, run either by individuals or cooperatives.\n\nFifth, the cartel can be diffused by competition. The import sector should be opened up to more participants so that market control or any predatory move is checked by the competing participants.\n\nSixth, the data speaks the truth. Digitalisation of the supply chain may provide transactional transparency to all participants, hence minimising malpractices. Among the applications are blockchain, an information and communications technology solution whose distributed ledger technology allows data to be stored on servers. It creates secure, real-time communication networks with partners along the supply chain. The system makes it difficult for one user to gain control of, or game, the network.\n\nMaybe Malaysia is not ready for this, but the concept is of high utility. For a start, the country should focus on developing a complete database of who is doing what as well as their business profile. Data to be monitored is all the players\u2019 profiles, including overseas slaughter houses, in terms of production, quantity and quality traded, price, origin or source of meat, and prices. From the data one can detect irregularities such as a sudden increase in quantity or changes in prices or sources of origin. Such tracking may minimise malpractices along the supply chain. Once these databases are running well, then more sophisticated transaction apps such as blockchain may be considered.\n\nIn short, the issue of fake halal certificates is just a symptom of a deeper structural disease. This refers to a non-transparent procurement system, weak governance, oligopolistic import market and too many agencies involved, resulting in fragmented monitoring and attractive arbitrage opportunities, owing to low domestic production. It mirrors a systemic failure that requires a system overhaul.\n\nProf Datin Paduka Fatimah Mohamed Arshad is head of the agriculture and food security cluster at the Academy of Professors Malaysia.

Baru and See had betrayed the party by leaving PKR early last year and the departure of Baru had contributed to the downfall of the Pakatan Harapan (PH) federal government at the time.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference at the PKR Kuching and Stampin Branch office at Jalan Sin Sin Park here today, Ng admitted the state PKR had been weakened following the departure of the duo.\n\n\u201cHowever, it only makes us more determined to come back especially in the seats that these people won under PKR. The party is weakened, no doubt, but we will rise again in debacle.\n\n\u201cThey betrayed not only the party but contributed to the downfall of PH. We call them traitors. The party must learn from the setback,\u201d said the former Padungan assemblyman who served from 2006 to 2011.\n\nBaru and See contested and won in the 2016 state polls under the ticket of PKR, but they joined PSB late May last year, after being sacked by PKR following the collapse of the PH government.

It is best for Baru to explain to the public whether he was expelled or he left the party.\n\n\u201cHe should explain to the people, and not keeping quiet,\u201d he said, with Ng adding: \u201cOh, he described himself as a \u2018clever frog\u2019.\u201d\n\nJoshua, who has been with PKR since 2009, said Baru was not thrown out by the party.

for a policy to address birds\u2019 nests on electricity pylons or telecommunication towers.\n\nIn a statement today, MNS Terengganu said it was informed of an active white-bellied sea eagle nest on a telecommunication tower in Merang, Terengganu, which had newly-laid eggs but was \u201cdestroyed\u201d by the tower operators.\n\nThe eagles are classified as a totally protected species under the Wildlife Conservation Act 2010.\n\n\u201cThis is against the Wildlife Conservation Act 2010.\n\n\u201cRather than wait a few months for the family of eagles to raise their young, their future was abruptly terminated,\u201d MNS Terengganu chairman Wong Chee Ho said.\n\nNoting that the country currently lacks any policies on how to deal with nests on towers, Wong proposed a meeting with power company operators in Terengganu, as well as the telecommunication companies that use such towers, to formulate a statewide solution which would be the first for the country.\n\n\u201cWe want to create a new policy to better manage this problem in a way that protects wildlife and ensures the safety of all, including meeting the needs of the corporations and the services they provide.\n\n\u201cThe costs of monitoring all towers and keeping them nest-free is much more than the cost of supporting new and innovative ways of learning to live with the birds,\u201d he said.\n\nWong noted that while many eagles have traditionally constructed their nests on tall trees, more of them are using man-made structures instead.\n\nApart from being taller than many of the surrounding trees and giving birds of prey a better vantage point to survey their territory, such structures are also sturdy and able to support large nests.\n\nWith the expansion of electricity distribution over the past century, and the more recent surge in telecommunication towers, more birds are choosing man-made structures to build their nests.\n\nHowever, nesting birds are known to have disrupted electricity and telecommunication services provided through the towers, while nests made of dry wood and grass can cause fires which lead to service loss for the public and expensive repairs for the companies involved.\n\nPointing out that birds like the white-bellied sea eagle are territorial, Wong said once they have selected a site to nest, they will return to it year after year and rebuild even if their nests are removed.\n\nWhile he admitted some nests will have to be removed as they pose a threat to the company and the birds themselves, Wong stressed the need for a policy on nest removal that does not destroy wildlife.\n\n\u201cPower and telecommunication companies need to explore other ways to resolve this conflict,\u201d he said, suggesting a few solutions that could be

The Yuet Wan is likely the only group still active in Malaysia,\u201d he told theSun.\n\nLeong lays the blame partly on the failure to instil a love for the art among the younger people.\n\nAs a young man practising an age-old art, he is a rarity. He still dons the full regalia for the occasional performance.\n\nLeong laments the fact that many sifus, or masters of the art form, have not been able to find sufficient interest among the younger generation to whom they can pass on their skills.\n\nOpera, Leong pointed out, is an art form that takes years to learn and even longer to perfect. Another setback is the high cost of the costumes.\n\n\u201cOur costumes cost thousands of ringgit, but we do not earn enough to cover even a fraction of that,\u201d he added.\n\nA three-night performance today would bring barely RM400 to the table. But the destroyer of the opera may yet be its saviour.\n\nLeong is looking to new technology to advance a bold plan \u2013 to give Cantonese opera a revival. He has assembled a troupe of 10 young social media wizards to advance his plan.\n\n\u201cThe young participants have paved more paths for better exposure of Cantonese opera through Facebook and Instagram,\u201d he said.\n\nMany challenges remain.\n\n\u201cFor instance, there are not enough musically-talented people who are interested in opera,\u201d he said.\n\nLeong, who has been pursuing his love for the art with the association since 2016, said the immediate priority is to find a new set of talents who can play traditional Chinese musical instruments.\n\n\u201cWe strive for authenticity so we don\u2019t use pre-recorded music for our shows. We still rely on older members to provide the music but we need younger people to take over,\u201d he said.\n\nLots of practice is essential, as the association\u2019s long-time sifu Yoong Poo Hiong pointed out. \u201cShe often reminds us to follow her teachings closely so we may pass on the \u2018full package\u2019 to the next generation. This is a life-long learning experience.\u201d\n\nLeong still harbours hopes that more young people will be drawn to the art.\n\n\u201cI would like to see the Cantonese opera recognised as a Malaysian art form although it originates in China.\n\n\u201cThe Tourism, Arts and Culture Ministry should look into rekindling dying arts and traditions such as ours to boost tourism.

MOH Explains What Happens\n\n1. Get in touch with your district health office\n\nIf you suspect you have contracted the illness, get yourself tested. If you have already tested positive, the Health Ministry\u2019s tweet says that the district health office will contact patients to undergo Covid-19 swab tests.\n\nOnce confirmed positive, they will provide a Monitoring and Observation Order and a quarantine band for positive patients staying at home.\n\n2. The positive patient will need to stay at home for 10 days\n\nQuarantine at home will mean that you won\u2019t be allowed to leave your house for any reason for the period of 10 days.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) also advises that you avoid having visitors over and that they should not interact with the patient under any circumstances.\n\n3. The positive patient should not share a room with any other household members\n\nEven though still at home, you\u2019ll have to separate yourself from the rest of your household to avoid accidentally infecting them. (Credit: Unsplash)\n\nUnless this is possible, home quarantine shouldn\u2019t be your first choice.\n\nA separate room with adequate ventilation should be allocated for the patient. Other household members should stay and sleep in another room and be separated from the patient at all times.\n\nIf possible, other household members should also avoid sharing the same bathroom with the infected person. If you have no choice, WHO advises that taps, doorknobs, and other items are cleaned regularly with soap and water.\n\n4. Household members will have to always wear a face mask and maintain 1 \u2013 2 meters of physical distance from the patient\n\nYes, if you are positive and choose to quarantine at home, your other household members will have to constantly wear a face mask while at home. You must also constantly maintain a physical distance from them to avoid getting them infected as well.\n\n5. Meals, drinks and other essential items should be placed outside the patient\u2019s room door to be taken by themselves\n\nYou and your household members will need to constantly wear a mask while at home during your quarantine period and maintain physical distance from you at all times. (Credit: Unsplash)\n\nPractice contactless delivery when passing food and other essential items to the patient to minimise physical contact between the positive individuals and other members of the household.\n\n6. Other household members will need to wear gloves when handling items used by the positive patient.\n\nWhen handling items used by the infected individual, such as plates, cups, and eating utensils, household members will need to wear disposable gloves.\n\nAfter use, the gloves should be properly discarded without reuse, preferably in a closed container.\n\nWHO advises that separate dishes, cups, eating utensils, bedding, towels, and other essential items be assigned for the infected person.\n\nBeddings, towels, and clothes used by the infected person should be washed with soap and water separately from those used by the rest of the household.\n\n7. The positive patient and other household members should wash their hands with soap and water or use hand sanitiser as frequently as possible.\n\nFrequently washing your hands will reduce the chances of your household members contracting the infection from you.\n\nWash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds at a time and use alcohol-based hand sanitiser when you don\u2019t have the immediate option of using water and soap.\n\nHousehold members should also avoid touching their eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.\n\n8.

Sure, maybe instant noodles or spaghetti might be simple enough to whip up, but Malaysians need good \u2018ol Malaysian food to keep ourselves happy.\n\nBut Malaysian food, such as sambal belacan, is notoriously labourous and difficult, and you have no real cooking experience\u2026 is it possible?\n\nActually, the answer is yes. If someone else has already done all the hard parts of cooking for you.\n\nWe spoke to celebrity chef Sherson Lian, who gave us some tips and tricks on how to make an extremely simple Malaysia\u2019s favourite ikan sambal belacan with almost none of the labour that comes with it.\n\n3-Ingredient Ikan Sambal Belacan\n\nIngredients:\n\nIkan kembung (leatherjacket fish, readily available already cleaned, gutted, and descaled at grocery stores or at the fishmonger\u2019s)\n\nTumeric\n\nSalt\n\nPre-made sambal belacan paste\n\nBanana leaves (optional)\n\nFish, sambal belacan paste, and tumeric. That\u2019s all you need.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\nPreperation:\n\n1) Pat dry the fish. Cut two pockets on both sides along the fish\u2019s spine. (Chef\u2019s note: If you are having trouble with slicing through the flesh, try sharpening your knife. A dull knife can easily cause injuries to yourself.)\n\n2) Give the fish a generous tumeric rub to get rid of its fishy smell, including the insides of the pockets. Then, season it with a little salt.\n\nDo it like salt bae.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\n3) Scoop your sambal belacan paste into the pockets. Be generous with it, but most importantly, use a new clean and dry spoon in between the scoops as you do not want to contaminate the sambal paste.\n\nPockets are meant to be stuffed.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\n4) Heat up a pan to medium-high heat. If you have banana leaves, place it in the pan.\n\n5) Drizzle some oil over the fish. Then, place the fish in the pan.\n\nUse tongs to make it easier to handle the fish.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\n6) Flip the fish and ensure both sides are cooked. (Chef\u2019s note: Ikan kembung has thick skin, so the usual way to check if it\u2019s cooked by poking a fork into the meat won\u2019t work. Instead, check the eyes- they should turn completely white. However, you can leave it to cook a little longer if you\u2019re not sure as this fish is very forgiving to being overcooked.)\n\n7) Serve with rice and enjoy.\n\nA hot, piping meal is ready, all from the comfort of your own home.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\nSherson notes that sambal belacan is one of those sides that goes well with everything and every family has their own secret recipe. Still, it\u2019s a great beginner paste, and you can easily modify the recipe or use different kinds of protein to pair with the sambal belacan.\n\nIf you put the ikan sambal belacan on a fresh piece of bana leaf with some ceylon as garnish, you could even impress a date!\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\nThe one used here is from Sherson\u2019s line of Rencah pastes and condiments and is also used in his restaurants.

The implementation of halal certification is governed by the Trade Description Act and Orders related thereto.\n\nThe Act empowers Jakim as a competent authority in the issuance of the halal logo. This is rightly so, as an authority is required to guarantee that the products are genuinely halal in compliance with the Shariah principles. However, Jakim can only carry out inspections to ensure compliance. Any infringement may only result in the withdrawal of Jakim halal certificate. Jakim cannot exercise enforcement power, as the main player under the Act is the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP), while Jakim merely testifies as witnesses.\n\nFurthermore, the law does not impose an obligation that all foods are marked halal. Traders and manufacturers apply for certification voluntarily. If they choose not to apply but opt to forge certification, certainly Jakim could hardly be blamed. In the same way we do not blame Bank Negara for the forged currency floating, so too can we blame Jakim for the forged halal certification. Apart from KPDNHEP, the blame equally lies on the Customs, Royal Malaysia Police and local authorities who have halal execution power in their by-laws.\n\nThe consumption of halal food is a fundamental right of Muslims under the Constitution, yet as of today, our right to get halal food is not strictly guaranteed. The Malay Consultative Council should work towards that direction, rather than admonish a Muslim authority, albeit Jakim.\n\nOne unfortunate shortcoming of Jakim was their delayed reaction in \u201csetting the record straight\u201d. Unfortunately, the world is now \u201cforced\u201d to deal with the \u201cgame of perception\u201d. Keeping quiet, delayed response or failure to anticipate and manage negative perceptions may be at any organisation\u2019s detriment.\n\nThis is not the first time Jakim has been put under scrutiny for matters which were not directly under their purview. In this case, however, Jakim must understand that the word \u201chalal\u201d in itself will pull them into the \u201cfray\u201d regardless of their involvement.\n\nHence, Jakim should at least invest in effective communication and perception management team which would do them a lot of much-deserved justice.", "keyword": ["halal", "compliance", "authority", "scrutiny", "jakim", "pushing", "stop", "blame", "trade", "certification", "act", "food"], "summary": "The implementation of halal certification is governed by the Trade Description Act and Orders related thereto.\nThe Act empowers Jakim as a competent authority in the issuance of the halal logo.\nAny infringement may only result in the withdrawal of Jakim halal certificate.\nIn the same way we do not blame Bank Negara for the forged currency floating, so too can we blame Jakim for the forged halal certification.\nThe consumption of halal food is a fundamental right of Muslims under the Constitution, yet as of today, our right to get halal food is not strictly guaranteed.", "news": "The Malaysian Reserve", "date": "2021-01-07 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "MCO 2.0: Shopping malls can operate", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEG8IJUQ3Meh3UcdzzUFh9KUqGQgEKhAIACoHCAow9sveCjC0m9YBMPDtoQM?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/pogb18_NSTfield_image_socialmedia.var_1610506085.jpg", "text": "", "keyword": ["shopping", "operate", "malls", "mco", "20"], "summary": "", "news": "New Straits Times", "date": "2021-01-13 00:00:00", "language": "INDONESIA"}, {"title": "My Say: Halal meat fiasco begs a system overhaul", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWVkZ2VtYXJrZXRzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL215LXNheS1oYWxhbC1tZWF0LWZpYXNjby1iZWdzLXN5c3RlbS1vdmVyaGF1bNIBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://assets.theedgemarkets.com/Forum-Daging_20210111181717_theedgemarkets.jpg?KUEcITxU5mqfKqlzdYICPqyH.Bfx47eI", "text": "The imported halal meat fiasco has all the elemental components of a crime: smuggling; faking; a network of cheating syndicates, from the starting point to the consumer table; multinational actors to facilitate multiple functions at multiple points; and unchecked and unpunished, allegedly, for 40 years.\n\nIt is another corruption case that the public has to swallow. This time, the public is robbed of safe, genuine, quality and, to the Muslims, halal meat \u2014 a betrayal in all dimensions to consumers.\n\nThe case begs the question as to why it was left unchecked for such a long time. Logically, it means that it must have been well planned, tested and proven, or that the system is so weak that it failed to prevent such a serious situation.\n\nLet us look at the industry landscape that allows such a practice to breed. In 2018, the self-sufficiency level for meat stood at 22%, where the consumption per capita was 6.3kg per year, import value was RM3.8 billion and export value was RM1.2 billion, giving a trade deficit of RM2.6 billion. Similarly, related commodities such as milk and feedstock experienced a deficit of RM2.6 billion and RM10.2 billion respectively in 2018.\n\nThe data implies that, first, the demand for meat and milk is far greater than local supply, which has shown slow growth in the last five decades. Second, Malaysia depends on imported feedstock for her cows.\n\nThe agencies involved in monitoring the sector include the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP), Department of Veterinary Services (DVS), Jabatan Kemajuan Islam Malaysia (Jakim), Malaysian Quarantine and Inspection Services (Maqis), Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), the Royal Malaysian Customs Department (RMCD) and Port Police (PP).\n\nIn simple terms, the cartel uses fake halal certificates for meat from uncertified sources from the point of slaughter, either at the exporting country or at local warehouses, until it reaches consumers. The activities involved are acquisition, storing, processing, smuggling, manipulation, abetting and bringing into the country the non-certified frozen meat through approved import permits.\n\nThe real modus operandi involves a web of collaborative work of the cartel, suppliers, officials and traders both overseas and on the domestic scene. It is alleged that the first point of faking halal certificates may occur at slaughterhouses overseas, which have to get halal certification under the purview of Jakim and DVS. Once the cartel bypasses the first stage of inspection, the rest of the procedures are less of a hurdle.\n\nOnce the meat reaches the ports, the cartel again could move in smoothly with the help of \u201crepresentatives\u201d of very senior officials from government agencies working with it. Upon reaching the warehouses, the meat would be mixed with halal-certified meat and repacked with fake halal logos, then released to the market.\n\nThe supporting structure under which this malpractice takes place is described as follows.\n\nFirst, Malaysia is continuously dependent on meat imports (particularly beef and lamb), owing largely to growing demand, while local production shows the reverse trend. Local production is weak because of low productivity, high cost of production and inefficient small farms. These result in inflows of meat from efficient producers such as Australia, New Zealand and Argentina at relatively lower prices than local sources.\n\nSecond, arbitrage activities thrive when there is a big price gap between two locations. For instance, there are 124 illegal jetties in Kelantan where the black market or smuggling of goods and food commodities has been active for many decades. This occurs because the prices in Thailand are cheaper than in Malaysia. A similar analogy applies in the case of meat imports.\n\nThird, standards, sanitary and phytosanitary requirements and halal certification involve costs and disruption. As such, barriers \u2014 especially those that are messy and costly \u2014 incentivise traders to avoid or bypass the rules wherever possible. Some go to the extreme by violating the law and regulations, especially if the monitoring procedures are weak and ineffective.\n\nFourth, the import industry is oligopolistic in nature, where collusion among members is rampant, as proven in this case.\n\nFifth, it is highly probable that lowly paid government servants are drawn to receive bribes, especially when governance is weak, as proven by the alleged abuse that is said to have occurred for 40 years.\n\nSixth, with six agencies involved in monitoring meat imports, it is highly probable that there exists a redundancy of functions that deter efficiency. Seventh, non-governmental organisations and consumers that have the power to bring about change failed to sound the warning bell.\n\nThe convergence of these factors has led to the scandal being untouched by the law.\n\nWhat are the policy implications? Since this practice has taken root over a long time, no quick solution will undo it. While legal proceedings are a must, medium- and long-term structural changes must be instituted immediately.\n\nFirst, there is an urgent need for a deep inquiry into this matter in terms of the gap between standard operating procedures and reality, the major players that are responsible, the weakest links in the supply chain, the governance structure and the role of public agencies.\n\nSecond, there is an urgent need to increase local production through improvement in productivity and cost reduction. The livestock producers must be empowered with skills, knowledge and advanced technologies to improve production. Production cost can be reduced by using local materials such as palm kernel cake and other sources.\n\nThird, the farmers\u2019 cooperatives have to be strengthened to improve domestic production. Small farms find it hard to sustain production, owing to limited capital for investment but, through this vehicle, they may share resources and gain economies of scale.\n\nFourth, the National Feedlot Centre is not feasible, as it is highly centralised and has proved to be vulnerable to rent-seeking practices in the past. It can be replaced by support measures and incentives to encourage private abattoirs that are more competitive, run either by individuals or cooperatives.\n\nFifth, the cartel can be diffused by competition. The import sector should be opened up to more participants so that market control or any predatory move is checked by the competing participants.\n\nSixth, the data speaks the truth. Digitalisation of the supply chain may provide transactional transparency to all participants, hence minimising malpractices. Among the applications are blockchain, an information and communications technology solution whose distributed ledger technology allows data to be stored on servers. It creates secure, real-time communication networks with partners along the supply chain. The system makes it difficult for one user to gain control of, or game, the network.\n\nMaybe Malaysia is not ready for this, but the concept is of high utility. For a start, the country should focus on developing a complete database of who is doing what as well as their business profile. Data to be monitored is all the players\u2019 profiles, including overseas slaughter houses, in terms of production, quantity and quality traded, price, origin or source of meat, and prices. From the data one can detect irregularities such as a sudden increase in quantity or changes in prices or sources of origin. Such tracking may minimise malpractices along the supply chain. Once these databases are running well, then more sophisticated transaction apps such as blockchain may be considered.\n\nIn short, the issue of fake halal certificates is just a symptom of a deeper structural disease. This refers to a non-transparent procurement system, weak governance, oligopolistic import market and too many agencies involved, resulting in fragmented monitoring and attractive arbitrage opportunities, owing to low domestic production.

simple, clear SOPs for the public to follow.\n\nChan, who is also the secretary of Democratic Action Party (DAP) Sabah, opined that the business sectors that were allowed to operate during MCO could be determined by common sense, whereas the sectors or services that were prohibited from opening should comply with the directive.\n\nFor instance, night markets, reflexologies, spa, hair salons, optical shops, boutiques, sports and recreational activities (except for jogging limited to two persons from the same household and cycling), mass gatherings, tourism activities, tuition classes, music classes, dance classes, language classes, entertainment outlets, indoor playground, karaoke outlets, cinemas, meetings, seminars, exhibitions, wedding banquets, birthdays and interstate and inter-district travels were banned unless in emergency situation, while employees in essential sectors must show their work pass or employer\u2019s authorization letter.\n\nHe said the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) has issued a statement on Tuesday detailing the permitted activities under the trade and distribution sector, which included shopping malls, supermarkets and hypermarkets, departmental stores, pharmacies, convenience stores, laundry shops (excluding self-service), restaurants, furniture shops, jewellery stores, electric and electronics stores,

Malaysian Islamic Development Department (Jakim).A raid on the factory was done after one month of surveillance, the department's director Muhamad Zikri Azan Abdullah said.\n\"The company\u2019s halal logo issued by Jakim was cancelled on Oct 28 last year, on the grounds that the company had failed to observe the halal compliance requirements especially pertaining to the cleanliness of the premises.\u201cDuring the raid, the company\u2019s representative also informed that they had made an appeal regarding the withdrawal of the halal certificate, but this was rejected as the company failed to act on the religious department\u2019s instructions within the stipulated period,\" he reportedly said.The authorities are investigating the case under Paragraph 4 of the Trade Descriptions (Definition of Halal) Order 2011 and Regulation 4 of the Trade Descriptions (Certification and Marking of Halal) Order 2011.It's really not that easy to get Halal certification and it's more than just the meat used in a product.Besides using only halal mean for production and in a premise, there are other requirements that a company has to meet to get the certification.One of it is cleanliness, which this particular noodle company seem to have neglected.According to Malaysian Halal Certification Procedure Manual , in order to get a Halal certification, a company \"during preparation, handling, processing, packaging, storage or transfer of products, they shall be in compliance to requirements by the Shariah law and remain clean as well as comply to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP)/ Good Hygienic Practices (GHP)\", among other things.Other provision regarding cleanliness in the manual includes:You can see the full list of requirements to get a Halal certification here",

Ba Kelalan assemblyman Baru Bian and Batu Lintang assemblyman See Chee How \u2018traitors\u2019 for joining Parti Sarawak Bersatu (PSB) last year.\n\nIts Kuching branch chief Dominique Ng said both Baru and See had betrayed the party by leaving PKR early last year and the departure of Baru had contributed to the downfall of the Pakatan Harapan (PH) federal government at the time.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference at the PKR Kuching and Stampin Branch office at Jalan Sin Sin Park here today, Ng admitted the state PKR had been weakened following the departure of the duo.\n\n\u201cHowever, it only makes us more determined to come back especially in the seats that these people won under PKR. The party is weakened, no doubt, but we will rise again in debacle.\n\n\u201cThey betrayed not only the party but contributed to the downfall of PH. We call them traitors. The party must learn from the setback,\u201d said the former Padungan assemblyman who served from 2006 to 2011.\n\nBaru and See contested and won in the 2016 state polls under the ticket of PKR, but they joined PSB late May last year, after being sacked by PKR following the collapse of the PH government. Baru, who is Selangau MP, is former Works Minister.\n\nState PKR secretary Joshua Jabeng, who was also present, said the party noted that political analysts and even the media had dubbed PKR as \u201ca gone case\u201d given the departure of Baru and See.\n\n\u201cPolitical scientists and the media have been running us down. Some even said PKR expelled them. It is best for Baru to explain to the public whether he was expelled or he left the party.\n\n\u201cHe should explain to the people, and not keeping quiet,\u201d he said, with Ng adding: \u201cOh, he described himself as a \u2018clever frog\u2019.\u201d\n\nJoshua, who has been with PKR since 2009, said Baru was not thrown out by the party. He even recalled that he \u201cstepped aside in Selangau\u201d for Baru to stand.\n\n\u201cMy heart is so big. He\u2019d been the state chief.

for a policy to address birds\u2019 nests on electricity pylons or telecommunication towers.\n\nIn a statement today, MNS Terengganu said it was informed of an active white-bellied sea eagle nest on a telecommunication tower in Merang, Terengganu, which had newly-laid eggs but was \u201cdestroyed\u201d by the tower operators.\n\nThe eagles are classified as a totally protected species under the Wildlife Conservation Act 2010.\n\n\u201cThis is against the Wildlife Conservation Act 2010.\n\n\u201cRather than wait a few months for the family of eagles to raise their young, their future was abruptly terminated,\u201d MNS Terengganu chairman Wong Chee Ho said.\n\nNoting that the country currently lacks any policies on how to deal with nests on towers, Wong proposed a meeting with power company operators in Terengganu, as well as the telecommunication companies that use such towers, to formulate a statewide solution which would be the first for the country.\n\n\u201cWe want to create a new policy to better manage this problem in a way that protects wildlife and ensures the safety of all, including meeting the needs of the corporations and the services they provide.\n\n\u201cThe costs of monitoring all towers and keeping them nest-free is much more than the cost of supporting new and innovative ways of learning to live with the birds,\u201d he said.\n\nWong noted that while many eagles have traditionally constructed their nests on tall trees, more of them are using man-made structures instead.\n\nApart from being taller than many of the surrounding trees and giving birds of prey a better vantage point to survey their territory, such structures are also sturdy and able to support large nests.\n\nWith the expansion of electricity distribution over the past century, and the more recent surge in telecommunication towers, more birds are choosing man-made structures to build their nests.\n\nHowever, nesting birds are known to have disrupted electricity and telecommunication services provided through the towers, while nests made of dry wood and grass can cause fires which lead to service loss for the public and expensive repairs for the companies involved.\n\nPointing out that birds like the white-bellied sea eagle are territorial, Wong said once they have selected a site to nest, they will return to it year after year and rebuild even if their nests are removed.\n\nWhile he admitted some nests will have to be removed as they pose a threat to the company and the birds themselves, Wong stressed the need for a policy on nest removal that does not destroy wildlife.\n\n\u201cPower and telecommunication companies need to explore other ways to resolve this conflict,\u201d he said, suggesting a few solutions that could be incorporated.\n\n\u201cOne solution could be adding a platform to the towers, placed in a safe location, and made suitable for birds of prey to use as nesting platforms.\n\n\u201cCameras could be installed to record video of the nesting birds. This video could be shared as a live feed to generate interest among the public and showcase conservation activities of the corporations involved.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["nesting", "terengganu", "towers", "structures", "wildlife", "policy", "birds", "regrets", "eagles", "telecommunication", "nature", "nests", "removal", "rare", "telco", "nest", "group", "tower"], "summary": "PETALING JAYA: The Malaysian Nature Society (MNS) has called for a policy to address birds\u2019 nests on electricity pylons or telecommunication towers.\nIn a statement today, MNS Terengganu said it was informed of an active white-bellied sea eagle nest on a telecommunication tower in Merang, Terengganu, which had newly-laid eggs but was \u201cdestroyed\u201d by the tower operators.\nThe eagles are classified as a totally protected species under the Wildlife Conservation Act 2010.\nWong noted that while many eagles have traditionally constructed their nests on tall trees, more of them are using man-made structures instead.\n\u201cCameras could be installed to record video of the nesting birds.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-01-11 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Breathing new life into dying art form", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN1bmRhaWx5Lm15L2xvY2FsL2JyZWF0aGluZy1uZXctbGlmZS1pbnRvLWR5aW5nLWFydC1mb3JtLUFGNjA0Mzk5MtIBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://www.thesundaily.my/binrepository/480x320/0c6/480d250/none/11808/NOOF/image-1981530_1983190_20210111114043.jpg", "text": "BACK when the web was what spiders spun and the TV was in black and white, the Chinese opera was the entertainment that drew large crowds.\n\nToday, such performances are staged only occasionally, mostly on significant dates such as the Hungry Ghost Festival.\n\nFor the younger generation, who have unlimited entertainment options thanks to new technology, sitting in the moonlight for a\n\nthree-hour stage retelling of palace intrigue or lost love is no longer as magical.\n\nBut, if Chinese opera enthusiast Daryl Leong, 43, has his way, the lost art may yet get a revival, thanks to technology.\n\nIn Malaysia, the Chinese opera, in various dialects such as Cantonese, Teochew and Hokkien, had its hey day in the 1920s and 1930s,\n\nwhen several troupes travelled across the country to perform for eager fans.\n\nHowever, the number of local troupes eventually dwindled, replaced mostly by those from Thailand, particularly for performances in the Teochew dialect.\n\nAccording to Leong, who is chief secretary of the Yuet Wan Cantonese Opera Association Kuala Lumpur, urbanisation and globalisation also led to a decline, and eventual demise, of the opera.\n\n\u201cMany associations folded up when their opera troupes could not keep up with the times. The Yuet Wan is likely the only group still active in Malaysia,\u201d he told theSun.\n\nLeong lays the blame partly on the failure to instil a love for the art among the younger people.\n\nAs a young man practising an age-old art, he is a rarity. He still dons the full regalia for the occasional performance.\n\nLeong laments the fact that many sifus, or masters of the art form, have not been able to find sufficient interest among the younger generation to whom they can pass on their skills.\n\nOpera, Leong pointed out, is an art form that takes years to learn and even longer to perfect. Another setback is the high cost of the costumes.\n\n\u201cOur costumes cost thousands of ringgit, but we do not earn enough to cover even a fraction of that,\u201d he added.\n\nA three-night performance today would bring barely RM400 to the table. But the destroyer of the opera may yet be its saviour.\n\nLeong is looking to new technology to advance a bold plan \u2013 to give Cantonese opera a revival. He has assembled a troupe of 10 young social media wizards to advance his plan.\n\n\u201cThe young participants have paved more paths for better exposure of Cantonese opera through Facebook and Instagram,\u201d he said.\n\nMany challenges remain.\n\n\u201cFor instance, there are not enough musically-talented people who are interested in opera,\u201d he said.\n\nLeong, who has been pursuing his love for the art with the association since 2016, said the immediate priority is to find a new set of talents who can play traditional Chinese musical instruments.\n\n\u201cWe strive for authenticity so we don\u2019t use pre-recorded music for our shows. We still rely on older members to provide the music but we need younger people to take over,\u201d he said.\n\nLots of practice is essential, as the association\u2019s long-time sifu Yoong Poo Hiong pointed out. \u201cShe often reminds us to follow her teachings closely so we may pass on the \u2018full package\u2019 to the next generation. This is a life-long learning experience.\u201d\n\nLeong still harbours hopes that more young people will be drawn to the art.\n\n\u201cI would like to see the Cantonese opera recognised as a Malaysian art form although it originates in China.\n\n\u201cThe Tourism, Arts and Culture Ministry should look into rekindling dying arts and traditions such as ours to boost tourism.

The positive patient will need to stay at home for 10 days\n\nQuarantine at home will mean that you won\u2019t be allowed to leave your house for any reason for the period of 10 days.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) also advises that you avoid having visitors over and that they should not interact with the patient under any circumstances.\n\n3. The positive patient should not share a room with any other household members\n\nEven though still at home, you\u2019ll have to separate yourself from the rest of your household to avoid accidentally infecting them. (Credit: Unsplash)\n\nUnless this is possible, home quarantine shouldn\u2019t be your first choice.\n\nA separate room with adequate ventilation should be allocated for the patient. Other household members should stay and sleep in another room and be separated from the patient at all times.\n\nIf possible, other household members should also avoid sharing the same bathroom with the infected person. If you have no choice, WHO advises that taps, doorknobs, and other items are cleaned regularly with soap and water.\n\n4. Household members will have to always wear a face mask and maintain 1 \u2013 2 meters of physical distance from the patient\n\nYes, if you are positive and choose to quarantine at home, your other household members will have to constantly wear a face mask while at home.

Sure, maybe instant noodles or spaghetti might be simple enough to whip up, but Malaysians need good \u2018ol Malaysian food to keep ourselves happy.\n\nBut Malaysian food, such as sambal belacan, is notoriously labourous and difficult, and you have no real cooking experience\u2026 is it possible?\n\nActually, the answer is yes. If someone else has already done all the hard parts of cooking for you.\n\nWe spoke to celebrity chef Sherson Lian, who gave us some tips and tricks on how to make an extremely simple Malaysia\u2019s favourite ikan sambal belacan with almost none of the labour that comes with it.\n\n3-Ingredient Ikan Sambal Belacan\n\nIngredients:\n\nIkan kembung (leatherjacket fish, readily available already cleaned, gutted, and descaled at grocery stores or at the fishmonger\u2019s)\n\nTumeric\n\nSalt\n\nPre-made sambal belacan paste\n\nBanana leaves (optional)\n\nFish, sambal belacan paste, and tumeric. That\u2019s all you need.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\nPreperation:\n\n1) Pat dry the fish. Cut two pockets on both sides along the fish\u2019s spine. (Chef\u2019s note: If you are having trouble with slicing through the flesh, try sharpening your knife. A dull knife can easily cause injuries to yourself.)\n\n2) Give the fish a generous tumeric rub to get rid of its fishy smell, including the insides of the pockets. Then, season it with a little salt.\n\nDo it like salt bae.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\n3) Scoop your sambal belacan paste into the pockets. Be generous with it, but most importantly, use a new clean and dry spoon in between the scoops as you do not want to contaminate the sambal paste.\n\nPockets are meant to be stuffed.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\n4) Heat up a pan to medium-high heat. If you have banana leaves, place it in the pan.\n\n5) Drizzle some oil over the fish. Then, place the fish in the pan.\n\nUse tongs to make it easier to handle the fish.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\n6) Flip the fish and ensure both sides are cooked. (Chef\u2019s note: Ikan kembung has thick skin, so the usual way to check if it\u2019s cooked by poking a fork into the meat won\u2019t work. Instead, check the eyes- they should turn completely white. However, you can leave it to cook a little longer if you\u2019re not sure as this fish is very forgiving to being overcooked.)\n\n7) Serve with rice and enjoy.\n\nA hot, piping meal is ready, all from the comfort of your own home.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\nSherson notes that sambal belacan is one of those sides that goes well with everything and every family has their own secret recipe. Still, it\u2019s a great beginner paste, and you can easily modify the recipe or use different kinds of protein to pair with the sambal belacan.\n\nIf you put the ikan sambal belacan on a fresh piece of bana leaf with some ceylon as garnish, you could even impress a date!\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\nThe one used here is from Sherson\u2019s line of Rencah pastes and condiments and is also used in his restaurants. The chili seeds are blended directly into the paste for a smoother taste and he adds thinly sliced calamansi skin for an extra hint of texture and fragrance.\n\nBut this recipe will work with any pre-prepared sambal belacan paste, you won\u2019t need to spend 4 hours making it from scratch.\n\nPS: Fish not quite your thing?

Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) will be spending RM200 million for the distribution of essential items, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and community drumming programme for rural areas this year.\n\nThe ministry has identified 137 new distribution areas, including islands such as Pulau Tioman, Pulau Perhentian and Pulau Redang in Terengganu and Pahang.\n\nThe ministry said several new areas in Sabah and Sarawak have also been identified for the programme.\n\n\u201cFor 2021, the government has approved an allocation of RM200 million for the programme, which is an increase of RM50 million or 33% compared to last year\u2019s RM150 million.\n\n\u201cThe increment in the allocation allows the ministry to expand the distribution to new areas in need,\u201d it said in a statement yesterday.\n\nFrom its observation, KPDNHEP said people who are living in rural areas have to pay higher prices for essential goods compared to people living in urban areas due to the additional transportation cost.\n\n\u201cIt is due to the high cost of transportation as logistics providers have to travel a long distance to remote areas and through difficult roads, such as logging roads, rivers and rapids,\u201d the ministry said.\n\nIt added that poor connection among infrastructure facilities and various terrain structures such as hills, mountains and islands also contribute to the high transportation costs.\n\nThe programme, which started in 2009, has managed to help the rural community have better access to basic goods like rice, sugar, flour, cooking oil, LPG, RON95 petrol and diesel at controlled prices.\n\n\u201cDistribution of the necessities is carried out by appointed transporters, who buy from trusted suppliers in the city, and send and sell the items to point of

The implementation of halal certification is governed by the Trade Description Act and Orders related thereto.\n\nThe Act empowers Jakim as a competent authority in the issuance of the halal logo. This is rightly so, as an authority is required to guarantee that the products are genuinely halal in compliance with the Shariah principles. However, Jakim can only carry out inspections to ensure compliance. Any infringement may only result in the withdrawal of Jakim halal certificate. Jakim cannot exercise enforcement power, as the main player under the Act is the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP), while Jakim merely testifies as witnesses.\n\nFurthermore, the law does not impose an obligation that all foods are marked halal. Traders and manufacturers apply for certification voluntarily. If they choose not to apply but opt to forge certification, certainly Jakim could hardly be blamed. In the same way we do not blame Bank Negara for the forged currency floating, so too can we blame Jakim for the forged halal certification. Apart from KPDNHEP, the blame equally lies on the Customs, Royal Malaysia Police and local authorities who have halal execution power in their by-laws.\n\nThe consumption of halal food is a fundamental right of Muslims under the Constitution, yet as of today, our right to get halal food is not strictly guaranteed. The Malay Consultative Council should work towards that direction, rather than admonish a Muslim authority, albeit Jakim.\n\nOne unfortunate shortcoming of Jakim was their delayed reaction in \u201csetting the record straight\u201d.

This time, the public is robbed of safe, genuine, quality and, to the Muslims, halal meat \u2014 a betrayal in all dimensions to consumers.\n\nThe case begs the question as to why it was left unchecked for such a long time. Logically, it means that it must have been well planned, tested and proven, or that the system is so weak that it failed to prevent such a serious situation.\n\nLet us look at the industry landscape that allows such a practice to breed. In 2018, the self-sufficiency level for meat stood at 22%, where the consumption per capita was 6.3kg per year, import value was RM3.8 billion and export value was RM1.2 billion, giving a trade deficit of RM2.6 billion. Similarly, related commodities such as milk and feedstock experienced a deficit of RM2.6 billion and RM10.2 billion respectively in 2018.\n\nThe data implies that, first, the demand for meat and milk is far greater than local supply, which has shown slow growth in the last five decades. Second, Malaysia depends on imported feedstock for her cows.\n\nThe agencies involved in monitoring the sector include the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP), Department of Veterinary Services (DVS), Jabatan Kemajuan Islam Malaysia (Jakim), Malaysian Quarantine and Inspection Services (Maqis), Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), the Royal Malaysian Customs Department (RMCD) and Port Police (PP).\n\nIn simple terms, the cartel uses fake halal certificates for meat from uncertified sources from the point of slaughter, either at the exporting country or at local warehouses, until it reaches consumers. The activities involved are acquisition, storing, processing, smuggling, manipulation, abetting and bringing into the country the non-certified frozen meat through approved import permits.\n\nThe real modus operandi involves a web of collaborative work of the cartel, suppliers, officials and traders both overseas and on the domestic scene. It is alleged that the first point of faking halal certificates may occur at slaughterhouses overseas, which have to get halal certification under the purview of Jakim and DVS. Once the cartel bypasses the first stage of inspection, the rest of the procedures are less of a hurdle.\n\nOnce the meat reaches the ports, the cartel again could move in smoothly with the help of \u201crepresentatives\u201d of very senior officials from government agencies working with it. Upon reaching the warehouses, the meat would be mixed with halal-certified meat and repacked with fake halal logos, then released to the market.\n\nThe supporting structure under which this malpractice takes place is described as follows.\n\nFirst, Malaysia is continuously dependent on meat imports (particularly beef and lamb), owing largely to growing demand, while local production shows the reverse trend. Local production is weak because of low productivity, high cost of production and inefficient small farms. These result in inflows of meat from efficient producers such as Australia, New Zealand and Argentina at relatively lower prices than local sources.\n\nSecond, arbitrage activities thrive when there is a big price gap between two locations. For instance, there are 124 illegal jetties in Kelantan where the black market or smuggling of goods and food commodities has been active for many decades. This occurs because the prices in Thailand are cheaper than in Malaysia. A similar analogy applies in the case of meat imports.\n\nThird, standards, sanitary and phytosanitary requirements and halal certification involve costs and disruption. As such, barriers \u2014 especially those that are messy and costly \u2014 incentivise traders to avoid or bypass the rules wherever possible. Some go to the extreme by violating the law and regulations, especially if the monitoring procedures are weak and ineffective.\n\nFourth, the import industry is oligopolistic in nature, where collusion among members is rampant, as proven in this case.\n\nFifth, it is highly probable that lowly paid government servants are drawn to receive bribes, especially when governance is weak, as proven by the alleged abuse that is said to have occurred for 40 years.\n\nSixth, with six agencies involved in monitoring meat imports, it is highly probable that there exists a redundancy of functions that deter efficiency. Seventh, non-governmental organisations and consumers that have the power to bring about change failed to sound the warning bell.\n\nThe convergence of these factors has led to the scandal being untouched by the law.\n\nWhat are the policy implications? Since this practice has taken root over a long time, no quick solution will undo it. While legal proceedings are a must, medium- and long-term structural changes must be instituted immediately.\n\nFirst, there is an urgent need for a deep inquiry into this matter in terms of the gap between standard operating procedures and reality, the major players that are responsible, the weakest links in the supply chain, the governance structure and the role of public agencies.\n\nSecond, there is an urgent need to increase local production through improvement in productivity and cost reduction. The livestock producers must be empowered with skills, knowledge and advanced technologies to improve production. Production cost can be reduced by using local materials such as palm kernel cake and other sources.\n\nThird, the farmers\u2019 cooperatives have to be strengthened to improve domestic production. Small farms find it hard to sustain production, owing to limited capital for investment but, through this vehicle, they may share resources and gain economies of scale.\n\nFourth, the National Feedlot Centre is not feasible, as it is highly centralised and has proved to be vulnerable to rent-seeking practices in the past. It can be replaced by support measures and incentives to encourage private abattoirs that are more competitive, run either by individuals or cooperatives.\n\nFifth, the cartel can be diffused by competition. The import sector should be opened up to more participants so that market control or any predatory move is checked by the competing participants.\n\nSixth, the data speaks the truth. Digitalisation of the supply chain may provide transactional transparency to all participants, hence minimising malpractices. Among the applications are blockchain, an information and communications technology solution whose distributed ledger technology allows data to be stored on servers. It creates secure, real-time communication networks with partners along the supply chain. The system makes it difficult for one user to gain control of, or game, the network.\n\nMaybe Malaysia is not ready for this, but the concept is of high utility. For a start, the country should focus on developing a complete database of who is doing what as well as their business profile. Data to be monitored is all the players\u2019 profiles, including overseas slaughter houses, in terms of production, quantity and quality traded, price, origin or source of meat, and prices. From the data one can detect irregularities such as a sudden increase in quantity or changes in prices or sources of origin. Such tracking may minimise malpractices along the supply chain. Once these databases are running well, then more sophisticated transaction apps such as blockchain may be considered.\n\nIn short, the issue of fake halal certificates is just a symptom of a deeper structural disease. This refers to a non-transparent procurement system, weak governance, oligopolistic import market and too many agencies involved, resulting in fragmented monitoring and attractive arbitrage opportunities, owing to low domestic production. It mirrors a systemic failure that requires a system overhaul.\n\nProf Datin Paduka Fatimah Mohamed Arshad is head of the agriculture and food security cluster at the Academy of Professors Malaysia.

optical shops, boutiques, sports and recreational activities (except for jogging limited to two persons from the same household and cycling), mass gatherings, tourism activities, tuition classes,

Baru and See had betrayed the party by leaving PKR early last year and the departure of Baru had contributed to the downfall of the Pakatan Harapan (PH) federal government at the time.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference at the PKR Kuching and Stampin Branch office at Jalan Sin Sin Park here today, Ng admitted the state PKR had been weakened following the departure of the duo.\n\n\u201cHowever, it only makes us more determined to come back especially in the seats that these people won under PKR. The party is weakened, no doubt, but we will rise again in debacle.\n\n\u201cThey betrayed not only the party but contributed to the downfall of PH. We call them traitors. The party must learn from the setback,\u201d said the former Padungan assemblyman who served from 2006 to 2011.\n\nBaru and See contested and won in the 2016 state polls under the ticket of PKR, but they joined PSB late May last year, after being sacked by PKR following the collapse of the PH government.

Some even said PKR expelled them. It is best for Baru to explain to the public whether he was expelled or he left the party.\n\n\u201cHe should explain to the people, and not keeping quiet,\u201d he said, with Ng adding: \u201cOh, he described himself as a \u2018clever frog\u2019.\u201d\n\nJoshua, who has been with PKR since 2009, said Baru was not thrown out by the party.

for a policy to address birds\u2019 nests on electricity pylons or telecommunication towers.\n\nIn a statement today, MNS Terengganu said it was informed of an active white-bellied sea eagle nest on a telecommunication tower in Merang, Terengganu, which had newly-laid eggs but was \u201cdestroyed\u201d by the tower operators.\n\nThe eagles are classified as a totally protected species under the Wildlife Conservation Act 2010.\n\n\u201cThis is against the Wildlife Conservation Act 2010.\n\n\u201cRather than wait a few months for the family of eagles to raise their young, their future was abruptly terminated,\u201d MNS Terengganu chairman Wong Chee Ho said.\n\nNoting that the country currently lacks any policies on how to deal with nests on towers, Wong proposed a meeting with power company operators in Terengganu, as well as the telecommunication companies that use such towers, to formulate a statewide solution which would be the first for the country.\n\n\u201cWe want to create a new policy to better manage this problem in a way that protects wildlife and ensures the safety of all, including meeting the needs of the corporations and the services they provide.\n\n\u201cThe costs of monitoring all towers and keeping them nest-free is much more than the cost of supporting new and innovative ways of learning to live with the birds,\u201d he said.\n\nWong noted that while many eagles have traditionally constructed their nests on tall trees, more of them are using man-made structures instead.\n\nApart from being taller than many of the surrounding trees and giving birds of prey a better vantage point to survey their territory, such structures are also sturdy and able to support large nests.\n\nWith the expansion of electricity distribution over the past century, and the more recent surge in telecommunication towers, more birds are choosing man-made structures to build their nests.\n\nHowever, nesting birds are known to have disrupted electricity and telecommunication services provided through the towers, while nests made of dry wood and grass can cause fires which lead to service loss for the public and expensive repairs for the companies involved.\n\nPointing out that birds like the white-bellied sea eagle are territorial, Wong said once they have selected a site to nest, they will return to it year after year and rebuild even if their nests are removed.\n\nWhile he admitted some nests will have to be removed as they pose a threat to the company and the birds themselves, Wong stressed the need for a policy on nest removal that does not destroy wildlife.\n\n\u201cPower and telecommunication companies need to explore other ways to resolve this conflict,\u201d he said, suggesting a few solutions that could be incorporated.\n\n\u201cOne solution could be adding a platform to the towers, placed in a safe location, and made suitable for birds of prey to use as nesting platforms.\n\n\u201cCameras could be installed to record video of the nesting birds. This video could be shared as a live feed to generate interest among the public and showcase conservation activities of the corporations involved.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["nesting", "terengganu", "towers", "structures", "wildlife", "policy", "birds", "regrets", "eagles", "telecommunication", "nature", "nests", "removal", "rare", "telco", "nest", "group", "tower"], "summary": "PETALING JAYA: The Malaysian Nature Society (MNS) has called for a policy to address birds\u2019 nests on electricity pylons or telecommunication towers.\nIn a statement today, MNS Terengganu said it was informed of an active white-bellied sea eagle nest on a telecommunication tower in Merang, Terengganu, which had newly-laid eggs but was \u201cdestroyed\u201d by the tower operators.\nThe eagles are classified as a totally protected species under the Wildlife Conservation Act 2010.\nWong noted that while many eagles have traditionally constructed their nests on tall trees, more of them are using man-made structures instead.\n\u201cCameras could be installed to record video of the nesting birds.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-01-11 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Here\u2019s MOH\u2019s Home Quarantine Guideline For Asymptomatic Covid-19 Patients", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wMS8xMC9oZXJlcy1tb2hzLWhvbWUtcXVhcmFudGluZS1ndWlkZWxpbmUtZm9yLWFzeW1wdG9tYXRpYy1jb3ZpZC0xOS1wYXRpZW50cy_SAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlcmFreWF0cG9zdC5jb20vbmV3cy9tYWxheXNpYS8yMDIxLzAxLzEwL2hlcmVzLW1vaHMtaG9tZS1xdWFyYW50aW5lLWd1aWRlbGluZS1mb3ItYXN5bXB0b21hdGljLWNvdmlkLTE5LXBhdGllbnRzL2FtcC8?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Tasneem Nazari", "Maya Suraya", "Azizul Rahman Ismail"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Feature-Image_quarantine.jpg", "text": "Subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates.\n\nIf you\u2019re one of the few lucky ones to have enough space to safely quarantine at home, the Health Ministry recently tweeted a safety guideline for Covid-19 positive patients to undergo their quarantine period in the comfort of their own homes rather than at quarantine centres.\n\nHealth Director-General Tan Sri Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah had previously stated that low risk and asymptomatic patients, known as Category One and Two Cases, are usually placed at Covid-19 quarantine and low-risk treatment centres (PKRC).\n\nHowever, seeing as health facilities are becoming impacted by the constant four-digit increase in new cases daily, the Health Ministry is now considering the possibility of having asymptomatic Covid-19 positive individuals undergo home quarantine, instead.\n\nREAD MORE: Think You Might Be Covid-19 Close Contact? MOH Explains What Happens\n\n1. Get in touch with your district health office\n\nIf you suspect you have contracted the illness, get yourself tested. If you have already tested positive, the Health Ministry\u2019s tweet says that the district health office will contact patients to undergo Covid-19 swab tests.\n\nOnce confirmed positive, they will provide a Monitoring and Observation Order and a quarantine band for positive patients staying at home.\n\n2. The positive patient will need to stay at home for 10 days\n\nQuarantine at home will mean that you won\u2019t be allowed to leave your house for any reason for the period of 10 days.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) also advises that you avoid having visitors over and that they should not interact with the patient under any circumstances.\n\n3. The positive patient should not share a room with any other household members\n\nEven though still at home, you\u2019ll have to separate yourself from the rest of your household to avoid accidentally infecting them. (Credit: Unsplash)\n\nUnless this is possible, home quarantine shouldn\u2019t be your first choice.\n\nA separate room with adequate ventilation should be allocated for the patient. Other household members should stay and sleep in another room and be separated from the patient at all times.\n\nIf possible, other household members should also avoid sharing the same bathroom with the infected person. If you have no choice, WHO advises that taps, doorknobs, and other items are cleaned regularly with soap and water.\n\n4. Household members will have to always wear a face mask and maintain 1 \u2013 2 meters of physical distance from the patient\n\nYes, if you are positive and choose to quarantine at home, your other household members will have to constantly wear a face mask while at home. You must also constantly maintain a physical distance from them to avoid getting them infected as well.\n\n5. Meals, drinks and other essential items should be placed outside the patient\u2019s room door to be taken by themselves\n\nYou and your household members will need to constantly wear a mask while at home during your quarantine period and maintain physical distance from you at all times. (Credit: Unsplash)\n\nPractice contactless delivery when passing food and other essential items to the patient to minimise physical contact between the positive individuals and other members of the household.\n\n6.

Sure, maybe instant noodles or spaghetti might be simple enough to whip up, but Malaysians need good \u2018ol Malaysian food to keep ourselves happy.\n\nBut Malaysian food, such as sambal belacan, is notoriously labourous and difficult, and you have no real cooking experience\u2026 is it possible?\n\nActually, the answer is yes. If someone else has already done all the hard parts of cooking for you.\n\nWe spoke to celebrity chef Sherson Lian, who gave us some tips and tricks on how to make an extremely simple Malaysia\u2019s favourite ikan sambal belacan with almost none of the labour that comes with it.\n\n3-Ingredient Ikan Sambal Belacan\n\nIngredients:\n\nIkan kembung (leatherjacket fish, readily available already cleaned, gutted, and descaled at grocery stores or at the fishmonger\u2019s)\n\nTumeric\n\nSalt\n\nPre-made sambal belacan paste\n\nBanana leaves (optional)\n\nFish, sambal belacan paste, and tumeric. That\u2019s all you need.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\nPreperation:\n\n1) Pat dry the fish. Cut two pockets on both sides along the fish\u2019s spine. (Chef\u2019s note: If you are having trouble with slicing through the flesh, try sharpening your knife. A dull knife can easily cause injuries to yourself.)\n\n2) Give the fish a generous tumeric rub to get rid of its fishy smell, including the insides of the pockets. Then, season it with a little salt.\n\nDo it like salt bae.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\n3) Scoop your sambal belacan paste into the pockets. Be generous with it, but most importantly, use a new clean and dry spoon in between the scoops as you do not want to contaminate the sambal paste.\n\nPockets are meant to be stuffed.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\n4) Heat up a pan to medium-high heat. If you have banana leaves, place it in the pan.\n\n5) Drizzle some oil over the fish. Then, place the fish in the pan.\n\nUse tongs to make it easier to handle the fish.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\n6) Flip the fish and ensure both sides are cooked. (Chef\u2019s note: Ikan kembung has thick skin, so the usual way to check if it\u2019s cooked by poking a fork into the meat won\u2019t work. Instead, check the eyes- they should turn completely white. However, you can leave it to cook a little longer if you\u2019re not sure as this fish is very forgiving to being overcooked.)\n\n7) Serve with rice and enjoy.\n\nA hot, piping meal is ready, all from the comfort of your own home.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\nSherson notes that sambal belacan is one of those sides that goes well with everything and every family has their own secret recipe. Still, it\u2019s a great beginner paste, and you can easily modify the recipe or use different kinds of protein to pair with the sambal belacan.\n\nIf you put the ikan sambal belacan on a fresh piece of bana leaf with some ceylon as garnish, you could even impress a date!\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\nThe one used here is from Sherson\u2019s line of Rencah pastes and condiments and is also used in his restaurants. The chili seeds are blended directly into the paste for a smoother taste and he adds thinly sliced calamansi skin for an extra hint of texture and fragrance.\n\nBut this recipe will work with any pre-prepared sambal belacan paste, you won\u2019t need to spend 4 hours making it from scratch.\n\nPS: Fish not quite your thing?

Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) will be spending RM200 million for the distribution of essential items, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and community drumming programme for rural areas this year.\n\nThe ministry has identified 137 new distribution areas, including islands such as Pulau Tioman, Pulau Perhentian and Pulau Redang in Terengganu and Pahang.\n\nThe ministry said several new areas in Sabah and Sarawak have also been identified for the programme.\n\n\u201cFor 2021, the government has approved an allocation of RM200 million for the programme, which is an increase of RM50 million or 33% compared to last year\u2019s RM150 million.\n\n\u201cThe increment in the allocation allows the ministry to expand the distribution to new areas in need,\u201d it said in a statement yesterday.\n\nFrom its observation, KPDNHEP said people who are living in rural areas have to pay higher prices for essential goods compared to people living in urban areas due to the additional transportation cost.\n\n\u201cIt is due to the high cost of transportation as logistics providers have to travel a long distance to remote areas and through difficult roads, such as logging roads, rivers and rapids,\u201d the ministry said.\n\nIt added that poor connection among infrastructure facilities and various terrain structures such as hills, mountains and islands also contribute to the high transportation costs.\n\nThe programme, which started in 2009, has managed to help the rural community have better access to basic goods like rice, sugar, flour, cooking oil, LPG, RON95 petrol and diesel at controlled prices.\n\n\u201cDistribution of the necessities is carried out by appointed transporters, who buy from trusted suppliers in the city, and send and sell the items to point of

The implementation of halal certification is governed by the Trade Description Act and Orders related thereto.\n\nThe Act empowers Jakim as a competent authority in the issuance of the halal logo. This is rightly so, as an authority is required to guarantee that the products are genuinely halal in compliance with the Shariah principles. However, Jakim can only carry out inspections to ensure compliance. Any infringement may only result in the withdrawal of Jakim halal certificate. Jakim cannot exercise enforcement power, as the main player under the Act is the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP), while Jakim merely testifies as witnesses.\n\nFurthermore, the law does not impose an obligation that all foods are marked halal. Traders and manufacturers apply for certification voluntarily. If they choose not to apply but opt to forge certification, certainly Jakim could hardly be blamed. In the same way we do not blame Bank Negara for the forged currency floating, so too can we blame Jakim for the forged halal certification. Apart from KPDNHEP, the blame equally lies on the Customs, Royal Malaysia Police and local authorities who have halal execution power in their by-laws.\n\nThe consumption of halal food is a fundamental right of Muslims under the Constitution, yet as of today, our right to get halal food is not strictly guaranteed. The Malay Consultative Council should work towards that direction, rather than admonish a Muslim authority, albeit Jakim.\n\nOne unfortunate shortcoming of Jakim was their delayed reaction in \u201csetting the record straight\u201d.

This time, the public is robbed of safe, genuine, quality and, to the Muslims, halal meat \u2014 a betrayal in all dimensions to consumers.\n\nThe case begs the question as to why it was left unchecked for such a long time. Logically, it means that it must have been well planned, tested and proven, or that the system is so weak that it failed to prevent such a serious situation.\n\nLet us look at the industry landscape that allows such a practice to breed. In 2018, the self-sufficiency level for meat stood at 22%, where the consumption per capita was 6.3kg per year, import value was RM3.8 billion and export value was RM1.2 billion, giving a trade deficit of RM2.6 billion. Similarly, related commodities such as milk and feedstock experienced a deficit of RM2.6 billion and RM10.2 billion respectively in 2018.\n\nThe data implies that, first, the demand for meat and milk is far greater than local supply, which has shown slow growth in the last five decades. Second, Malaysia depends on imported feedstock for her cows.\n\nThe agencies involved in monitoring the sector include the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP), Department of Veterinary Services (DVS), Jabatan Kemajuan Islam Malaysia (Jakim), Malaysian Quarantine and Inspection Services (Maqis), Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), the Royal Malaysian Customs Department (RMCD) and Port Police (PP).\n\nIn simple terms, the cartel uses fake halal certificates for meat from uncertified sources from the point of slaughter, either at the exporting country or at local warehouses, until it reaches consumers. The activities involved are acquisition, storing, processing, smuggling, manipulation, abetting and bringing into the country the non-certified frozen meat through approved import permits.\n\nThe real modus operandi involves a web of collaborative work of the cartel, suppliers, officials and traders both overseas and on the domestic scene. It is alleged that the first point of faking halal certificates may occur at slaughterhouses overseas, which have to get halal certification under the purview of Jakim and DVS. Once the cartel bypasses the first stage of inspection, the rest of the procedures are less of a hurdle.\n\nOnce the meat reaches the ports, the cartel again could move in smoothly with the help of \u201crepresentatives\u201d of very senior officials from government agencies working with it. Upon reaching the warehouses, the meat would be mixed with halal-certified meat and repacked with fake halal logos, then released to the market.\n\nThe supporting structure under which this malpractice takes place is described as follows.\n\nFirst, Malaysia is continuously dependent on meat imports (particularly beef and lamb), owing largely to growing demand, while local production shows the reverse trend. Local production is weak because of low productivity, high cost of production and inefficient small farms. These result in inflows of meat from efficient producers such as Australia, New Zealand and Argentina at relatively lower prices than local sources.\n\nSecond, arbitrage activities thrive when there is a big price gap between two locations. For instance, there are 124 illegal jetties in Kelantan where the black market or smuggling of goods and food commodities has been active for many decades. This occurs because the prices in Thailand are cheaper than in Malaysia. A similar analogy applies in the case of meat imports.\n\nThird, standards, sanitary and phytosanitary requirements and halal certification involve costs and disruption. As such, barriers \u2014 especially those that are messy and costly \u2014 incentivise traders to avoid or bypass the rules wherever possible. Some go to the extreme by violating the law and regulations, especially if the monitoring procedures are weak and ineffective.\n\nFourth, the import industry is oligopolistic in nature, where collusion among members is rampant, as proven in this case.\n\nFifth, it is highly probable that lowly paid government servants are drawn to receive bribes, especially when governance is weak, as proven by the alleged abuse that is said to have occurred for 40 years.\n\nSixth, with six agencies involved in monitoring meat imports, it is highly probable that there exists a redundancy of functions that deter efficiency. Seventh, non-governmental organisations and consumers that have the power to bring about change failed to sound the warning bell.\n\nThe convergence of these factors has led to the scandal being untouched by the law.\n\nWhat are the policy implications? Since this practice has taken root over a long time, no quick solution will undo it. While legal proceedings are a must, medium- and long-term structural changes must be instituted immediately.\n\nFirst, there is an urgent need for a deep inquiry into this matter in terms of the gap between standard operating procedures and reality, the major players that are responsible, the weakest links in the supply chain, the governance structure and the role of public agencies.\n\nSecond, there is an urgent need to increase local production through improvement in productivity and cost reduction. The livestock producers must be empowered with skills, knowledge and advanced technologies to improve production. Production cost can be reduced by using local materials such as palm kernel cake and other sources.\n\nThird, the farmers\u2019 cooperatives have to be strengthened to improve domestic production. Small farms find it hard to sustain production, owing to limited capital for investment but, through this vehicle, they may share resources and gain economies of scale.\n\nFourth, the National Feedlot Centre is not feasible, as it is highly centralised and has proved to be vulnerable to rent-seeking practices in the past. It can be replaced by support measures and incentives to encourage private abattoirs that are more competitive, run either by individuals or cooperatives.\n\nFifth, the cartel can be diffused by competition. The import sector should be opened up to more participants so that market control or any predatory move is checked by the competing participants.\n\nSixth, the data speaks the truth. Digitalisation of the supply chain may provide transactional transparency to all participants, hence minimising malpractices. Among the applications are blockchain, an information and communications technology solution whose distributed ledger technology allows data to be stored on servers. It creates secure, real-time communication networks with partners along the supply chain. The system makes it difficult for one user to gain control of, or game, the network.\n\nMaybe Malaysia is not ready for this, but the concept is of high utility. For a start, the country should focus on developing a complete database of who is doing what as well as their business profile. Data to be monitored is all the players\u2019 profiles, including overseas slaughter houses, in terms of production, quantity and quality traded, price, origin or source of meat, and prices. From the data one can detect irregularities such as a sudden increase in quantity or changes in prices or sources of origin. Such tracking may minimise malpractices along the supply chain. Once these databases are running well, then more sophisticated transaction apps such as blockchain may be considered.\n\nIn short, the issue of fake halal certificates is just a symptom of a deeper structural disease. This refers to a non-transparent procurement system, weak governance, oligopolistic import market and too many agencies involved, resulting in fragmented monitoring and attractive arbitrage opportunities, owing to low domestic production. It mirrors a systemic failure that requires a system overhaul.\n\nProf Datin Paduka Fatimah Mohamed Arshad is head of the agriculture and food security cluster at the Academy of Professors Malaysia.

optical shops, boutiques, sports and recreational activities (except for jogging limited to two persons from the same household and cycling), mass gatherings, tourism activities, tuition classes,

Baru and See had betrayed the party by leaving PKR early last year and the departure of Baru had contributed to the downfall of the Pakatan Harapan (PH) federal government at the time.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference at the PKR Kuching and Stampin Branch office at Jalan Sin Sin Park here today, Ng admitted the state PKR had been weakened following the departure of the duo.\n\n\u201cHowever, it

The party must learn from the setback,\u201d said the former Padungan assemblyman who served from 2006 to 2011.\n\nBaru and See contested and won in the 2016 state polls under the ticket of PKR, but they joined PSB late May last year, after being sacked by PKR following the collapse of the PH government.

for a policy to address birds\u2019 nests on electricity pylons or telecommunication towers.\n\nIn a statement today, MNS Terengganu said it was informed of an active white-bellied sea eagle nest on a telecommunication tower in Merang, Terengganu, which had newly-laid eggs but was \u201cdestroyed\u201d by the tower operators.\n\nThe eagles are classified as a totally protected species under the Wildlife Conservation Act 2010.\n\n\u201cThis is against the Wildlife Conservation Act 2010.\n\n\u201cRather than wait a few months for the family of eagles to raise their young, their future was abruptly terminated,\u201d MNS Terengganu chairman Wong Chee Ho said.\n\nNoting that the country currently lacks any policies on how to deal with nests on towers, Wong proposed a meeting with power company operators in Terengganu, as well as the telecommunication companies that use such towers, to formulate a statewide solution which would be the first for the country.\n\n\u201cWe want to create a new policy to better manage this problem in a way that protects wildlife and ensures the safety of all, including meeting the needs of the corporations and the services they provide.\n\n\u201cThe costs of monitoring all towers and keeping them nest-free is much more than the cost of supporting new and innovative ways of learning to live with the birds,\u201d he said.\n\nWong noted that while many eagles have traditionally constructed their nests on tall trees, more of them are using man-made structures instead.\n\nApart from being taller than many of the surrounding trees and giving birds of prey a better vantage point to survey their territory, such structures are also sturdy and able to support large nests.\n\nWith the expansion of electricity distribution over the past century, and the more recent surge in telecommunication towers, more birds are choosing man-made structures to build their nests.\n\nHowever, nesting birds are known to have disrupted electricity and telecommunication services provided through the towers, while nests made of dry wood and grass can cause fires which lead to service loss for the public and expensive repairs for the companies involved.\n\nPointing out that birds like the white-bellied sea eagle are territorial, Wong said once they have selected a site to nest, they will return to it year after year and rebuild even if their nests are removed.\n\nWhile he admitted some nests will have to be removed as they pose a threat to the company and the birds themselves, Wong stressed the need for a policy on nest removal that does not destroy wildlife.\n\n\u201cPower and telecommunication companies need to explore other ways to resolve this conflict,\u201d he said, suggesting a few solutions that could be incorporated.\n\n\u201cOne solution could be adding a platform to the towers, placed in a safe location, and made suitable for birds of prey to use as nesting platforms.\n\n\u201cCameras could be installed to record video of the nesting birds. This video could be shared as a live feed to generate interest among the public and showcase conservation activities of the corporations involved.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["nesting", "terengganu", "towers", "structures", "wildlife", "policy", "birds", "regrets", "eagles", "telecommunication", "nature", "nests", "removal", "rare", "telco", "nest", "group", "tower"], "summary": "PETALING JAYA: The Malaysian Nature Society (MNS) has called for a policy to address birds\u2019 nests on electricity pylons or telecommunication towers.\nIn a statement today, MNS Terengganu said it was informed of an active white-bellied sea eagle nest on a telecommunication tower in Merang, Terengganu, which had newly-laid eggs but was \u201cdestroyed\u201d by the tower operators.\nThe eagles are classified as a totally protected species under the Wildlife Conservation Act 2010.\nWong noted that while many eagles have traditionally constructed their nests on tall trees, more of them are using man-made structures instead.\n\u201cCameras could be installed to record video of the nesting birds.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-01-11 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Breathing new life into dying art form", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN1bmRhaWx5Lm15L2xvY2FsL2JyZWF0aGluZy1uZXctbGlmZS1pbnRvLWR5aW5nLWFydC1mb3JtLUFGNjA0Mzk5MtIBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://www.thesundaily.my/binrepository/480x320/0c6/480d250/none/11808/NOOF/image-1981530_1983190_20210111114043.jpg", "text": "BACK when the web was what spiders spun and the TV was in black and white, the Chinese opera was the entertainment that drew large crowds.\n\nToday, such performances are staged only occasionally, mostly on significant dates such as the Hungry Ghost Festival.\n\nFor the younger generation, who have unlimited entertainment options thanks to new technology, sitting in the moonlight for a\n\nthree-hour stage retelling of palace intrigue or lost love is no longer as magical.\n\nBut, if Chinese opera enthusiast Daryl Leong, 43, has his way, the lost art may yet get a revival, thanks to technology.\n\nIn Malaysia, the Chinese opera, in various dialects such as Cantonese, Teochew and Hokkien, had its hey day in the 1920s and 1930s,\n\nwhen several troupes travelled across the country to perform for eager fans.\n\nHowever, the number of local troupes eventually dwindled, replaced mostly by those from Thailand, particularly for performances in the Teochew dialect.\n\nAccording to Leong, who is chief secretary of the Yuet Wan Cantonese Opera Association Kuala Lumpur, urbanisation and globalisation also led to a decline, and eventual demise, of the opera.\n\n\u201cMany associations folded up when their opera troupes could not keep up with the times. The Yuet Wan is likely the only group still active in Malaysia,\u201d he told theSun.\n\nLeong lays the blame partly on the failure to instil a love for the art among the younger people.\n\nAs a young man practising an age-old art, he is a rarity. He still dons the full regalia for the occasional performance.\n\nLeong laments the fact that many sifus, or masters of the art form, have not been able to find sufficient interest among the younger generation to whom they can pass on their skills.\n\nOpera, Leong pointed out, is an art form that takes years to learn and even longer to perfect. Another setback is the high cost of the costumes.\n\n\u201cOur costumes cost thousands of ringgit, but we do not earn enough to cover even a fraction of that,\u201d he added.\n\nA three-night performance today would bring barely RM400 to the table. But the destroyer of the opera may yet be its saviour.\n\nLeong is looking to new technology to advance a bold plan \u2013 to give Cantonese opera a revival. He has assembled a troupe of 10 young social media wizards to advance his plan.\n\n\u201cThe young participants have paved more paths for better exposure of Cantonese opera through Facebook and Instagram,\u201d he said.\n\nMany challenges remain.\n\n\u201cFor instance, there are not enough musically-talented people who are interested in opera,\u201d he said.\n\nLeong, who has been pursuing his love for the art with the association since 2016, said the immediate priority is to find a new set of talents who can play traditional Chinese musical instruments.\n\n\u201cWe strive for authenticity so we don\u2019t use pre-recorded music for our shows.

MOH Explains What Happens\n\n1. Get in touch with your district health office\n\nIf you suspect you have contracted the illness, get yourself tested. If you have already tested positive, the Health Ministry\u2019s tweet says that the district health office will contact patients to undergo Covid-19 swab tests.\n\nOnce confirmed positive, they will provide a Monitoring and Observation Order and a quarantine band for positive patients staying at home.\n\n2. The positive patient will need to stay at home for 10 days\n\nQuarantine at home will mean that you won\u2019t be allowed to leave your house for any reason for the period of 10 days.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) also advises that you avoid having visitors over and that they should not interact with the patient under any circumstances.\n\n3. The positive patient should not share a room with any other household members\n\nEven though still at home, you\u2019ll have to separate yourself from the rest of your household to avoid accidentally infecting them. (Credit: Unsplash)\n\nUnless this is possible, home quarantine shouldn\u2019t be your first choice.\n\nA separate room with adequate ventilation should be allocated for the patient. Other household members should stay and sleep in another room and be separated from the patient at all times.\n\nIf possible, other household members should also avoid sharing the same bathroom with the infected person. If you have no choice, WHO advises that taps, doorknobs, and other items are cleaned regularly with soap and water.\n\n4. Household members will have to always wear a face mask and maintain 1 \u2013 2 meters of physical distance from the patient\n\nYes, if you are positive and choose to quarantine at home, your other household members will have to constantly wear a face mask while at home. You must also constantly maintain a physical distance from them to avoid getting them infected as well.\n\n5. Meals, drinks and other essential items should be placed outside the patient\u2019s room door to be taken by themselves\n\nYou and your household members will need to constantly wear a mask while at home during your quarantine period and maintain physical distance from you at all times. (Credit: Unsplash)\n\nPractice contactless delivery when passing food and other essential items to the patient to minimise physical contact between the positive individuals and other members of the household.\n\n6. Other household members will need to wear gloves when handling items used by the positive patient.\n\nWhen handling items used by the infected individual, such as plates, cups, and eating utensils, household members will need to wear disposable gloves.\n\nAfter use, the gloves should be properly discarded without reuse, preferably in a closed container.\n\nWHO advises that separate dishes, cups, eating utensils, bedding, towels, and other essential items be assigned for the infected person.\n\nBeddings, towels, and clothes used by the infected person should be washed with soap and water separately from those used by the rest of the household.\n\n7. The positive patient and other household members should wash their hands with soap and water or use hand sanitiser as frequently as possible.\n\nFrequently washing your hands will reduce the chances of your household members contracting the infection from you.\n\nWash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds at a time and use alcohol-based hand sanitiser when you don\u2019t have the immediate option of using water and soap.\n\nHousehold members should also avoid touching their eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.\n\n8. The positive asymptomatic patient should monitor themselves for Covid-19 symptoms and update these on the MySejahtera app.\n\nMonitor your body temperature every day using a thermometer, and if you develop any flu-like symptoms, such as a fever, cough, difficulty breathing, sore throat, or body aches and pain, update these on the MySejahtera app.\n\nCheck out the Health Ministry\u2019s tweet on the matter below:\n\nJika anda tinggal serumah dengan kes positif #COVID19 yang memilih untuk menjalani kuarantin di rumah, ini langkah-langkah pencegahan yang WAJIB anda lakukan. pic.twitter.com/lufnK03pYN \u2014 KKMalaysia\ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\uddfe (@KKMPutrajaya) January 8, 2021\n\nShare your thoughts with us via TRP\u2019s Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.", "keyword": ["wear", "patients", "quarantine", "heres", "guideline", "positive", "items", "asymptomatic", "mohs", "patient", "covid19", "health", "members", "household"], "summary": "If you\u2019re one of the few lucky ones to have enough space to safely quarantine at home, the Health Ministry recently tweeted a safety guideline for Covid-19 positive patients to undergo their quarantine period in the comfort of their own homes rather than at quarantine centres.\nOnce confirmed positive, they will provide a Monitoring and Observation Order and a quarantine band for positive patients staying at home.\nIf possible, other household members should also avoid sharing the same bathroom with the infected person.\nThe positive patient and other household members should wash their hands with soap and water or use hand sanitiser as frequently as possible.\nFrequently washing your hands will reduce the chances of your household members contracting the infection from you.", "news": "The Rakyat Post", "date": "2021-01-10 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "The yau char kwai man with a gun", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wMS8xMy90aGUteWF3LWNoYXIta3dhaS1tYW4td2l0aC1hLWd1bi_SAQA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/yau-char-kwai-n-sig-sauer-pistol-collage-130121-2.jpg", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: By day, he was selling the fried pastry cakoi or yau char kwai, which translates into oil-fried devil.

Sure, maybe instant noodles or spaghetti might be simple enough to whip up, but Malaysians need good \u2018ol Malaysian food to keep ourselves happy.\n\nBut Malaysian food, such as sambal belacan, is notoriously labourous and difficult, and you have no real cooking experience\u2026 is it possible?\n\nActually, the answer is yes. If someone else has already done all the hard parts of cooking for you.\n\nWe spoke to celebrity chef Sherson Lian, who gave us some tips and tricks on how to make an extremely simple Malaysia\u2019s favourite ikan sambal belacan with almost none of the labour that comes with it.\n\n3-Ingredient Ikan Sambal Belacan\n\nIngredients:\n\nIkan kembung (leatherjacket fish, readily available already cleaned, gutted, and descaled at grocery stores or at the fishmonger\u2019s)\n\nTumeric\n\nSalt\n\nPre-made sambal belacan paste\n\nBanana leaves (optional)\n\nFish, sambal belacan paste, and tumeric. That\u2019s all you need.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\nPreperation:\n\n1) Pat dry the fish. Cut two pockets on both sides along the fish\u2019s spine. (Chef\u2019s note: If you are having trouble with slicing through the flesh, try sharpening your knife. A dull knife can easily cause injuries to yourself.)\n\n2) Give the fish a generous tumeric rub to get rid of its fishy smell, including the insides of the pockets. Then, season it with a little salt.\n\nDo it like salt bae.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\n3) Scoop your sambal belacan paste into the pockets. Be generous with it, but most importantly, use a new clean and dry spoon in between the scoops as you do not want to contaminate the sambal paste.\n\nPockets are meant to be stuffed.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\n4) Heat up a pan to medium-high heat. If you have banana leaves, place it in the pan.\n\n5) Drizzle some oil over the fish. Then, place the fish in the pan.\n\nUse tongs to make it easier to handle the fish.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\n6) Flip the fish and ensure both sides are cooked. (Chef\u2019s note: Ikan kembung has thick skin, so the usual way to check if it\u2019s cooked by poking a fork into the meat won\u2019t work. Instead, check the eyes- they should turn completely white. However, you can leave it to cook a little longer if you\u2019re not sure as this fish is very forgiving to being overcooked.)\n\n7) Serve with rice and enjoy.\n\nA hot, piping meal is ready, all from the comfort of your own home.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\nSherson notes that sambal belacan is one of those sides that goes well with everything and every family has their own secret recipe. Still, it\u2019s a great beginner paste, and you can easily modify the recipe or use different kinds of protein to pair with the sambal belacan.\n\nIf you put the ikan sambal belacan on a fresh piece of bana leaf with some ceylon as garnish, you could even impress a date!\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\nThe one used here is from Sherson\u2019s line of Rencah pastes and condiments and is also used in his restaurants. The chili seeds are blended directly into the paste for a smoother taste and he adds thinly sliced calamansi skin for an extra hint of texture and fragrance.\n\nBut this recipe will work with any pre-prepared sambal belacan paste, you won\u2019t need to spend 4 hours making it from scratch.\n\nPS: Fish not quite your thing?

The implementation of halal certification is governed by the Trade Description Act and Orders related thereto.\n\nThe Act empowers Jakim as a competent authority in the issuance of the halal logo. This is rightly so, as an authority is required to guarantee that the products are genuinely halal in compliance with the Shariah principles. However, Jakim can only carry out inspections to ensure compliance. Any infringement may only result in the withdrawal of Jakim halal certificate. Jakim cannot exercise enforcement power, as the main player under the Act is the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP), while Jakim merely testifies as witnesses.\n\nFurthermore, the law does not impose an obligation that all foods are marked halal. Traders and manufacturers apply for certification voluntarily. If they choose not to apply but opt to forge certification, certainly Jakim could hardly be blamed. In the same way we do not blame Bank Negara for the forged currency floating, so too can we blame Jakim for the forged halal certification. Apart from KPDNHEP, the blame equally lies on the Customs, Royal Malaysia Police and local authorities who have halal execution power in their by-laws.\n\nThe consumption of halal food is a fundamental right of Muslims under the Constitution, yet as of today, our right to get halal food is not strictly guaranteed. The Malay Consultative Council should work towards that direction, rather than admonish a Muslim authority, albeit Jakim.\n\nOne unfortunate shortcoming of Jakim was their delayed reaction in \u201csetting the record straight\u201d. Unfortunately, the world is now \u201cforced\u201d to deal with the \u201cgame of perception\u201d. Keeping quiet, delayed response or failure to anticipate and manage negative perceptions may be at any organisation\u2019s detriment.\n\nThis is not the first time Jakim has been put under scrutiny for matters which were not directly under their purview. In this case, however, Jakim must understand that the word \u201chalal\u201d in itself will pull them into the \u201cfray\u201d regardless of their involvement.\n\nHence, Jakim should at least invest in effective communication and perception management team which would do them a lot of much-deserved justice.", "keyword": ["halal", "compliance", "authority", "scrutiny", "jakim", "pushing", "stop", "blame", "trade", "certification", "act", "food"], "summary": "The implementation of halal certification is governed by the Trade Description Act and Orders related thereto.\nThe Act empowers Jakim as a competent authority in the issuance of the halal logo.\nAny infringement may only result in the withdrawal of Jakim halal certificate.\nIn the same way we do not blame Bank Negara for the forged currency floating, so too can we blame Jakim for the forged halal certification.\nThe consumption of halal food is a fundamental right of Muslims under the Constitution, yet as of today, our right to get halal food is not strictly guaranteed.", "news": "The Malaysian Reserve", "date": "2021-01-07 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "MCO 2.0: Shopping malls can operate", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEG8IJUQ3Meh3UcdzzUFh9KUqGQgEKhAIACoHCAow9sveCjC0m9YBMPDtoQM?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/pogb18_NSTfield_image_socialmedia.var_1610506085.jpg", "text": "", "keyword": ["shopping", "operate", "malls", "mco", "20"], "summary": "", "news": "New Straits Times", "date": "2021-01-13 00:00:00", "language": "INDONESIA"}, {"title": "My Say: Halal meat fiasco begs a system overhaul", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWVkZ2VtYXJrZXRzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL215LXNheS1oYWxhbC1tZWF0LWZpYXNjby1iZWdzLXN5c3RlbS1vdmVyaGF1bNIBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://assets.theedgemarkets.com/Forum-Daging_20210111181717_theedgemarkets.jpg?KUEcITxU5mqfKqlzdYICPqyH.Bfx47eI", "text": "The imported halal meat fiasco has all the elemental components of a crime: smuggling; faking; a network of cheating syndicates, from the starting point to the consumer table; multinational actors to facilitate multiple functions at multiple points; and unchecked and unpunished, allegedly, for 40 years.\n\nIt is another corruption case that the public has to swallow. This time, the public is robbed of safe, genuine, quality and, to the Muslims, halal meat \u2014 a betrayal in all dimensions to consumers.\n\nThe case begs the question as to why it was left unchecked for such a long time. Logically, it means that it must have been well planned, tested and proven, or that the system is so weak that it failed to prevent such a serious situation.\n\nLet us look at the industry landscape that allows such a practice to breed. In 2018, the self-sufficiency level for meat stood at 22%, where the consumption per capita was 6.3kg per year, import value was RM3.8 billion and export value was RM1.2 billion, giving a trade deficit of RM2.6 billion. Similarly, related commodities such as milk and feedstock experienced a deficit of RM2.6 billion and RM10.2 billion respectively in 2018.\n\nThe data implies that, first, the demand for meat and milk is far greater than local supply, which has shown slow growth in the last five decades. Second, Malaysia depends on imported feedstock for her cows.\n\nThe agencies involved in monitoring the sector include the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP), Department of Veterinary Services (DVS), Jabatan Kemajuan Islam Malaysia (Jakim), Malaysian Quarantine and Inspection Services (Maqis), Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), the Royal Malaysian Customs Department (RMCD) and Port Police (PP).\n\nIn simple terms, the cartel uses fake halal certificates for meat from uncertified sources from the point of slaughter, either at the exporting country or at local warehouses, until it reaches consumers. The activities involved are acquisition, storing, processing, smuggling, manipulation, abetting and bringing into the country the non-certified frozen meat through approved import permits.\n\nThe real modus operandi involves a web of collaborative work of the cartel, suppliers, officials and traders both overseas and on the domestic scene. It is alleged that the first point of faking halal certificates may occur at slaughterhouses overseas, which have to get halal certification under the purview of Jakim and DVS. Once the cartel bypasses the first stage of inspection, the rest of the procedures are less of a hurdle.\n\nOnce the meat reaches the ports, the cartel again could move in smoothly with the help of \u201crepresentatives\u201d of very senior officials from government agencies working with it. Upon reaching the warehouses, the meat would be mixed with halal-certified meat and repacked with fake halal logos, then released to the market.\n\nThe supporting structure under which this malpractice takes place is described as follows.\n\nFirst, Malaysia is continuously dependent on meat imports (particularly beef and lamb), owing largely to growing demand, while local production shows the reverse trend. Local production is weak because of low productivity, high cost of production and inefficient small farms. These result in inflows of meat from efficient producers such as Australia, New Zealand and Argentina at relatively lower prices than local sources.\n\nSecond, arbitrage activities thrive when there is a big price gap between two locations. For instance, there are 124 illegal jetties in Kelantan where the black market or smuggling of goods and food commodities has been active for many decades. This occurs because the prices in Thailand are cheaper than in Malaysia. A similar analogy applies in the case of meat imports.\n\nThird, standards, sanitary and phytosanitary requirements and halal certification involve costs and disruption. As such, barriers \u2014 especially those that are messy and costly \u2014 incentivise traders to avoid or bypass the rules wherever possible. Some go to the extreme by violating the law and regulations, especially if the monitoring procedures are weak and ineffective.\n\nFourth, the import industry is oligopolistic in nature, where collusion among members is rampant, as proven in this case.\n\nFifth, it is highly probable that lowly paid government servants are drawn to receive bribes, especially when governance is weak, as proven by the alleged abuse that is said to have occurred for 40 years.\n\nSixth, with six agencies involved in monitoring meat imports, it is highly probable that there exists a redundancy of functions that deter efficiency. Seventh, non-governmental organisations and consumers that have the power to bring about change failed to sound the warning bell.\n\nThe convergence of these factors has led to the scandal being untouched by the law.\n\nWhat are the policy implications? Since this practice has taken root over a long time, no quick solution will undo it. While legal proceedings are a must, medium- and long-term structural changes must be instituted immediately.\n\nFirst, there is an urgent need for a deep inquiry into this matter in terms of the gap between standard operating procedures and reality, the major players that are responsible, the weakest links in the supply chain, the governance structure and the role of public agencies.\n\nSecond, there is an urgent need to increase local production through improvement in productivity and cost reduction. The livestock producers must be empowered with skills, knowledge and advanced technologies to improve production. Production cost can be reduced by using local materials such as palm kernel cake and other sources.\n\nThird, the farmers\u2019 cooperatives have to be strengthened to improve domestic production. Small farms find it hard to sustain production, owing to limited capital for investment but, through this vehicle, they may share resources and gain economies of scale.\n\nFourth, the National Feedlot Centre is not feasible, as it is highly centralised and has proved to be vulnerable to rent-seeking practices in the past. It can be replaced by support measures and incentives to encourage private abattoirs that are more competitive, run either by individuals or cooperatives.\n\nFifth, the cartel can be diffused by competition. The import sector should be opened up to more participants so that market control or any predatory move is checked by the competing participants.\n\nSixth, the data speaks the truth. Digitalisation of the supply chain may provide transactional transparency to all participants, hence minimising malpractices. Among the applications are blockchain, an information and communications technology solution whose distributed ledger technology allows data to be stored on servers. It creates secure, real-time communication networks with partners along the supply chain. The system makes it difficult for one user to gain control of, or game, the network.\n\nMaybe Malaysia is not ready for this, but the concept is of high utility. For a start, the country should focus on developing a complete database of who is doing what as well as their business profile. Data to be monitored is all the players\u2019 profiles, including overseas slaughter houses, in terms of production, quantity and quality traded, price, origin or source of meat, and prices. From the data one can detect irregularities such as a sudden increase in quantity or changes in prices or sources of origin. Such tracking may minimise malpractices along the supply chain. Once these databases are running well, then more sophisticated transaction apps such as blockchain may be considered.\n\nIn short, the issue of fake halal certificates is just a symptom of a deeper structural disease. This refers to a non-transparent procurement system, weak governance, oligopolistic import market and too many agencies involved, resulting in fragmented monitoring and attractive arbitrage opportunities, owing to low domestic production. It mirrors a systemic failure that requires a system overhaul.\n\nProf Datin Paduka Fatimah Mohamed Arshad is head of the agriculture and food security cluster at the Academy of Professors Malaysia.

Baru and See had betrayed the party by leaving PKR early last year and the departure of Baru had contributed to the downfall of the Pakatan Harapan (PH) federal government at the time.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference at the PKR Kuching and Stampin Branch office at Jalan Sin Sin Park here today, Ng admitted the state PKR had been weakened following the departure of the duo.\n\n\u201cHowever, it only makes us more determined to come back especially in the seats that these people won under PKR. The party is weakened, no doubt, but we will rise again in debacle.\n\n\u201cThey betrayed not only the party but contributed to the downfall of PH. We call them traitors. The party must learn from the setback,\u201d said the former Padungan assemblyman who served from 2006 to 2011.\n\nBaru and See contested and won in the 2016 state polls under the ticket of PKR, but they joined PSB late May last year, after being sacked by PKR following the collapse of the PH government.

It is best for Baru to explain to the public whether he was expelled or he left the party.\n\n\u201cHe should explain to the people, and not keeping quiet,\u201d he said, with Ng adding: \u201cOh, he described himself as a \u2018clever frog\u2019.\u201d\n\nJoshua, who has been with PKR since 2009, said Baru was not thrown out by the party.

for a policy to address birds\u2019 nests on electricity pylons or telecommunication towers.\n\nIn a statement today, MNS Terengganu said it was informed of an active white-bellied sea eagle nest on a telecommunication tower in Merang, Terengganu, which had newly-laid eggs but was \u201cdestroyed\u201d by the tower operators.\n\nThe eagles are classified as a totally protected species under the Wildlife Conservation Act 2010.\n\n\u201cThis is against the Wildlife Conservation Act 2010.\n\n\u201cRather than wait a few months for the family of eagles to raise their young, their future was abruptly terminated,\u201d MNS Terengganu chairman Wong Chee Ho said.\n\nNoting that the country currently lacks any policies on how to deal with nests on towers, Wong proposed a meeting with power company operators in Terengganu, as well as the telecommunication companies that use such towers, to formulate a statewide solution which would be the first for the country.\n\n\u201cWe want to create a new policy to better manage this problem in a way that protects wildlife and ensures the safety of all, including meeting the needs of the corporations and the services they provide.\n\n\u201cThe costs of monitoring all towers and keeping them nest-free is much more than the cost of supporting new and innovative ways of learning to live with the birds,\u201d he said.\n\nWong noted that while many eagles have traditionally constructed their nests on tall trees, more of them are using man-made structures instead.\n\nApart from being taller than many of the surrounding trees and giving birds of prey a better vantage point to survey their territory, such structures are also sturdy and able to support large nests.\n\nWith the expansion of electricity distribution over the past century, and the more recent surge in telecommunication towers, more birds are choosing man-made structures to build their nests.\n\nHowever, nesting birds are known to have disrupted electricity and telecommunication services provided through the towers, while nests made of dry wood and grass can cause fires which lead to service loss for the public and expensive repairs for the companies involved.\n\nPointing out that birds like the white-bellied sea eagle are territorial, Wong said once they have selected a site to nest, they will return to it year after year and rebuild even if their nests are removed.\n\nWhile he admitted some nests will have to be removed as they pose a threat to the company and the birds themselves, Wong stressed the need for a policy on nest removal that does not destroy wildlife.\n\n\u201cPower and telecommunication companies need to explore other ways to resolve this conflict,\u201d he said, suggesting a few solutions that could be

The Yuet Wan is likely the only group still active in Malaysia,\u201d he told theSun.\n\nLeong lays the blame partly on the failure to instil a love for the art among the younger people.\n\nAs a young man practising an age-old art, he is a rarity. He still dons the full regalia for the occasional performance.\n\nLeong laments the fact that many sifus, or masters of the art form, have not been able to find sufficient interest among the younger generation to whom they can pass on their skills.\n\nOpera, Leong pointed out, is an art form that takes years to learn and even longer to perfect. Another setback is the high cost of the costumes.\n\n\u201cOur costumes cost thousands of ringgit, but we do not earn enough to cover even a fraction of that,\u201d he added.\n\nA three-night performance today would bring barely RM400 to the table. But the destroyer of the opera may yet be its saviour.\n\nLeong is looking to new technology to advance a bold plan \u2013 to give Cantonese opera a revival. He has assembled a troupe of 10 young social media wizards to advance his plan.\n\n\u201cThe young participants have paved more paths for better exposure of Cantonese opera through Facebook and Instagram,\u201d he said.\n\nMany challenges remain.\n\n\u201cFor instance, there are not enough musically-talented people who are interested in opera,\u201d he said.\n\nLeong, who has been pursuing his love for the art with the association since 2016, said the immediate priority is to find a new set of talents who can play traditional Chinese musical instruments.\n\n\u201cWe strive for authenticity so we don\u2019t use pre-recorded music for our shows. We still rely on older members to provide the music but we need younger people to take over,\u201d he said.\n\nLots of practice is essential, as the association\u2019s long-time sifu Yoong Poo Hiong pointed out. \u201cShe often reminds us to follow her teachings closely so we may pass on the \u2018full package\u2019 to the next generation. This is a life-long learning experience.\u201d\n\nLeong still harbours hopes that more young people will be drawn to the art.\n\n\u201cI would like to see the Cantonese opera recognised as a Malaysian art form although it originates in China.\n\n\u201cThe Tourism, Arts and Culture Ministry should look into rekindling dying arts and traditions such as ours to boost tourism.

MOH Explains What Happens\n\n1. Get in touch with your district health office\n\nIf you suspect you have contracted the illness, get yourself tested. If you have already tested positive, the Health Ministry\u2019s tweet says that the district health office will contact patients to undergo Covid-19 swab tests.\n\nOnce confirmed positive, they will provide a Monitoring and Observation Order and a quarantine band for positive patients staying at home.\n\n2. The positive patient will need to stay at home for 10 days\n\nQuarantine at home will mean that you won\u2019t be allowed to leave your house for any reason for the period of 10 days.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) also advises that you avoid having visitors over and that they should not interact with the patient under any circumstances.\n\n3. The positive patient should not share a room with any other household members\n\nEven though still at home, you\u2019ll have to separate yourself from the rest of your household to avoid accidentally infecting them. (Credit: Unsplash)\n\nUnless this is possible, home quarantine shouldn\u2019t be your first choice.\n\nA separate room with adequate ventilation should be allocated for the patient. Other household members should stay and sleep in another room and be separated from the patient at all times.\n\nIf possible, other household members should also avoid sharing the same bathroom with the infected person. If you have no choice, WHO advises that taps, doorknobs, and other items are cleaned regularly with soap and water.\n\n4. Household members will have to always wear a face mask and maintain 1 \u2013 2 meters of physical distance from the patient\n\nYes, if you are positive and choose to quarantine at home, your other household members will have to constantly wear a face mask while at home. You must also constantly maintain a physical distance from them to avoid getting them infected as well.\n\n5. Meals, drinks and other essential items should be placed outside the patient\u2019s room door to be taken by themselves\n\nYou and your household members will need to constantly wear a mask while at home during your quarantine period and maintain physical distance from you at all times. (Credit: Unsplash)\n\nPractice contactless delivery when passing food and other essential items to the patient to minimise physical contact between the positive individuals and other members of the household.\n\n6. Other household members will need to wear gloves when handling items used by the positive patient.\n\nWhen handling items used by the infected individual, such as plates, cups, and eating utensils, household members will need to wear disposable gloves.\n\nAfter use, the gloves should be properly discarded without reuse, preferably in a closed container.\n\nWHO advises that separate dishes, cups, eating utensils, bedding, towels, and other essential items be assigned for the infected person.\n\nBeddings, towels, and clothes used by the infected person should be washed with soap and water separately from those used by the rest of the household.\n\n7. The positive patient and other household members should wash their hands with soap and water or use hand sanitiser as frequently as possible.\n\nFrequently washing your hands will reduce the chances of your household members contracting the infection from you.\n\nWash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds at a time and use alcohol-based hand sanitiser when you don\u2019t have the immediate option of using water and soap.\n\nHousehold members should also avoid touching their eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.\n\n8.

Sure, maybe instant noodles or spaghetti might be simple enough to whip up, but Malaysians need good \u2018ol Malaysian food to keep ourselves happy.\n\nBut Malaysian food, such as sambal belacan, is notoriously labourous and difficult, and you have no real cooking experience\u2026 is it possible?\n\nActually, the answer is yes. If someone else has already done all the hard parts of cooking for you.\n\nWe spoke to celebrity chef Sherson Lian, who gave us some tips and tricks on how to make an extremely simple Malaysia\u2019s favourite ikan sambal belacan with almost none of the labour that comes with it.\n\n3-Ingredient Ikan Sambal Belacan\n\nIngredients:\n\nIkan kembung (leatherjacket fish, readily available already cleaned, gutted, and descaled at grocery stores or at the fishmonger\u2019s)\n\nTumeric\n\nSalt\n\nPre-made sambal belacan paste\n\nBanana leaves (optional)\n\nFish, sambal belacan paste, and tumeric. That\u2019s all you need.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\nPreperation:\n\n1) Pat dry the fish. Cut two pockets on both sides along the fish\u2019s spine. (Chef\u2019s note: If you are having trouble with slicing through the flesh, try sharpening your knife. A dull knife can easily cause injuries to yourself.)\n\n2) Give the fish a generous tumeric rub to get rid of its fishy smell, including the insides of the pockets. Then, season it with a little salt.\n\nDo it like salt bae.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\n3) Scoop your sambal belacan paste into the pockets. Be generous with it, but most importantly, use a new clean and dry spoon in between the scoops as you do not want to contaminate the sambal paste.\n\nPockets are meant to be stuffed.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\n4) Heat up a pan to medium-high heat. If you have banana leaves, place it in the pan.\n\n5) Drizzle some oil over the fish. Then, place the fish in the pan.\n\nUse tongs to make it easier to handle the fish.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\n6) Flip the fish and ensure both sides are cooked. (Chef\u2019s note: Ikan kembung has thick skin, so the usual way to check if it\u2019s cooked by poking a fork into the meat won\u2019t work. Instead, check the eyes- they should turn completely white. However, you can leave it to cook a little longer if you\u2019re not sure as this fish is very forgiving to being overcooked.)\n\n7) Serve with rice and enjoy.\n\nA hot, piping meal is ready, all from the comfort of your own home.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\nSherson notes that sambal belacan is one of those sides that goes well with everything and every family has their own secret recipe. Still, it\u2019s a great beginner paste, and you can easily modify the recipe or use different kinds of protein to pair with the sambal belacan.\n\nIf you put the ikan sambal belacan on a fresh piece of bana leaf with some ceylon as garnish, you could even impress a date!\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\nThe one used here is from Sherson\u2019s line of Rencah pastes and condiments and is also used in his restaurants.

The implementation of halal certification is governed by the Trade Description Act and Orders related thereto.\n\nThe Act empowers Jakim as a competent authority in the issuance of the halal logo. This is rightly so, as an authority is required to guarantee that the products are genuinely halal in compliance with the Shariah principles. However, Jakim can only carry out inspections to ensure compliance. Any infringement may only result in the withdrawal of Jakim halal certificate. Jakim cannot exercise enforcement power, as the main player under the Act is the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP), while Jakim merely testifies as witnesses.\n\nFurthermore, the law does not impose an obligation that all foods are marked halal. Traders and manufacturers apply for certification voluntarily. If they choose not to apply but opt to forge certification, certainly Jakim could hardly be blamed. In the same way we do not blame Bank Negara for the forged currency floating, so too can we blame Jakim for the forged halal certification. Apart from KPDNHEP, the blame equally lies on the Customs, Royal Malaysia Police and local authorities who have halal execution power in their by-laws.\n\nThe consumption of halal food is a fundamental right of Muslims under the Constitution, yet as of today, our right to get halal food is not strictly guaranteed. The Malay Consultative Council should work towards that direction, rather than admonish a Muslim authority, albeit Jakim.\n\nOne unfortunate shortcoming of Jakim was their delayed reaction in \u201csetting the record straight\u201d. Unfortunately, the world is now \u201cforced\u201d to deal with the \u201cgame of perception\u201d. Keeping quiet, delayed response or failure to anticipate and manage negative perceptions may be at any organisation\u2019s detriment.\n\nThis is not the first time Jakim has been put under scrutiny for matters which were not directly under their purview. In this case, however, Jakim must understand that the word \u201chalal\u201d in itself will pull them into the \u201cfray\u201d regardless of their involvement.\n\nHence, Jakim should at least invest in effective communication and perception management team which would do them a lot of much-deserved justice.", "keyword": ["halal", "compliance", "authority", "scrutiny", "jakim", "pushing", "stop", "blame", "trade", "certification", "act", "food"], "summary": "The implementation of halal certification is governed by the Trade Description Act and Orders related thereto.\nThe Act empowers Jakim as a competent authority in the issuance of the halal logo.\nAny infringement may only result in the withdrawal of Jakim halal certificate.\nIn the same way we do not blame Bank Negara for the forged currency floating, so too can we blame Jakim for the forged halal certification.\nThe consumption of halal food is a fundamental right of Muslims under the Constitution, yet as of today, our right to get halal food is not strictly guaranteed.", "news": "The Malaysian Reserve", "date": "2021-01-07 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "MCO 2.0: Shopping malls can operate", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEG8IJUQ3Meh3UcdzzUFh9KUqGQgEKhAIACoHCAow9sveCjC0m9YBMPDtoQM?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/pogb18_NSTfield_image_socialmedia.var_1610506085.jpg", "text": "", "keyword": ["shopping", "operate", "malls", "mco", "20"], "summary": "", "news": "New Straits Times", "date": "2021-01-13 00:00:00", "language": "INDONESIA"}, {"title": "My Say: Halal meat fiasco begs a system overhaul", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWVkZ2VtYXJrZXRzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL215LXNheS1oYWxhbC1tZWF0LWZpYXNjby1iZWdzLXN5c3RlbS1vdmVyaGF1bNIBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://assets.theedgemarkets.com/Forum-Daging_20210111181717_theedgemarkets.jpg?KUEcITxU5mqfKqlzdYICPqyH.Bfx47eI", "text": "The imported halal meat fiasco has all the elemental components of a crime: smuggling; faking; a network of cheating syndicates, from the starting point to the consumer table; multinational actors to facilitate multiple functions at multiple points; and unchecked and unpunished, allegedly, for 40 years.\n\nIt is another corruption case that the public has to swallow. This time, the public is robbed of safe, genuine, quality and, to the Muslims, halal meat \u2014 a betrayal in all dimensions to consumers.\n\nThe case begs the question as to why it was left unchecked for such a long time. Logically, it means that it must have been well planned, tested and proven, or that the system is so weak that it failed to prevent such a serious situation.\n\nLet us look at the industry landscape that allows such a practice to breed. In 2018, the self-sufficiency level for meat stood at 22%, where the consumption per capita was 6.3kg per year, import value was RM3.8 billion and export value was RM1.2 billion, giving a trade deficit of RM2.6 billion. Similarly, related commodities such as milk and feedstock experienced a deficit of RM2.6 billion and RM10.2 billion respectively in 2018.\n\nThe data implies that, first, the demand for meat and milk is far greater than local supply, which has shown slow growth in the last five decades. Second, Malaysia depends on imported feedstock for her cows.\n\nThe agencies involved in monitoring the sector include the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP), Department of Veterinary Services (DVS), Jabatan Kemajuan Islam Malaysia (Jakim), Malaysian Quarantine and Inspection Services (Maqis), Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), the Royal Malaysian Customs Department (RMCD) and Port Police (PP).\n\nIn simple terms, the cartel uses fake halal certificates for meat from uncertified sources from the point of slaughter, either at the exporting country or at local warehouses, until it reaches consumers. The activities involved are acquisition, storing, processing, smuggling, manipulation, abetting and bringing into the country the non-certified frozen meat through approved import permits.\n\nThe real modus operandi involves a web of collaborative work of the cartel, suppliers, officials and traders both overseas and on the domestic scene. It is alleged that the first point of faking halal certificates may occur at slaughterhouses overseas, which have to get halal certification under the purview of Jakim and DVS. Once the cartel bypasses the first stage of inspection, the rest of the procedures are less of a hurdle.\n\nOnce the meat reaches the ports, the cartel again could move in smoothly with the help of \u201crepresentatives\u201d of very senior officials from government agencies working with it. Upon reaching the warehouses, the meat would be mixed with halal-certified meat and repacked with fake halal logos, then released to the market.\n\nThe supporting structure under which this malpractice takes place is described as follows.\n\nFirst, Malaysia is continuously dependent on meat imports (particularly beef and lamb), owing largely to growing demand, while local production shows the reverse trend. Local production is weak because of low productivity, high cost of production and inefficient small farms. These result in inflows of meat from efficient producers such as Australia, New Zealand and Argentina at relatively lower prices than local sources.\n\nSecond, arbitrage activities thrive when there is a big price gap between two locations. For instance, there are 124 illegal jetties in Kelantan where the black market or smuggling of goods and food commodities has been active for many decades. This occurs because the prices in Thailand are cheaper than in Malaysia. A similar analogy applies in the case of meat imports.\n\nThird, standards, sanitary and phytosanitary requirements and halal certification involve costs and disruption. As such, barriers \u2014 especially those that are messy and costly \u2014 incentivise traders to avoid or bypass the rules wherever possible. Some go to the extreme by violating the law and regulations, especially if the monitoring procedures are weak and ineffective.\n\nFourth, the import industry is oligopolistic in nature, where collusion among members is rampant, as proven in this case.\n\nFifth, it is highly probable that lowly paid government servants are drawn to receive bribes, especially when governance is weak, as proven by the alleged abuse that is said to have occurred for 40 years.\n\nSixth, with six agencies involved in monitoring meat imports, it is highly probable that there exists a redundancy of functions that deter efficiency. Seventh, non-governmental organisations and consumers that have the power to bring about change failed to sound the warning bell.\n\nThe convergence of these factors has led to the scandal being untouched by the law.\n\nWhat are the policy implications? Since this practice has taken root over a long time, no quick solution will undo it. While legal proceedings are a must, medium- and long-term structural changes must be instituted immediately.\n\nFirst, there is an urgent need for a deep inquiry into this matter in terms of the gap between standard operating procedures and reality, the major players that are responsible, the weakest links in the supply chain, the governance structure and the role of public agencies.\n\nSecond, there is an urgent need to increase local production through improvement in productivity and cost reduction. The livestock producers must be empowered with skills, knowledge and advanced technologies to improve production. Production cost can be reduced by using local materials such as palm kernel cake and other sources.\n\nThird, the farmers\u2019 cooperatives have to be strengthened to improve domestic production. Small farms find it hard to sustain production, owing to limited capital for investment but, through this vehicle, they may share resources and gain economies of scale.\n\nFourth, the National Feedlot Centre is not feasible, as it is highly centralised and has proved to be vulnerable to rent-seeking practices in the past. It can be replaced by support measures and incentives to encourage private abattoirs that are more competitive, run either by individuals or cooperatives.\n\nFifth, the cartel can be diffused by competition. The import sector should be opened up to more participants so that market control or any predatory move is checked by the competing participants.\n\nSixth, the data speaks the truth. Digitalisation of the supply chain may provide transactional transparency to all participants, hence minimising malpractices. Among the applications are blockchain, an information and communications technology solution whose distributed ledger technology allows data to be stored on servers. It creates secure, real-time communication networks with partners along the supply chain. The system makes it difficult for one user to gain control of, or game, the network.\n\nMaybe Malaysia is not ready for this, but the concept is of high utility. For a start, the country should focus on developing a complete database of who is doing what as well as their business profile. Data to be monitored is all the players\u2019 profiles, including overseas slaughter houses, in terms of production, quantity and quality traded, price, origin or source of meat, and prices. From the data one can detect irregularities such as a sudden increase in quantity or changes in prices or sources of origin. Such tracking may minimise malpractices along the supply chain. Once these databases are running well, then more sophisticated transaction apps such as blockchain may be considered.\n\nIn short, the issue of fake halal certificates is just a symptom of a deeper structural disease. This refers to a non-transparent procurement system, weak governance, oligopolistic import market and too many agencies involved, resulting in fragmented monitoring and attractive arbitrage opportunities, owing to low domestic production.

simple, clear SOPs for the public to follow.\n\nChan, who is also the secretary of Democratic Action Party (DAP) Sabah, opined that the business sectors that were allowed to operate during MCO could be determined by common sense, whereas the sectors or services that were prohibited from opening should comply with the directive.\n\nFor instance, night markets, reflexologies, spa, hair salons, optical shops, boutiques, sports and recreational activities (except for jogging limited to two persons from the same household and cycling), mass gatherings, tourism activities, tuition classes, music classes, dance classes, language classes, entertainment outlets, indoor playground, karaoke outlets, cinemas, meetings, seminars, exhibitions, wedding banquets, birthdays and interstate and inter-district travels were banned unless in emergency situation, while employees in essential sectors must show their work pass or employer\u2019s authorization letter.\n\nHe said the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) has issued a statement on Tuesday detailing the permitted activities under the trade and distribution sector, which included shopping malls, supermarkets and hypermarkets, departmental stores, pharmacies, convenience stores, laundry shops (excluding self-service), restaurants, furniture shops, jewellery stores, electric and electronics stores,

Malaysian Islamic Development Department (Jakim).A raid on the factory was done after one month of surveillance, the department's director Muhamad Zikri Azan Abdullah said.\n\"The company\u2019s halal logo issued by Jakim was cancelled on Oct 28 last year, on the grounds that the company had failed to observe the halal compliance requirements especially pertaining to the cleanliness of the premises.\u201cDuring the raid, the company\u2019s representative also informed that they had made an appeal regarding the withdrawal of the halal certificate, but this was rejected as the company failed to act on the religious department\u2019s instructions within the stipulated period,\" he reportedly said.The authorities are investigating the case under Paragraph 4 of the Trade Descriptions (Definition of Halal) Order 2011 and Regulation 4 of the Trade Descriptions (Certification and Marking of Halal) Order 2011.It's really not that easy to get Halal certification and it's more than just the meat used in a product.Besides using only halal mean for production and in a premise, there are other requirements that a company has to meet to get the certification.One of it is cleanliness, which this particular noodle company seem to have neglected.According to Malaysian Halal Certification Procedure Manual , in order to get a Halal certification, a company \"during preparation, handling, processing, packaging, storage or transfer of products, they shall be in compliance to requirements by the Shariah law and remain clean as well as comply to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP)/ Good Hygienic Practices (GHP)\", among other things.Other provision regarding cleanliness in the manual includes:You can see the full list of requirements to get a Halal certification here",

Ba Kelalan assemblyman Baru Bian and Batu Lintang assemblyman See Chee How \u2018traitors\u2019 for joining Parti Sarawak Bersatu (PSB) last year.\n\nIts Kuching branch chief Dominique Ng said both Baru and See had betrayed the party by leaving PKR early last year and the departure of Baru had contributed to the downfall of the Pakatan Harapan (PH) federal government at the time.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference at the PKR Kuching and Stampin Branch office at Jalan Sin Sin Park here today, Ng admitted the state PKR had been weakened following the departure of the duo.\n\n\u201cHowever, it only makes us more determined to come back especially in the seats that these people won under PKR. The party is weakened, no doubt, but we will rise again in debacle.\n\n\u201cThey betrayed not only the party but contributed to the downfall of PH. We call them traitors. The party must learn from the setback,\u201d said the former Padungan assemblyman who served from 2006 to 2011.\n\nBaru and See contested and won in the 2016 state polls under the ticket of PKR, but they joined PSB late May last year, after being sacked by PKR following the collapse of the PH government. Baru, who is Selangau MP, is former Works Minister.\n\nState PKR secretary Joshua Jabeng, who was also present, said the party noted that political analysts and even the media had dubbed PKR as \u201ca gone case\u201d given the departure of Baru and See.\n\n\u201cPolitical scientists and the media have been running us down. Some even said PKR expelled them. It is best for Baru to explain to the public whether he was expelled or he left the party.\n\n\u201cHe should explain to the people, and not keeping quiet,\u201d he said, with Ng adding: \u201cOh, he described himself as a \u2018clever frog\u2019.\u201d\n\nJoshua, who has been with PKR since 2009, said Baru was not thrown out by the party. He even recalled that he \u201cstepped aside in Selangau\u201d for Baru to stand.\n\n\u201cMy heart is so big. He\u2019d been the state chief.

for a policy to address birds\u2019 nests on electricity pylons or telecommunication towers.\n\nIn a statement today, MNS Terengganu said it was informed of an active white-bellied sea eagle nest on a telecommunication tower in Merang, Terengganu, which had newly-laid eggs but was \u201cdestroyed\u201d by the tower operators.\n\nThe eagles are classified as a totally protected species under the Wildlife Conservation Act 2010.\n\n\u201cThis is against the Wildlife Conservation Act 2010.\n\n\u201cRather than wait a few months for the family of eagles to raise their young, their future was abruptly terminated,\u201d MNS Terengganu chairman Wong Chee Ho said.\n\nNoting that the country currently lacks any policies on how to deal with nests on towers, Wong proposed a meeting with power company operators in Terengganu, as well as the telecommunication companies that use such towers, to formulate a statewide solution which would be the first for the country.\n\n\u201cWe want to create a new policy to better manage this problem in a way that protects wildlife and ensures the safety of all, including meeting the needs of the corporations and the services they provide.\n\n\u201cThe costs of monitoring all towers and keeping them nest-free is much more than the cost of supporting new and innovative ways of learning to live with the birds,\u201d he said.\n\nWong noted that while many eagles have traditionally constructed their nests on tall trees, more of them are using man-made structures instead.\n\nApart from being taller than many of the surrounding trees and giving birds of prey a better vantage point to survey their territory, such structures are also sturdy and able to support large nests.\n\nWith the expansion of electricity distribution over the past century, and the more recent surge in telecommunication towers, more birds are choosing man-made structures to build their nests.\n\nHowever, nesting birds are known to have disrupted electricity and telecommunication services provided through the towers, while nests made of dry wood and grass can cause fires which lead to service loss for the public and expensive repairs for the companies involved.\n\nPointing out that birds like the white-bellied sea eagle are territorial, Wong said once they have selected a site to nest, they will return to it year after year and rebuild even if their nests are removed.\n\nWhile he admitted some nests will have to be removed as they pose a threat to the company and the birds themselves, Wong stressed the need for a policy on nest removal that does not destroy wildlife.\n\n\u201cPower and telecommunication companies need to explore other ways to resolve this conflict,\u201d he said, suggesting a few solutions that could be incorporated.\n\n\u201cOne solution could be adding a platform to the towers, placed in a safe location, and made suitable for birds of prey to use as nesting platforms.\n\n\u201cCameras could be installed to record video of the nesting birds. This video could be shared as a live feed to generate interest among the public and showcase conservation activities of the corporations involved.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["nesting", "terengganu", "towers", "structures", "wildlife", "policy", "birds", "regrets", "eagles", "telecommunication", "nature", "nests", "removal", "rare", "telco", "nest", "group", "tower"], "summary": "PETALING JAYA: The Malaysian Nature Society (MNS) has called for a policy to address birds\u2019 nests on electricity pylons or telecommunication towers.\nIn a statement today, MNS Terengganu said it was informed of an active white-bellied sea eagle nest on a telecommunication tower in Merang, Terengganu, which had newly-laid eggs but was \u201cdestroyed\u201d by the tower operators.\nThe eagles are classified as a totally protected species under the Wildlife Conservation Act 2010.\nWong noted that while many eagles have traditionally constructed their nests on tall trees, more of them are using man-made structures instead.\n\u201cCameras could be installed to record video of the nesting birds.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-01-11 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Breathing new life into dying art form", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN1bmRhaWx5Lm15L2xvY2FsL2JyZWF0aGluZy1uZXctbGlmZS1pbnRvLWR5aW5nLWFydC1mb3JtLUFGNjA0Mzk5MtIBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://www.thesundaily.my/binrepository/480x320/0c6/480d250/none/11808/NOOF/image-1981530_1983190_20210111114043.jpg", "text": "BACK when the web was what spiders spun and the TV was in black and white, the Chinese opera was the entertainment that drew large crowds.\n\nToday, such performances are staged only occasionally, mostly on significant dates such as the Hungry Ghost Festival.\n\nFor the younger generation, who have unlimited entertainment options thanks to new technology, sitting in the moonlight for a\n\nthree-hour stage retelling of palace intrigue or lost love is no longer as magical.\n\nBut, if Chinese opera enthusiast Daryl Leong, 43, has his way, the lost art may yet get a revival, thanks to technology.\n\nIn Malaysia, the Chinese opera, in various dialects such as Cantonese, Teochew and Hokkien, had its hey day in the 1920s and 1930s,\n\nwhen several troupes travelled across the country to perform for eager fans.\n\nHowever, the number of local troupes eventually dwindled, replaced mostly by those from Thailand, particularly for performances in the Teochew dialect.\n\nAccording to Leong, who is chief secretary of the Yuet Wan Cantonese Opera Association Kuala Lumpur, urbanisation and globalisation also led to a decline, and eventual demise, of the opera.\n\n\u201cMany associations folded up when their opera troupes could not keep up with the times. The Yuet Wan is likely the only group still active in Malaysia,\u201d he told theSun.\n\nLeong lays the blame partly on the failure to instil a love for the art among the younger people.\n\nAs a young man practising an age-old art, he is a rarity. He still dons the full regalia for the occasional performance.\n\nLeong laments the fact that many sifus, or masters of the art form, have not been able to find sufficient interest among the younger generation to whom they can pass on their skills.\n\nOpera, Leong pointed out, is an art form that takes years to learn and even longer to perfect. Another setback is the high cost of the costumes.\n\n\u201cOur costumes cost thousands of ringgit, but we do not earn enough to cover even a fraction of that,\u201d he added.\n\nA three-night performance today would bring barely RM400 to the table. But the destroyer of the opera may yet be its saviour.\n\nLeong is looking to new technology to advance a bold plan \u2013 to give Cantonese opera a revival. He has assembled a troupe of 10 young social media wizards to advance his plan.\n\n\u201cThe young participants have paved more paths for better exposure of Cantonese opera through Facebook and Instagram,\u201d he said.\n\nMany challenges remain.\n\n\u201cFor instance, there are not enough musically-talented people who are interested in opera,\u201d he said.\n\nLeong, who has been pursuing his love for the art with the association since 2016, said the immediate priority is to find a new set of talents who can play traditional Chinese musical instruments.\n\n\u201cWe strive for authenticity so we don\u2019t use pre-recorded music for our shows. We still rely on older members to provide the music but we need younger people to take over,\u201d he said.\n\nLots of practice is essential, as the association\u2019s long-time sifu Yoong Poo Hiong pointed out. \u201cShe often reminds us to follow her teachings closely so we may pass on the \u2018full package\u2019 to the next generation. This is a life-long learning experience.\u201d\n\nLeong still harbours hopes that more young people will be drawn to the art.\n\n\u201cI would like to see the Cantonese opera recognised as a Malaysian art form although it originates in China.\n\n\u201cThe Tourism, Arts and Culture Ministry should look into rekindling dying arts and traditions such as ours to boost tourism.

The positive patient will need to stay at home for 10 days\n\nQuarantine at home will mean that you won\u2019t be allowed to leave your house for any reason for the period of 10 days.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) also advises that you avoid having visitors over and that they should not interact with the patient under any circumstances.\n\n3. The positive patient should not share a room with any other household members\n\nEven though still at home, you\u2019ll have to separate yourself from the rest of your household to avoid accidentally infecting them. (Credit: Unsplash)\n\nUnless this is possible, home quarantine shouldn\u2019t be your first choice.\n\nA separate room with adequate ventilation should be allocated for the patient. Other household members should stay and sleep in another room and be separated from the patient at all times.\n\nIf possible, other household members should also avoid sharing the same bathroom with the infected person. If you have no choice, WHO advises that taps, doorknobs, and other items are cleaned regularly with soap and water.\n\n4. Household members will have to always wear a face mask and maintain 1 \u2013 2 meters of physical distance from the patient\n\nYes, if you are positive and choose to quarantine at home, your other household members will have to constantly wear a face mask while at home.

Sure, maybe instant noodles or spaghetti might be simple enough to whip up, but Malaysians need good \u2018ol Malaysian food to keep ourselves happy.\n\nBut Malaysian food, such as sambal belacan, is notoriously labourous and difficult, and you have no real cooking experience\u2026 is it possible?\n\nActually, the answer is yes. If someone else has already done all the hard parts of cooking for you.\n\nWe spoke to celebrity chef Sherson Lian, who gave us some tips and tricks on how to make an extremely simple Malaysia\u2019s favourite ikan sambal belacan with almost none of the labour that comes with it.\n\n3-Ingredient Ikan Sambal Belacan\n\nIngredients:\n\nIkan kembung (leatherjacket fish, readily available already cleaned, gutted, and descaled at grocery stores or at the fishmonger\u2019s)\n\nTumeric\n\nSalt\n\nPre-made sambal belacan paste\n\nBanana leaves (optional)\n\nFish, sambal belacan paste, and tumeric. That\u2019s all you need.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\nPreperation:\n\n1) Pat dry the fish. Cut two pockets on both sides along the fish\u2019s spine. (Chef\u2019s note: If you are having trouble with slicing through the flesh, try sharpening your knife. A dull knife can easily cause injuries to yourself.)\n\n2) Give the fish a generous tumeric rub to get rid of its fishy smell, including the insides of the pockets. Then, season it with a little salt.\n\nDo it like salt bae.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\n3) Scoop your sambal belacan paste into the pockets. Be generous with it, but most importantly, use a new clean and dry spoon in between the scoops as you do not want to contaminate the sambal paste.\n\nPockets are meant to be stuffed.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\n4) Heat up a pan to medium-high heat. If you have banana leaves, place it in the pan.\n\n5) Drizzle some oil over the fish. Then, place the fish in the pan.\n\nUse tongs to make it easier to handle the fish.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\n6) Flip the fish and ensure both sides are cooked. (Chef\u2019s note: Ikan kembung has thick skin, so the usual way to check if it\u2019s cooked by poking a fork into the meat won\u2019t work. Instead, check the eyes- they should turn completely white. However, you can leave it to cook a little longer if you\u2019re not sure as this fish is very forgiving to being overcooked.)\n\n7) Serve with rice and enjoy.\n\nA hot, piping meal is ready, all from the comfort of your own home.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\nSherson notes that sambal belacan is one of those sides that goes well with everything and every family has their own secret recipe. Still, it\u2019s a great beginner paste, and you can easily modify the recipe or use different kinds of protein to pair with the sambal belacan.\n\nIf you put the ikan sambal belacan on a fresh piece of bana leaf with some ceylon as garnish, you could even impress a date!\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\nThe one used here is from Sherson\u2019s line of Rencah pastes and condiments and is also used in his restaurants. The chili seeds are blended directly into the paste for a smoother taste and he adds thinly sliced calamansi skin for an extra hint of texture and fragrance.\n\nBut this recipe will work with any pre-prepared sambal belacan paste, you won\u2019t need to spend 4 hours making it from scratch.\n\nPS: Fish not quite your thing?

Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) will be spending RM200 million for the distribution of essential items, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and community drumming programme for rural areas this year.\n\nThe ministry has identified 137 new distribution areas, including islands such as Pulau Tioman, Pulau Perhentian and Pulau Redang in Terengganu and Pahang.\n\nThe ministry said several new areas in Sabah and Sarawak have also been identified for the programme.\n\n\u201cFor 2021, the government has approved an allocation of RM200 million for the programme, which is an increase of RM50 million or 33% compared to last year\u2019s RM150 million.\n\n\u201cThe increment in the allocation allows the ministry to expand the distribution to new areas in need,\u201d it said in a statement yesterday.\n\nFrom its observation, KPDNHEP said people who are living in rural areas have to pay higher prices for essential goods compared to people living in urban areas due to the additional transportation cost.\n\n\u201cIt is due to the high cost of transportation as logistics providers have to travel a long distance to remote areas and through difficult roads, such as logging roads, rivers and rapids,\u201d the ministry said.\n\nIt added that poor connection among infrastructure facilities and various terrain structures such as hills, mountains and islands also contribute to the high transportation costs.\n\nThe programme, which started in 2009, has managed to help the rural community have better access to basic goods like rice, sugar, flour, cooking oil, LPG, RON95 petrol and diesel at controlled prices.\n\n\u201cDistribution of the necessities is carried out by appointed transporters, who buy from trusted suppliers in the city, and send and sell the items to point of

The implementation of halal certification is governed by the Trade Description Act and Orders related thereto.\n\nThe Act empowers Jakim as a competent authority in the issuance of the halal logo. This is rightly so, as an authority is required to guarantee that the products are genuinely halal in compliance with the Shariah principles. However, Jakim can only carry out inspections to ensure compliance. Any infringement may only result in the withdrawal of Jakim halal certificate. Jakim cannot exercise enforcement power, as the main player under the Act is the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP), while Jakim merely testifies as witnesses.\n\nFurthermore, the law does not impose an obligation that all foods are marked halal. Traders and manufacturers apply for certification voluntarily. If they choose not to apply but opt to forge certification, certainly Jakim could hardly be blamed. In the same way we do not blame Bank Negara for the forged currency floating, so too can we blame Jakim for the forged halal certification. Apart from KPDNHEP, the blame equally lies on the Customs, Royal Malaysia Police and local authorities who have halal execution power in their by-laws.\n\nThe consumption of halal food is a fundamental right of Muslims under the Constitution, yet as of today, our right to get halal food is not strictly guaranteed. The Malay Consultative Council should work towards that direction, rather than admonish a Muslim authority, albeit Jakim.\n\nOne unfortunate shortcoming of Jakim was their delayed reaction in \u201csetting the record straight\u201d.

This time, the public is robbed of safe, genuine, quality and, to the Muslims, halal meat \u2014 a betrayal in all dimensions to consumers.\n\nThe case begs the question as to why it was left unchecked for such a long time. Logically, it means that it must have been well planned, tested and proven, or that the system is so weak that it failed to prevent such a serious situation.\n\nLet us look at the industry landscape that allows such a practice to breed. In 2018, the self-sufficiency level for meat stood at 22%, where the consumption per capita was 6.3kg per year, import value was RM3.8 billion and export value was RM1.2 billion, giving a trade deficit of RM2.6 billion. Similarly, related commodities such as milk and feedstock experienced a deficit of RM2.6 billion and RM10.2 billion respectively in 2018.\n\nThe data implies that, first, the demand for meat and milk is far greater than local supply, which has shown slow growth in the last five decades. Second, Malaysia depends on imported feedstock for her cows.\n\nThe agencies involved in monitoring the sector include the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP), Department of Veterinary Services (DVS), Jabatan Kemajuan Islam Malaysia (Jakim), Malaysian Quarantine and Inspection Services (Maqis), Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), the Royal Malaysian Customs Department (RMCD) and Port Police (PP).\n\nIn simple terms, the cartel uses fake halal certificates for meat from uncertified sources from the point of slaughter, either at the exporting country or at local warehouses, until it reaches consumers. The activities involved are acquisition, storing, processing, smuggling, manipulation, abetting and bringing into the country the non-certified frozen meat through approved import permits.\n\nThe real modus operandi involves a web of collaborative work of the cartel, suppliers, officials and traders both overseas and on the domestic scene. It is alleged that the first point of faking halal certificates may occur at slaughterhouses overseas, which have to get halal certification under the purview of Jakim and DVS. Once the cartel bypasses the first stage of inspection, the rest of the procedures are less of a hurdle.\n\nOnce the meat reaches the ports, the cartel again could move in smoothly with the help of \u201crepresentatives\u201d of very senior officials from government agencies working with it. Upon reaching the warehouses, the meat would be mixed with halal-certified meat and repacked with fake halal logos, then released to the market.\n\nThe supporting structure under which this malpractice takes place is described as follows.\n\nFirst, Malaysia is continuously dependent on meat imports (particularly beef and lamb), owing largely to growing demand, while local production shows the reverse trend. Local production is weak because of low productivity, high cost of production and inefficient small farms. These result in inflows of meat from efficient producers such as Australia, New Zealand and Argentina at relatively lower prices than local sources.\n\nSecond, arbitrage activities thrive when there is a big price gap between two locations. For instance, there are 124 illegal jetties in Kelantan where the black market or smuggling of goods and food commodities has been active for many decades. This occurs because the prices in Thailand are cheaper than in Malaysia. A similar analogy applies in the case of meat imports.\n\nThird, standards, sanitary and phytosanitary requirements and halal certification involve costs and disruption. As such, barriers \u2014 especially those that are messy and costly \u2014 incentivise traders to avoid or bypass the rules wherever possible. Some go to the extreme by violating the law and regulations, especially if the monitoring procedures are weak and ineffective.\n\nFourth, the import industry is oligopolistic in nature, where collusion among members is rampant, as proven in this case.\n\nFifth, it is highly probable that lowly paid government servants are drawn to receive bribes, especially when governance is weak, as proven by the alleged abuse that is said to have occurred for 40 years.\n\nSixth, with six agencies involved in monitoring meat imports, it is highly probable that there exists a redundancy of functions that deter efficiency. Seventh, non-governmental organisations and consumers that have the power to bring about change failed to sound the warning bell.\n\nThe convergence of these factors has led to the scandal being untouched by the law.\n\nWhat are the policy implications? Since this practice has taken root over a long time, no quick solution will undo it. While legal proceedings are a must, medium- and long-term structural changes must be instituted immediately.\n\nFirst, there is an urgent need for a deep inquiry into this matter in terms of the gap between standard operating procedures and reality, the major players that are responsible, the weakest links in the supply chain, the governance structure and the role of public agencies.\n\nSecond, there is an urgent need to increase local production through improvement in productivity and cost reduction. The livestock producers must be empowered with skills, knowledge and advanced technologies to improve production. Production cost can be reduced by using local materials such as palm kernel cake and other sources.\n\nThird, the farmers\u2019 cooperatives have to be strengthened to improve domestic production. Small farms find it hard to sustain production, owing to limited capital for investment but, through this vehicle, they may share resources and gain economies of scale.\n\nFourth, the National Feedlot Centre is not feasible, as it is highly centralised and has proved to be vulnerable to rent-seeking practices in the past. It can be replaced by support measures and incentives to encourage private abattoirs that are more competitive, run either by individuals or cooperatives.\n\nFifth, the cartel can be diffused by competition. The import sector should be opened up to more participants so that market control or any predatory move is checked by the competing participants.\n\nSixth, the data speaks the truth. Digitalisation of the supply chain may provide transactional transparency to all participants, hence minimising malpractices. Among the applications are blockchain, an information and communications technology solution whose distributed ledger technology allows data to be stored on servers. It creates secure, real-time communication networks with partners along the supply chain. The system makes it difficult for one user to gain control of, or game, the network.\n\nMaybe Malaysia is not ready for this, but the concept is of high utility. For a start, the country should focus on developing a complete database of who is doing what as well as their business profile. Data to be monitored is all the players\u2019 profiles, including overseas slaughter houses, in terms of production, quantity and quality traded, price, origin or source of meat, and prices. From the data one can detect irregularities such as a sudden increase in quantity or changes in prices or sources of origin. Such tracking may minimise malpractices along the supply chain. Once these databases are running well, then more sophisticated transaction apps such as blockchain may be considered.\n\nIn short, the issue of fake halal certificates is just a symptom of a deeper structural disease. This refers to a non-transparent procurement system, weak governance, oligopolistic import market and too many agencies involved, resulting in fragmented monitoring and attractive arbitrage opportunities, owing to low domestic production. It mirrors a systemic failure that requires a system overhaul.\n\nProf Datin Paduka Fatimah Mohamed Arshad is head of the agriculture and food security cluster at the Academy of Professors Malaysia.

optical shops, boutiques, sports and recreational activities (except for jogging limited to two persons from the same household and cycling), mass gatherings, tourism activities, tuition classes,

Baru and See had betrayed the party by leaving PKR early last year and the departure of Baru had contributed to the downfall of the Pakatan Harapan (PH) federal government at the time.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference at the PKR Kuching and Stampin Branch office at Jalan Sin Sin Park here today, Ng admitted the state PKR had been weakened following the departure of the duo.\n\n\u201cHowever, it

The party must learn from the setback,\u201d said the former Padungan assemblyman who served from 2006 to 2011.\n\nBaru and See contested and won in the 2016 state polls under the ticket of PKR, but they joined PSB late May last year, after being sacked by PKR following the collapse of the PH government.

for a policy to address birds\u2019 nests on electricity pylons or telecommunication towers.\n\nIn a statement today, MNS Terengganu said it was informed of an active white-bellied sea eagle nest on a telecommunication tower in Merang, Terengganu, which had newly-laid eggs but was \u201cdestroyed\u201d by the tower operators.\n\nThe eagles are classified as a totally protected species under the Wildlife Conservation Act 2010.\n\n\u201cThis is against the Wildlife Conservation Act 2010.\n\n\u201cRather than wait a few months for the family of eagles to raise their young, their future was abruptly terminated,\u201d MNS Terengganu chairman Wong Chee Ho said.\n\nNoting that the country currently lacks any policies on how to deal with nests on towers, Wong proposed a meeting with power company operators in Terengganu, as well as the telecommunication companies that use such towers, to formulate a statewide solution which would be the first for the country.\n\n\u201cWe want to create a new policy to better manage this problem in a way that protects wildlife and ensures the safety of all, including meeting the needs of the corporations and the services they provide.\n\n\u201cThe costs of monitoring all towers and keeping them nest-free is much more than the cost of supporting new and innovative ways of learning to live with the birds,\u201d he said.\n\nWong noted that while many eagles have traditionally constructed their nests on tall trees, more of them are using man-made structures instead.\n\nApart from being taller than many of the surrounding trees and giving birds of prey a better vantage point to survey their territory, such structures are also sturdy and able to support large nests.\n\nWith the expansion of electricity distribution over the past century, and the more recent surge in telecommunication towers, more birds are choosing man-made structures to build their nests.\n\nHowever, nesting birds are known to have disrupted electricity and telecommunication services provided through the towers, while nests made of dry wood and grass can cause fires which lead to service loss for the public and expensive repairs for the companies involved.\n\nPointing out that birds like the white-bellied sea eagle are territorial, Wong said once they have selected a site to nest, they will return to it year after year and rebuild even if their nests are removed.\n\nWhile he admitted some nests will have to be removed as they pose a threat to the company and the birds themselves, Wong stressed the need for a policy on nest removal that does not destroy wildlife.\n\n\u201cPower and telecommunication companies need to explore other ways to resolve this conflict,\u201d he said, suggesting a few solutions that could be incorporated.\n\n\u201cOne solution could be adding a platform to the towers, placed in a safe location, and made suitable for birds of prey to use as nesting platforms.\n\n\u201cCameras could be installed to record video of the nesting birds. This video could be shared as a live feed to generate interest among the public and showcase conservation activities of the corporations involved.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["nesting", "terengganu", "towers", "structures", "wildlife", "policy", "birds", "regrets", "eagles", "telecommunication", "nature", "nests", "removal", "rare", "telco", "nest", "group", "tower"], "summary": "PETALING JAYA: The Malaysian Nature Society (MNS) has called for a policy to address birds\u2019 nests on electricity pylons or telecommunication towers.\nIn a statement today, MNS Terengganu said it was informed of an active white-bellied sea eagle nest on a telecommunication tower in Merang, Terengganu, which had newly-laid eggs but was \u201cdestroyed\u201d by the tower operators.\nThe eagles are classified as a totally protected species under the Wildlife Conservation Act 2010.\nWong noted that while many eagles have traditionally constructed their nests on tall trees, more of them are using man-made structures instead.\n\u201cCameras could be installed to record video of the nesting birds.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-01-11 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Breathing new life into dying art form", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN1bmRhaWx5Lm15L2xvY2FsL2JyZWF0aGluZy1uZXctbGlmZS1pbnRvLWR5aW5nLWFydC1mb3JtLUFGNjA0Mzk5MtIBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://www.thesundaily.my/binrepository/480x320/0c6/480d250/none/11808/NOOF/image-1981530_1983190_20210111114043.jpg", "text": "BACK when the web was what spiders spun and the TV was in black and white, the Chinese opera was the entertainment that drew large crowds.\n\nToday, such performances are staged only occasionally, mostly on significant dates such as the Hungry Ghost Festival.\n\nFor the younger generation, who have unlimited entertainment options thanks to new technology, sitting in the moonlight for a\n\nthree-hour stage retelling of palace intrigue or lost love is no longer as magical.\n\nBut, if Chinese opera enthusiast Daryl Leong, 43, has his way, the lost art may yet get a revival, thanks to technology.\n\nIn Malaysia, the Chinese opera, in various dialects such as Cantonese, Teochew and Hokkien, had its hey day in the 1920s and 1930s,\n\nwhen several troupes travelled across the country to perform for eager fans.\n\nHowever, the number of local troupes eventually dwindled, replaced mostly by those from Thailand, particularly for performances in the Teochew dialect.\n\nAccording to Leong, who is chief secretary of the Yuet Wan Cantonese Opera Association Kuala Lumpur, urbanisation and globalisation also led to a decline, and eventual demise, of the opera.\n\n\u201cMany associations folded up when their opera troupes could not keep up with the times. The Yuet Wan is likely the only group still active in Malaysia,\u201d he told theSun.\n\nLeong lays the blame partly on the failure to instil a love for the art among the younger people.\n\nAs a young man practising an age-old art, he is a rarity. He still dons the full regalia for the occasional performance.\n\nLeong laments the fact that many sifus, or masters of the art form, have not been able to find sufficient interest among the younger generation to whom they can pass on their skills.\n\nOpera, Leong pointed out, is an art form that takes years to learn and even longer to perfect. Another setback is the high cost of the costumes.\n\n\u201cOur costumes cost thousands of ringgit, but we do not earn enough to cover even a fraction of that,\u201d he added.\n\nA three-night performance today would bring barely RM400 to the table. But the destroyer of the opera may yet be its saviour.\n\nLeong is looking to new technology to advance a bold plan \u2013 to give Cantonese opera a revival. He has assembled a troupe of 10 young social media wizards to advance his plan.\n\n\u201cThe young participants have paved more paths for better exposure of Cantonese opera through Facebook and Instagram,\u201d he said.\n\nMany challenges remain.\n\n\u201cFor instance, there are not enough musically-talented people who are interested in opera,\u201d he said.\n\nLeong, who has been pursuing his love for the art with the association since 2016, said the immediate priority is to find a new set of talents who can play traditional Chinese musical instruments.\n\n\u201cWe strive for authenticity so we don\u2019t use pre-recorded music for our shows.

MOH Explains What Happens\n\n1. Get in touch with your district health office\n\nIf you suspect you have contracted the illness, get yourself tested. If you have already tested positive, the Health Ministry\u2019s tweet says that the district health office will contact patients to undergo Covid-19 swab tests.\n\nOnce confirmed positive, they will provide a Monitoring and Observation Order and a quarantine band for positive patients staying at home.\n\n2. The positive patient will need to stay at home for 10 days\n\nQuarantine at home will mean that you won\u2019t be allowed to leave your house for any reason for the period of 10 days.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) also advises that you avoid having visitors over and that they should not interact with the patient under any circumstances.\n\n3. The positive patient should not share a room with any other household members\n\nEven though still at home, you\u2019ll have to separate yourself from the rest of your household to avoid accidentally infecting them. (Credit: Unsplash)\n\nUnless this is possible, home quarantine shouldn\u2019t be your first choice.\n\nA separate room with adequate ventilation should be allocated for the patient. Other household members should stay and sleep in another room and be separated from the patient at all times.\n\nIf possible, other household members should also avoid sharing the same bathroom with the infected person. If you have no choice, WHO advises that taps, doorknobs, and other items are cleaned regularly with soap and water.\n\n4. Household members will have to always wear a face mask and maintain 1 \u2013 2 meters of physical distance from the patient\n\nYes, if you are positive and choose to quarantine at home, your other household members will have to constantly wear a face mask while at home. You must also constantly maintain a physical distance from them to avoid getting them infected as well.\n\n5. Meals, drinks and other essential items should be placed outside the patient\u2019s room door to be taken by themselves\n\nYou and your household members will need to constantly wear a mask while at home during your quarantine period and maintain physical distance from you at all times. (Credit: Unsplash)\n\nPractice contactless delivery when passing food and other essential items to the patient to minimise physical contact between the positive individuals and other members of the household.\n\n6. Other household members will need to wear gloves when handling items used by the positive patient.\n\nWhen handling items used by the infected individual, such as plates, cups, and eating utensils, household members will need to wear disposable gloves.\n\nAfter use, the gloves should be properly discarded without reuse, preferably in a closed container.\n\nWHO advises that separate dishes, cups, eating utensils, bedding, towels, and other essential items be assigned for the infected person.\n\nBeddings, towels, and clothes used by the infected person should be washed with soap and water separately from those used by the rest of the household.\n\n7. The positive patient and other household members should wash their hands with soap and water or use hand sanitiser as frequently as possible.\n\nFrequently washing your hands will reduce the chances of your household members contracting the infection from you.\n\nWash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds at a time and use alcohol-based hand sanitiser when you don\u2019t have the immediate option of using water and soap.\n\nHousehold members should also avoid touching their eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.\n\n8. The positive asymptomatic patient should monitor themselves for Covid-19 symptoms and update these on the MySejahtera app.\n\nMonitor your body temperature every day using a thermometer, and if you develop any flu-like symptoms, such as a fever, cough, difficulty breathing, sore throat, or body aches and pain, update these on the MySejahtera app.\n\nCheck out the Health Ministry\u2019s tweet on the matter below:\n\nJika anda tinggal serumah dengan kes positif #COVID19 yang memilih untuk menjalani kuarantin di rumah, ini langkah-langkah pencegahan yang WAJIB anda lakukan. pic.twitter.com/lufnK03pYN \u2014 KKMalaysia\ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\uddfe (@KKMPutrajaya) January 8, 2021\n\nShare your thoughts with us via TRP\u2019s Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.", "keyword": ["wear", "patients", "quarantine", "heres", "guideline", "positive", "items", "asymptomatic", "mohs", "patient", "covid19", "health", "members", "household"], "summary": "If you\u2019re one of the few lucky ones to have enough space to safely quarantine at home, the Health Ministry recently tweeted a safety guideline for Covid-19 positive patients to undergo their quarantine period in the comfort of their own homes rather than at quarantine centres.\nOnce confirmed positive, they will provide a Monitoring and Observation Order and a quarantine band for positive patients staying at home.\nIf possible, other household members should also avoid sharing the same bathroom with the infected person.\nThe positive patient and other household members should wash their hands with soap and water or use hand sanitiser as frequently as possible.\nFrequently washing your hands will reduce the chances of your household members contracting the infection from you.", "news": "The Rakyat Post", "date": "2021-01-10 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "The yau char kwai man with a gun", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wMS8xMy90aGUteWF3LWNoYXIta3dhaS1tYW4td2l0aC1hLWd1bi_SAQA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/yau-char-kwai-n-sig-sauer-pistol-collage-130121-2.jpg", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: By day, he was selling the fried pastry cakoi or yau char kwai, which translates into oil-fried devil.

Sure, maybe instant noodles or spaghetti might be simple enough to whip up, but Malaysians need good \u2018ol Malaysian food to keep ourselves happy.\n\nBut Malaysian food, such as sambal belacan, is notoriously labourous and difficult, and you have no real cooking experience\u2026 is it possible?\n\nActually, the answer is yes. If someone else has already done all the hard parts of cooking for you.\n\nWe spoke to celebrity chef Sherson Lian, who gave us some tips and tricks on how to make an extremely simple Malaysia\u2019s favourite ikan sambal belacan with almost none of the labour that comes with it.\n\n3-Ingredient Ikan Sambal Belacan\n\nIngredients:\n\nIkan kembung (leatherjacket fish, readily available already cleaned, gutted, and descaled at grocery stores or at the fishmonger\u2019s)\n\nTumeric\n\nSalt\n\nPre-made sambal belacan paste\n\nBanana leaves (optional)\n\nFish, sambal belacan paste, and tumeric. That\u2019s all you need.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\nPreperation:\n\n1) Pat dry the fish. Cut two pockets on both sides along the fish\u2019s spine. (Chef\u2019s note: If you are having trouble with slicing through the flesh, try sharpening your knife. A dull knife can easily cause injuries to yourself.)\n\n2) Give the fish a generous tumeric rub to get rid of its fishy smell, including the insides of the pockets. Then, season it with a little salt.\n\nDo it like salt bae.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\n3) Scoop your sambal belacan paste into the pockets. Be generous with it, but most importantly, use a new clean and dry spoon in between the scoops as you do not want to contaminate the sambal paste.\n\nPockets are meant to be stuffed.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\n4) Heat up a pan to medium-high heat. If you have banana leaves, place it in the pan.\n\n5) Drizzle some oil over the fish. Then, place the fish in the pan.\n\nUse tongs to make it easier to handle the fish.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\n6) Flip the fish and ensure both sides are cooked. (Chef\u2019s note: Ikan kembung has thick skin, so the usual way to check if it\u2019s cooked by poking a fork into the meat won\u2019t work. Instead, check the eyes- they should turn completely white. However, you can leave it to cook a little longer if you\u2019re not sure as this fish is very forgiving to being overcooked.)\n\n7) Serve with rice and enjoy.\n\nA hot, piping meal is ready, all from the comfort of your own home.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\nSherson notes that sambal belacan is one of those sides that goes well with everything and every family has their own secret recipe. Still, it\u2019s a great beginner paste, and you can easily modify the recipe or use different kinds of protein to pair with the sambal belacan.\n\nIf you put the ikan sambal belacan on a fresh piece of bana leaf with some ceylon as garnish, you could even impress a date!\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\nThe one used here is from Sherson\u2019s line of Rencah pastes and condiments and is also used in his restaurants. The chili seeds are blended directly into the paste for a smoother taste and he adds thinly sliced calamansi skin for an extra hint of texture and fragrance.\n\nBut this recipe will work with any pre-prepared sambal belacan paste, you won\u2019t need to spend 4 hours making it from scratch.\n\nPS: Fish not quite your thing?

The implementation of halal certification is governed by the Trade Description Act and Orders related thereto.\n\nThe Act empowers Jakim as a competent authority in the issuance of the halal logo. This is rightly so, as an authority is required to guarantee that the products are genuinely halal in compliance with the Shariah principles. However, Jakim can only carry out inspections to ensure compliance. Any infringement may only result in the withdrawal of Jakim halal certificate. Jakim cannot exercise enforcement power, as the main player under the Act is the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP), while Jakim merely testifies as witnesses.\n\nFurthermore, the law does not impose an obligation that all foods are marked halal. Traders and manufacturers apply for certification voluntarily. If they choose not to apply but opt to forge certification, certainly Jakim could hardly be blamed. In the same way we do not blame Bank Negara for the forged currency floating, so too can we blame Jakim for the forged halal certification. Apart from KPDNHEP, the blame equally lies on the Customs, Royal Malaysia Police and local authorities who have halal execution power in their by-laws.\n\nThe consumption of halal food is a fundamental right of Muslims under the Constitution, yet as of today, our right to get halal food is not strictly guaranteed. The Malay Consultative Council should work towards that direction, rather than admonish a Muslim authority, albeit Jakim.\n\nOne unfortunate shortcoming of Jakim was their delayed reaction in \u201csetting the record straight\u201d. Unfortunately, the world is now \u201cforced\u201d to deal with the \u201cgame of perception\u201d. Keeping quiet, delayed response or failure to anticipate and manage negative perceptions may be at any organisation\u2019s detriment.\n\nThis is not the first time Jakim has been put under scrutiny for matters which were not directly under their purview. In this case, however, Jakim must understand that the word \u201chalal\u201d in itself will pull them into the \u201cfray\u201d regardless of their involvement.\n\nHence, Jakim should at least invest in effective communication and perception management team which would do them a lot of much-deserved justice.", "keyword": ["halal", "compliance", "authority", "scrutiny", "jakim", "pushing", "stop", "blame", "trade", "certification", "act", "food"], "summary": "The implementation of halal certification is governed by the Trade Description Act and Orders related thereto.\nThe Act empowers Jakim as a competent authority in the issuance of the halal logo.\nAny infringement may only result in the withdrawal of Jakim halal certificate.\nIn the same way we do not blame Bank Negara for the forged currency floating, so too can we blame Jakim for the forged halal certification.\nThe consumption of halal food is a fundamental right of Muslims under the Constitution, yet as of today, our right to get halal food is not strictly guaranteed.", "news": "The Malaysian Reserve", "date": "2021-01-07 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "MCO 2.0: Shopping malls can operate", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEG8IJUQ3Meh3UcdzzUFh9KUqGQgEKhAIACoHCAow9sveCjC0m9YBMPDtoQM?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/pogb18_NSTfield_image_socialmedia.var_1610506085.jpg", "text": "", "keyword": ["shopping", "operate", "malls", "mco", "20"], "summary": "", "news": "New Straits Times", "date": "2021-01-13 00:00:00", "language": "INDONESIA"}, {"title": "My Say: Halal meat fiasco begs a system overhaul", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWVkZ2VtYXJrZXRzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL215LXNheS1oYWxhbC1tZWF0LWZpYXNjby1iZWdzLXN5c3RlbS1vdmVyaGF1bNIBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://assets.theedgemarkets.com/Forum-Daging_20210111181717_theedgemarkets.jpg?KUEcITxU5mqfKqlzdYICPqyH.Bfx47eI", "text": "The imported halal meat fiasco has all the elemental components of a crime: smuggling; faking; a network of cheating syndicates, from the starting point to the consumer table; multinational actors to facilitate multiple functions at multiple points; and unchecked and unpunished, allegedly, for 40 years.\n\nIt is another corruption case that the public has to swallow. This time, the public is robbed of safe, genuine, quality and, to the Muslims, halal meat \u2014 a betrayal in all dimensions to consumers.\n\nThe case begs the question as to why it was left unchecked for such a long time. Logically, it means that it must have been well planned, tested and proven, or that the system is so weak that it failed to prevent such a serious situation.\n\nLet us look at the industry landscape that allows such a practice to breed. In 2018, the self-sufficiency level for meat stood at 22%, where the consumption per capita was 6.3kg per year, import value was RM3.8 billion and export value was RM1.2 billion, giving a trade deficit of RM2.6 billion. Similarly, related commodities such as milk and feedstock experienced a deficit of RM2.6 billion and RM10.2 billion respectively in 2018.\n\nThe data implies that, first, the demand for meat and milk is far greater than local supply, which has shown slow growth in the last five decades. Second, Malaysia depends on imported feedstock for her cows.\n\nThe agencies involved in monitoring the sector include the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP), Department of Veterinary Services (DVS), Jabatan Kemajuan Islam Malaysia (Jakim), Malaysian Quarantine and Inspection Services (Maqis), Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), the Royal Malaysian Customs Department (RMCD) and Port Police (PP).\n\nIn simple terms, the cartel uses fake halal certificates for meat from uncertified sources from the point of slaughter, either at the exporting country or at local warehouses, until it reaches consumers. The activities involved are acquisition, storing, processing, smuggling, manipulation, abetting and bringing into the country the non-certified frozen meat through approved import permits.\n\nThe real modus operandi involves a web of collaborative work of the cartel, suppliers, officials and traders both overseas and on the domestic scene. It is alleged that the first point of faking halal certificates may occur at slaughterhouses overseas, which have to get halal certification under the purview of Jakim and DVS. Once the cartel bypasses the first stage of inspection, the rest of the procedures are less of a hurdle.\n\nOnce the meat reaches the ports, the cartel again could move in smoothly with the help of \u201crepresentatives\u201d of very senior officials from government agencies working with it. Upon reaching the warehouses, the meat would be mixed with halal-certified meat and repacked with fake halal logos, then released to the market.\n\nThe supporting structure under which this malpractice takes place is described as follows.\n\nFirst, Malaysia is continuously dependent on meat imports (particularly beef and lamb), owing largely to growing demand, while local production shows the reverse trend. Local production is weak because of low productivity, high cost of production and inefficient small farms. These result in inflows of meat from efficient producers such as Australia, New Zealand and Argentina at relatively lower prices than local sources.\n\nSecond, arbitrage activities thrive when there is a big price gap between two locations. For instance, there are 124 illegal jetties in Kelantan where the black market or smuggling of goods and food commodities has been active for many decades. This occurs because the prices in Thailand are cheaper than in Malaysia. A similar analogy applies in the case of meat imports.\n\nThird, standards, sanitary and phytosanitary requirements and halal certification involve costs and disruption. As such, barriers \u2014 especially those that are messy and costly \u2014 incentivise traders to avoid or bypass the rules wherever possible. Some go to the extreme by violating the law and regulations, especially if the monitoring procedures are weak and ineffective.\n\nFourth, the import industry is oligopolistic in nature, where collusion among members is rampant, as proven in this case.\n\nFifth, it is highly probable that lowly paid government servants are drawn to receive bribes, especially when governance is weak, as proven by the alleged abuse that is said to have occurred for 40 years.\n\nSixth, with six agencies involved in monitoring meat imports, it is highly probable that there exists a redundancy of functions that deter efficiency. Seventh, non-governmental organisations and consumers that have the power to bring about change failed to sound the warning bell.\n\nThe convergence of these factors has led to the scandal being untouched by the law.\n\nWhat are the policy implications? Since this practice has taken root over a long time, no quick solution will undo it. While legal proceedings are a must, medium- and long-term structural changes must be instituted immediately.\n\nFirst, there is an urgent need for a deep inquiry into this matter in terms of the gap between standard operating procedures and reality, the major players that are responsible, the weakest links in the supply chain, the governance structure and the role of public agencies.\n\nSecond, there is an urgent need to increase local production through improvement in productivity and cost reduction. The livestock producers must be empowered with skills, knowledge and advanced technologies to improve production. Production cost can be reduced by using local materials such as palm kernel cake and other sources.\n\nThird, the farmers\u2019 cooperatives have to be strengthened to improve domestic production. Small farms find it hard to sustain production, owing to limited capital for investment but, through this vehicle, they may share resources and gain economies of scale.\n\nFourth, the National Feedlot Centre is not feasible, as it is highly centralised and has proved to be vulnerable to rent-seeking practices in the past. It can be replaced by support measures and incentives to encourage private abattoirs that are more competitive, run either by individuals or cooperatives.\n\nFifth, the cartel can be diffused by competition. The import sector should be opened up to more participants so that market control or any predatory move is checked by the competing participants.\n\nSixth, the data speaks the truth. Digitalisation of the supply chain may provide transactional transparency to all participants, hence minimising malpractices. Among the applications are blockchain, an information and communications technology solution whose distributed ledger technology allows data to be stored on servers. It creates secure, real-time communication networks with partners along the supply chain. The system makes it difficult for one user to gain control of, or game, the network.\n\nMaybe Malaysia is not ready for this, but the concept is of high utility. For a start, the country should focus on developing a complete database of who is doing what as well as their business profile. Data to be monitored is all the players\u2019 profiles, including overseas slaughter houses, in terms of production, quantity and quality traded, price, origin or source of meat, and prices. From the data one can detect irregularities such as a sudden increase in quantity or changes in prices or sources of origin. Such tracking may minimise malpractices along the supply chain. Once these databases are running well, then more sophisticated transaction apps such as blockchain may be considered.\n\nIn short, the issue of fake halal certificates is just a symptom of a deeper structural disease. This refers to a non-transparent procurement system, weak governance, oligopolistic import market and too many agencies involved, resulting in fragmented monitoring and attractive arbitrage opportunities, owing to low domestic production. It mirrors a systemic failure that requires a system overhaul.\n\nProf Datin Paduka Fatimah Mohamed Arshad is head of the agriculture and food security cluster at the Academy of Professors Malaysia.

Baru and See had betrayed the party by leaving PKR early last year and the departure of Baru had contributed to the downfall of the Pakatan Harapan (PH) federal government at the time.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference at the PKR Kuching and Stampin Branch office at Jalan Sin Sin Park here today, Ng admitted the state PKR had been weakened following the departure of the duo.\n\n\u201cHowever, it only makes us more determined to come back especially in the seats that these people won under PKR. The party is weakened, no doubt, but we will rise again in debacle.\n\n\u201cThey betrayed not only the party but contributed to the downfall of PH. We call them traitors. The party must learn from the setback,\u201d said the former Padungan assemblyman who served from 2006 to 2011.\n\nBaru and See contested and won in the 2016 state polls under the ticket of PKR, but they joined PSB late May last year, after being sacked by PKR following the collapse of the PH government.

It is best for Baru to explain to the public whether he was expelled or he left the party.\n\n\u201cHe should explain to the people, and not keeping quiet,\u201d he said, with Ng adding: \u201cOh, he described himself as a \u2018clever frog\u2019.\u201d\n\nJoshua, who has been with PKR since 2009, said Baru was not thrown out by the party.

for a policy to address birds\u2019 nests on electricity pylons or telecommunication towers.\n\nIn a statement today, MNS Terengganu said it was informed of an active white-bellied sea eagle nest on a telecommunication tower in Merang, Terengganu, which had newly-laid eggs but was \u201cdestroyed\u201d by the tower operators.\n\nThe eagles are classified as a totally protected species under the Wildlife Conservation Act 2010.\n\n\u201cThis is against the Wildlife Conservation Act 2010.\n\n\u201cRather than wait a few months for the family of eagles to raise their young, their future was abruptly terminated,\u201d MNS Terengganu chairman Wong Chee Ho said.\n\nNoting that the country currently lacks any policies on how to deal with nests on towers, Wong proposed a meeting with power company operators in Terengganu, as well as the telecommunication companies that use such towers, to formulate a statewide solution which would be the first for the country.\n\n\u201cWe want to create a new policy to better manage this problem in a way that protects wildlife and ensures the safety of all, including meeting the needs of the corporations and the services they provide.\n\n\u201cThe costs of monitoring all towers and keeping them nest-free is much more than the cost of supporting new and innovative ways of learning to live with the birds,\u201d he said.\n\nWong noted that while many eagles have traditionally constructed their nests on tall trees, more of them are using man-made structures instead.\n\nApart from being taller than many of the surrounding trees and giving birds of prey a better vantage point to survey their territory, such structures are also sturdy and able to support large nests.\n\nWith the expansion of electricity distribution over the past century, and the more recent surge in telecommunication towers, more birds are choosing man-made structures to build their nests.\n\nHowever, nesting birds are known to have disrupted electricity and telecommunication services provided through the towers, while nests made of dry wood and grass can cause fires which lead to service loss for the public and expensive repairs for the companies involved.\n\nPointing out that birds like the white-bellied sea eagle are territorial, Wong said once they have selected a site to nest, they will return to it year after year and rebuild even if their nests are removed.\n\nWhile he admitted some nests will have to be removed as they pose a threat to the company and the birds themselves, Wong stressed the need for a policy on nest removal that does not destroy wildlife.\n\n\u201cPower and telecommunication companies need to explore other ways to resolve this conflict,\u201d he said, suggesting a few solutions that could be

The Yuet Wan is likely the only group still active in Malaysia,\u201d he told theSun.\n\nLeong lays the blame partly on the failure to instil a love for the art among the younger people.\n\nAs a young man practising an age-old art, he is a rarity. He still dons the full regalia for the occasional performance.\n\nLeong laments the fact that many sifus, or masters of the art form, have not been able to find sufficient interest among the younger generation to whom they can pass on their skills.\n\nOpera, Leong pointed out, is an art form that takes years to learn and even longer to perfect. Another setback is the high cost of the costumes.\n\n\u201cOur costumes cost thousands of ringgit, but we do not earn enough to cover even a fraction of that,\u201d he added.\n\nA three-night performance today would bring barely RM400 to the table. But the destroyer of the opera may yet be its saviour.\n\nLeong is looking to new technology to advance a bold plan \u2013 to give Cantonese opera a revival. He has assembled a troupe of 10 young social media wizards to advance his plan.\n\n\u201cThe young participants have paved more paths for better exposure of Cantonese opera through Facebook and Instagram,\u201d he said.\n\nMany challenges remain.\n\n\u201cFor instance, there are not enough musically-talented people who are interested in opera,\u201d he said.\n\nLeong, who has been pursuing his love for the art with the association since 2016, said the immediate priority is to find a new set of talents who can play traditional Chinese musical instruments.\n\n\u201cWe strive for authenticity so we don\u2019t use pre-recorded music for our shows. We still rely on older members to provide the music but we need younger people to take over,\u201d he said.\n\nLots of practice is essential, as the association\u2019s long-time sifu Yoong Poo Hiong pointed out. \u201cShe often reminds us to follow her teachings closely so we may pass on the \u2018full package\u2019 to the next generation. This is a life-long learning experience.\u201d\n\nLeong still harbours hopes that more young people will be drawn to the art.\n\n\u201cI would like to see the Cantonese opera recognised as a Malaysian art form although it originates in China.\n\n\u201cThe Tourism, Arts and Culture Ministry should look into rekindling dying arts and traditions such as ours to boost tourism.

MOH Explains What Happens\n\n1. Get in touch with your district health office\n\nIf you suspect you have contracted the illness, get yourself tested. If you have already tested positive, the Health Ministry\u2019s tweet says that the district health office will contact patients to undergo Covid-19 swab tests.\n\nOnce confirmed positive, they will provide a Monitoring and Observation Order and a quarantine band for positive patients staying at home.\n\n2. The positive patient will need to stay at home for 10 days\n\nQuarantine at home will mean that you won\u2019t be allowed to leave your house for any reason for the period of 10 days.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) also advises that you avoid having visitors over and that they should not interact with the patient under any circumstances.\n\n3. The positive patient should not share a room with any other household members\n\nEven though still at home, you\u2019ll have to separate yourself from the rest of your household to avoid accidentally infecting them. (Credit: Unsplash)\n\nUnless this is possible, home quarantine shouldn\u2019t be your first choice.\n\nA separate room with adequate ventilation should be allocated for the patient. Other household members should stay and sleep in another room and be separated from the patient at all times.\n\nIf possible, other household members should also avoid sharing the same bathroom with the infected person. If you have no choice, WHO advises that taps, doorknobs, and other items are cleaned regularly with soap and water.\n\n4. Household members will have to always wear a face mask and maintain 1 \u2013 2 meters of physical distance from the patient\n\nYes, if you are positive and choose to quarantine at home, your other household members will have to constantly wear a face mask while at home. You must also constantly maintain a physical distance from them to avoid getting them infected as well.\n\n5. Meals, drinks and other essential items should be placed outside the patient\u2019s room door to be taken by themselves\n\nYou and your household members will need to constantly wear a mask while at home during your quarantine period and maintain physical distance from you at all times. (Credit: Unsplash)\n\nPractice contactless delivery when passing food and other essential items to the patient to minimise physical contact between the positive individuals and other members of the household.\n\n6. Other household members will need to wear gloves when handling items used by the positive patient.\n\nWhen handling items used by the infected individual, such as plates, cups, and eating utensils, household members will need to wear disposable gloves.\n\nAfter use, the gloves should be properly discarded without reuse, preferably in a closed container.\n\nWHO advises that separate dishes, cups, eating utensils, bedding, towels, and other essential items be assigned for the infected person.\n\nBeddings, towels, and clothes used by the infected person should be washed with soap and water separately from those used by the rest of the household.\n\n7. The positive patient and other household members should wash their hands with soap and water or use hand sanitiser as frequently as possible.\n\nFrequently washing your hands will reduce the chances of your household members contracting the infection from you.\n\nWash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds at a time and use alcohol-based hand sanitiser when you don\u2019t have the immediate option of using water and soap.\n\nHousehold members should also avoid touching their eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.\n\n8.

Sure, maybe instant noodles or spaghetti might be simple enough to whip up, but Malaysians need good \u2018ol Malaysian food to keep ourselves happy.\n\nBut Malaysian food, such as sambal belacan, is notoriously labourous and difficult, and you have no real cooking experience\u2026 is it possible?\n\nActually, the answer is yes. If someone else has already done all the hard parts of cooking for you.\n\nWe spoke to celebrity chef Sherson Lian, who gave us some tips and tricks on how to make an extremely simple Malaysia\u2019s favourite ikan sambal belacan with almost none of the labour that comes with it.\n\n3-Ingredient Ikan Sambal Belacan\n\nIngredients:\n\nIkan kembung (leatherjacket fish, readily available already cleaned, gutted, and descaled at grocery stores or at the fishmonger\u2019s)\n\nTumeric\n\nSalt\n\nPre-made sambal belacan paste\n\nBanana leaves (optional)\n\nFish, sambal belacan paste, and tumeric. That\u2019s all you need.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\nPreperation:\n\n1) Pat dry the fish. Cut two pockets on both sides along the fish\u2019s spine. (Chef\u2019s note: If you are having trouble with slicing through the flesh, try sharpening your knife. A dull knife can easily cause injuries to yourself.)\n\n2) Give the fish a generous tumeric rub to get rid of its fishy smell, including the insides of the pockets. Then, season it with a little salt.\n\nDo it like salt bae.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\n3) Scoop your sambal belacan paste into the pockets. Be generous with it, but most importantly, use a new clean and dry spoon in between the scoops as you do not want to contaminate the sambal paste.\n\nPockets are meant to be stuffed.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\n4) Heat up a pan to medium-high heat. If you have banana leaves, place it in the pan.\n\n5) Drizzle some oil over the fish. Then, place the fish in the pan.\n\nUse tongs to make it easier to handle the fish.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\n6) Flip the fish and ensure both sides are cooked. (Chef\u2019s note: Ikan kembung has thick skin, so the usual way to check if it\u2019s cooked by poking a fork into the meat won\u2019t work. Instead, check the eyes- they should turn completely white. However, you can leave it to cook a little longer if you\u2019re not sure as this fish is very forgiving to being overcooked.)\n\n7) Serve with rice and enjoy.\n\nA hot, piping meal is ready, all from the comfort of your own home.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\nSherson notes that sambal belacan is one of those sides that goes well with everything and every family has their own secret recipe. Still, it\u2019s a great beginner paste, and you can easily modify the recipe or use different kinds of protein to pair with the sambal belacan.\n\nIf you put the ikan sambal belacan on a fresh piece of bana leaf with some ceylon as garnish, you could even impress a date!\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\nThe one used here is from Sherson\u2019s line of Rencah pastes and condiments and is also used in his restaurants.

The implementation of halal certification is governed by the Trade Description Act and Orders related thereto.\n\nThe Act empowers Jakim as a competent authority in the issuance of the halal logo. This is rightly so, as an authority is required to guarantee that the products are genuinely halal in compliance with the Shariah principles. However, Jakim can only carry out inspections to ensure compliance. Any infringement may only result in the withdrawal of Jakim halal certificate. Jakim cannot exercise enforcement power, as the main player under the Act is the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP), while Jakim merely testifies as witnesses.\n\nFurthermore, the law does not impose an obligation that all foods are marked halal. Traders and manufacturers apply for certification voluntarily. If they choose not to apply but opt to forge certification, certainly Jakim could hardly be blamed. In the same way we do not blame Bank Negara for the forged currency floating, so too can we blame Jakim for the forged halal certification. Apart from KPDNHEP, the blame equally lies on the Customs, Royal Malaysia Police and local authorities who have halal execution power in their by-laws.\n\nThe consumption of halal food is a fundamental right of Muslims under the Constitution, yet as of today, our right to get halal food is not strictly guaranteed. The Malay Consultative Council should work towards that direction, rather than admonish a Muslim authority, albeit Jakim.\n\nOne unfortunate shortcoming of Jakim was their delayed reaction in \u201csetting the record straight\u201d. Unfortunately, the world is now \u201cforced\u201d to deal with the \u201cgame of perception\u201d. Keeping quiet, delayed response or failure to anticipate and manage negative perceptions may be at any organisation\u2019s detriment.\n\nThis is not the first time Jakim has been put under scrutiny for matters which were not directly under their purview. In this case, however, Jakim must understand that the word \u201chalal\u201d in itself will pull them into the \u201cfray\u201d regardless of their involvement.\n\nHence, Jakim should at least invest in effective communication and perception management team which would do them a lot of much-deserved justice.", "keyword": ["halal", "compliance", "authority", "scrutiny", "jakim", "pushing", "stop", "blame", "trade", "certification", "act", "food"], "summary": "The implementation of halal certification is governed by the Trade Description Act and Orders related thereto.\nThe Act empowers Jakim as a competent authority in the issuance of the halal logo.\nAny infringement may only result in the withdrawal of Jakim halal certificate.\nIn the same way we do not blame Bank Negara for the forged currency floating, so too can we blame Jakim for the forged halal certification.\nThe consumption of halal food is a fundamental right of Muslims under the Constitution, yet as of today, our right to get halal food is not strictly guaranteed.", "news": "The Malaysian Reserve", "date": "2021-01-07 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "MCO 2.0: Shopping malls can operate", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEG8IJUQ3Meh3UcdzzUFh9KUqGQgEKhAIACoHCAow9sveCjC0m9YBMPDtoQM?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/pogb18_NSTfield_image_socialmedia.var_1610506085.jpg", "text": "", "keyword": ["shopping", "operate", "malls", "mco", "20"], "summary": "", "news": "New Straits Times", "date": "2021-01-13 00:00:00", "language": "INDONESIA"}, {"title": "My Say: Halal meat fiasco begs a system overhaul", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWVkZ2VtYXJrZXRzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL215LXNheS1oYWxhbC1tZWF0LWZpYXNjby1iZWdzLXN5c3RlbS1vdmVyaGF1bNIBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://assets.theedgemarkets.com/Forum-Daging_20210111181717_theedgemarkets.jpg?KUEcITxU5mqfKqlzdYICPqyH.Bfx47eI", "text": "The imported halal meat fiasco has all the elemental components of a crime: smuggling; faking; a network of cheating syndicates, from the starting point to the consumer table; multinational actors to facilitate multiple functions at multiple points; and unchecked and unpunished, allegedly, for 40 years.\n\nIt is another corruption case that the public has to swallow. This time, the public is robbed of safe, genuine, quality and, to the Muslims, halal meat \u2014 a betrayal in all dimensions to consumers.\n\nThe case begs the question as to why it was left unchecked for such a long time. Logically, it means that it must have been well planned, tested and proven, or that the system is so weak that it failed to prevent such a serious situation.\n\nLet us look at the industry landscape that allows such a practice to breed. In 2018, the self-sufficiency level for meat stood at 22%, where the consumption per capita was 6.3kg per year, import value was RM3.8 billion and export value was RM1.2 billion, giving a trade deficit of RM2.6 billion. Similarly, related commodities such as milk and feedstock experienced a deficit of RM2.6 billion and RM10.2 billion respectively in 2018.\n\nThe data implies that, first, the demand for meat and milk is far greater than local supply, which has shown slow growth in the last five decades. Second, Malaysia depends on imported feedstock for her cows.\n\nThe agencies involved in monitoring the sector include the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP), Department of Veterinary Services (DVS), Jabatan Kemajuan Islam Malaysia (Jakim), Malaysian Quarantine and Inspection Services (Maqis), Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), the Royal Malaysian Customs Department (RMCD) and Port Police (PP).\n\nIn simple terms, the cartel uses fake halal certificates for meat from uncertified sources from the point of slaughter, either at the exporting country or at local warehouses, until it reaches consumers. The activities involved are acquisition, storing, processing, smuggling, manipulation, abetting and bringing into the country the non-certified frozen meat through approved import permits.\n\nThe real modus operandi involves a web of collaborative work of the cartel, suppliers, officials and traders both overseas and on the domestic scene. It is alleged that the first point of faking halal certificates may occur at slaughterhouses overseas, which have to get halal certification under the purview of Jakim and DVS. Once the cartel bypasses the first stage of inspection, the rest of the procedures are less of a hurdle.\n\nOnce the meat reaches the ports, the cartel again could move in smoothly with the help of \u201crepresentatives\u201d of very senior officials from government agencies working with it. Upon reaching the warehouses, the meat would be mixed with halal-certified meat and repacked with fake halal logos, then released to the market.\n\nThe supporting structure under which this malpractice takes place is described as follows.\n\nFirst, Malaysia is continuously dependent on meat imports (particularly beef and lamb), owing largely to growing demand, while local production shows the reverse trend. Local production is weak because of low productivity, high cost of production and inefficient small farms. These result in inflows of meat from efficient producers such as Australia, New Zealand and Argentina at relatively lower prices than local sources.\n\nSecond, arbitrage activities thrive when there is a big price gap between two locations. For instance, there are 124 illegal jetties in Kelantan where the black market or smuggling of goods and food commodities has been active for many decades. This occurs because the prices in Thailand are cheaper than in Malaysia. A similar analogy applies in the case of meat imports.\n\nThird, standards, sanitary and phytosanitary requirements and halal certification involve costs and disruption. As such, barriers \u2014 especially those that are messy and costly \u2014 incentivise traders to avoid or bypass the rules wherever possible. Some go to the extreme by violating the law and regulations, especially if the monitoring procedures are weak and ineffective.\n\nFourth, the import industry is oligopolistic in nature, where collusion among members is rampant, as proven in this case.\n\nFifth, it is highly probable that lowly paid government servants are drawn to receive bribes, especially when governance is weak, as proven by the alleged abuse that is said to have occurred for 40 years.\n\nSixth, with six agencies involved in monitoring meat imports, it is highly probable that there exists a redundancy of functions that deter efficiency. Seventh, non-governmental organisations and consumers that have the power to bring about change failed to sound the warning bell.\n\nThe convergence of these factors has led to the scandal being untouched by the law.\n\nWhat are the policy implications? Since this practice has taken root over a long time, no quick solution will undo it. While legal proceedings are a must, medium- and long-term structural changes must be instituted immediately.\n\nFirst, there is an urgent need for a deep inquiry into this matter in terms of the gap between standard operating procedures and reality, the major players that are responsible, the weakest links in the supply chain, the governance structure and the role of public agencies.\n\nSecond, there is an urgent need to increase local production through improvement in productivity and cost reduction. The livestock producers must be empowered with skills, knowledge and advanced technologies to improve production. Production cost can be reduced by using local materials such as palm kernel cake and other sources.\n\nThird, the farmers\u2019 cooperatives have to be strengthened to improve domestic production. Small farms find it hard to sustain production, owing to limited capital for investment but, through this vehicle, they may share resources and gain economies of scale.\n\nFourth, the National Feedlot Centre is not feasible, as it is highly centralised and has proved to be vulnerable to rent-seeking practices in the past. It can be replaced by support measures and incentives to encourage private abattoirs that are more competitive, run either by individuals or cooperatives.\n\nFifth, the cartel can be diffused by competition. The import sector should be opened up to more participants so that market control or any predatory move is checked by the competing participants.\n\nSixth, the data speaks the truth. Digitalisation of the supply chain may provide transactional transparency to all participants, hence minimising malpractices. Among the applications are blockchain, an information and communications technology solution whose distributed ledger technology allows data to be stored on servers. It creates secure, real-time communication networks with partners along the supply chain. The system makes it difficult for one user to gain control of, or game, the network.\n\nMaybe Malaysia is not ready for this, but the concept is of high utility. For a start, the country should focus on developing a complete database of who is doing what as well as their business profile. Data to be monitored is all the players\u2019 profiles, including overseas slaughter houses, in terms of production, quantity and quality traded, price, origin or source of meat, and prices. From the data one can detect irregularities such as a sudden increase in quantity or changes in prices or sources of origin. Such tracking may minimise malpractices along the supply chain. Once these databases are running well, then more sophisticated transaction apps such as blockchain may be considered.\n\nIn short, the issue of fake halal certificates is just a symptom of a deeper structural disease. This refers to a non-transparent procurement system, weak governance, oligopolistic import market and too many agencies involved, resulting in fragmented monitoring and attractive arbitrage opportunities, owing to low domestic production.

simple, clear SOPs for the public to follow.\n\nChan, who is also the secretary of Democratic Action Party (DAP) Sabah, opined that the business sectors that were allowed to operate during MCO could be determined by common sense, whereas the sectors or services that were prohibited from opening should comply with the directive.\n\nFor instance, night markets, reflexologies, spa, hair salons, optical shops, boutiques, sports and recreational activities (except for jogging limited to two persons from the same household and cycling), mass gatherings, tourism activities, tuition classes, music classes, dance classes, language classes, entertainment outlets, indoor playground, karaoke outlets, cinemas, meetings, seminars, exhibitions, wedding banquets, birthdays and interstate and inter-district travels were banned unless in emergency situation, while employees in essential sectors must show their work pass or employer\u2019s authorization letter.\n\nHe said the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) has issued a statement on Tuesday detailing the permitted activities under the trade and distribution sector, which included shopping malls, supermarkets and hypermarkets, departmental stores, pharmacies, convenience stores, laundry shops (excluding self-service), restaurants, furniture shops, jewellery stores, electric and electronics stores,

Malaysian Islamic Development Department (Jakim).A raid on the factory was done after one month of surveillance, the department's director Muhamad Zikri Azan Abdullah said.\n\"The company\u2019s halal logo issued by Jakim was cancelled on Oct 28 last year, on the grounds that the company had failed to observe the halal compliance requirements especially pertaining to the cleanliness of the premises.\u201cDuring the raid, the company\u2019s representative also informed that they had made an appeal regarding the withdrawal of the halal certificate, but this was rejected as the company failed to act on the religious department\u2019s instructions within the stipulated period,\" he reportedly said.The authorities are investigating the case under Paragraph 4 of the Trade Descriptions (Definition of Halal) Order 2011 and Regulation 4 of the Trade Descriptions (Certification and Marking of Halal) Order 2011.It's really not that easy to get Halal certification and it's more than just the meat used in a product.Besides using only halal mean for production and in a premise, there are other requirements that a company has to meet to get the certification.One of it is cleanliness, which this particular noodle company seem to have neglected.According to Malaysian Halal Certification Procedure Manual , in order to get a Halal certification, a company \"during preparation, handling, processing, packaging, storage or transfer of products, they shall be in compliance to requirements by the Shariah law and remain clean as well as comply to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP)/ Good Hygienic Practices (GHP)\", among other things.Other provision regarding cleanliness in the manual includes:You can see the full list of requirements to get a Halal certification here",

Ba Kelalan assemblyman Baru Bian and Batu Lintang assemblyman See Chee How \u2018traitors\u2019 for joining Parti Sarawak Bersatu (PSB) last year.\n\nIts Kuching branch chief Dominique Ng said both Baru and See had betrayed the party by leaving PKR early last year and the departure of Baru had contributed to the downfall of the Pakatan Harapan (PH) federal government at the time.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference at the PKR Kuching and Stampin Branch office at Jalan Sin Sin Park here today, Ng admitted the state PKR had been weakened following the departure of the duo.\n\n\u201cHowever, it only makes us more determined to come back especially in the seats that these people won under PKR. The party is weakened, no doubt, but we will rise again in debacle.\n\n\u201cThey betrayed not only the party but contributed to the downfall of PH. We call them traitors. The party must learn from the setback,\u201d said the former Padungan assemblyman who served from 2006 to 2011.\n\nBaru and See contested and won in the 2016 state polls under the ticket of PKR, but they joined PSB late May last year, after being sacked by PKR following the collapse of the PH government. Baru, who is Selangau MP, is former Works Minister.\n\nState PKR secretary Joshua Jabeng, who was also present, said the party noted that political analysts and even the media had dubbed PKR as \u201ca gone case\u201d given the departure of Baru and See.\n\n\u201cPolitical scientists and the media have been running us down. Some even said PKR expelled them. It is best for Baru to explain to the public whether he was expelled or he left the party.\n\n\u201cHe should explain to the people, and not keeping quiet,\u201d he said, with Ng adding: \u201cOh, he described himself as a \u2018clever frog\u2019.\u201d\n\nJoshua, who has been with PKR since 2009, said Baru was not thrown out by the party. He even recalled that he \u201cstepped aside in Selangau\u201d for Baru to stand.\n\n\u201cMy heart is so big. He\u2019d been the state chief.

for a policy to address birds\u2019 nests on electricity pylons or telecommunication towers.\n\nIn a statement today, MNS Terengganu said it was informed of an active white-bellied sea eagle nest on a telecommunication tower in Merang, Terengganu, which had newly-laid eggs but was \u201cdestroyed\u201d by the tower operators.\n\nThe eagles are classified as a totally protected species under the Wildlife Conservation Act 2010.\n\n\u201cThis is against the Wildlife Conservation Act 2010.\n\n\u201cRather than wait a few months for the family of eagles to raise their young, their future was abruptly terminated,\u201d MNS Terengganu chairman Wong Chee Ho said.\n\nNoting that the country currently lacks any policies on how to deal with nests on towers, Wong proposed a meeting with power company operators in Terengganu, as well as the telecommunication companies that use such towers, to formulate a statewide solution which would be the first for the country.\n\n\u201cWe want to create a new policy to better manage this problem in a way that protects wildlife and ensures the safety of all, including meeting the needs of the corporations and the services they provide.\n\n\u201cThe costs of monitoring all towers and keeping them nest-free is much more than the cost of supporting new and innovative ways of learning to live with the birds,\u201d he said.\n\nWong noted that while many eagles have traditionally constructed their nests on tall trees, more of them are using man-made structures instead.\n\nApart from being taller than many of the surrounding trees and giving birds of prey a better vantage point to survey their territory, such structures are also sturdy and able to support large nests.\n\nWith the expansion of electricity distribution over the past century, and the more recent surge in telecommunication towers, more birds are choosing man-made structures to build their nests.\n\nHowever, nesting birds are known to have disrupted electricity and telecommunication services provided through the towers, while nests made of dry wood and grass can cause fires which lead to service loss for the public and expensive repairs for the companies involved.\n\nPointing out that birds like the white-bellied sea eagle are territorial, Wong said once they have selected a site to nest, they will return to it year after year and rebuild even if their nests are removed.\n\nWhile he admitted some nests will have to be removed as they pose a threat to the company and the birds themselves, Wong stressed the need for a policy on nest removal that does not destroy wildlife.\n\n\u201cPower and telecommunication companies need to explore other ways to resolve this conflict,\u201d he said, suggesting a few solutions that could be incorporated.\n\n\u201cOne solution could be adding a platform to the towers, placed in a safe location, and made suitable for birds of prey to use as nesting platforms.\n\n\u201cCameras could be installed to record video of the nesting birds. This video could be shared as a live feed to generate interest among the public and showcase conservation activities of the corporations involved.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["nesting", "terengganu", "towers", "structures", "wildlife", "policy", "birds", "regrets", "eagles", "telecommunication", "nature", "nests", "removal", "rare", "telco", "nest", "group", "tower"], "summary": "PETALING JAYA: The Malaysian Nature Society (MNS) has called for a policy to address birds\u2019 nests on electricity pylons or telecommunication towers.\nIn a statement today, MNS Terengganu said it was informed of an active white-bellied sea eagle nest on a telecommunication tower in Merang, Terengganu, which had newly-laid eggs but was \u201cdestroyed\u201d by the tower operators.\nThe eagles are classified as a totally protected species under the Wildlife Conservation Act 2010.\nWong noted that while many eagles have traditionally constructed their nests on tall trees, more of them are using man-made structures instead.\n\u201cCameras could be installed to record video of the nesting birds.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-01-11 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Breathing new life into dying art form", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN1bmRhaWx5Lm15L2xvY2FsL2JyZWF0aGluZy1uZXctbGlmZS1pbnRvLWR5aW5nLWFydC1mb3JtLUFGNjA0Mzk5MtIBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://www.thesundaily.my/binrepository/480x320/0c6/480d250/none/11808/NOOF/image-1981530_1983190_20210111114043.jpg", "text": "BACK when the web was what spiders spun and the TV was in black and white, the Chinese opera was the entertainment that drew large crowds.\n\nToday, such performances are staged only occasionally, mostly on significant dates such as the Hungry Ghost Festival.\n\nFor the younger generation, who have unlimited entertainment options thanks to new technology, sitting in the moonlight for a\n\nthree-hour stage retelling of palace intrigue or lost love is no longer as magical.\n\nBut, if Chinese opera enthusiast Daryl Leong, 43, has his way, the lost art may yet get a revival, thanks to technology.\n\nIn Malaysia, the Chinese opera, in various dialects such as Cantonese, Teochew and Hokkien, had its hey day in the 1920s and 1930s,\n\nwhen several troupes travelled across the country to perform for eager fans.\n\nHowever, the number of local troupes eventually dwindled, replaced mostly by those from Thailand, particularly for performances in the Teochew dialect.\n\nAccording to Leong, who is chief secretary of the Yuet Wan Cantonese Opera Association Kuala Lumpur, urbanisation and globalisation also led to a decline, and eventual demise, of the opera.\n\n\u201cMany associations folded up when their opera troupes could not keep up with the times. The Yuet Wan is likely the only group still active in Malaysia,\u201d he told theSun.\n\nLeong lays the blame partly on the failure to instil a love for the art among the younger people.\n\nAs a young man practising an age-old art, he is a rarity. He still dons the full regalia for the occasional performance.\n\nLeong laments the fact that many sifus, or masters of the art form, have not been able to find sufficient interest among the younger generation to whom they can pass on their skills.\n\nOpera, Leong pointed out, is an art form that takes years to learn and even longer to perfect. Another setback is the high cost of the costumes.\n\n\u201cOur costumes cost thousands of ringgit, but we do not earn enough to cover even a fraction of that,\u201d he added.\n\nA three-night performance today would bring barely RM400 to the table. But the destroyer of the opera may yet be its saviour.\n\nLeong is looking to new technology to advance a bold plan \u2013 to give Cantonese opera a revival. He has assembled a troupe of 10 young social media wizards to advance his plan.\n\n\u201cThe young participants have paved more paths for better exposure of Cantonese opera through Facebook and Instagram,\u201d he said.\n\nMany challenges remain.\n\n\u201cFor instance, there are not enough musically-talented people who are interested in opera,\u201d he said.\n\nLeong, who has been pursuing his love for the art with the association since 2016, said the immediate priority is to find a new set of talents who can play traditional Chinese musical instruments.\n\n\u201cWe strive for authenticity so we don\u2019t use pre-recorded music for our shows. We still rely on older members to provide the music but we need younger people to take over,\u201d he said.\n\nLots of practice is essential, as the association\u2019s long-time sifu Yoong Poo Hiong pointed out. \u201cShe often reminds us to follow her teachings closely so we may pass on the \u2018full package\u2019 to the next generation. This is a life-long learning experience.\u201d\n\nLeong still harbours hopes that more young people will be drawn to the art.\n\n\u201cI would like to see the Cantonese opera recognised as a Malaysian art form although it originates in China.\n\n\u201cThe Tourism, Arts and Culture Ministry should look into rekindling dying arts and traditions such as ours to boost tourism.

The positive patient will need to stay at home for 10 days\n\nQuarantine at home will mean that you won\u2019t be allowed to leave your house for any reason for the period of 10 days.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) also advises that you avoid having visitors over and that they should not interact with the patient under any circumstances.\n\n3. The positive patient should not share a room with any other household members\n\nEven though still at home, you\u2019ll have to separate yourself from the rest of your household to avoid accidentally infecting them. (Credit: Unsplash)\n\nUnless this is possible, home quarantine shouldn\u2019t be your first choice.\n\nA separate room with adequate ventilation should be allocated for the patient. Other household members should stay and sleep in another room and be separated from the patient at all times.\n\nIf possible, other household members should also avoid sharing the same bathroom with the infected person. If you have no choice, WHO advises that taps, doorknobs, and other items are cleaned regularly with soap and water.\n\n4. Household members will have to always wear a face mask and maintain 1 \u2013 2 meters of physical distance from the patient\n\nYes, if you are positive and choose to quarantine at home, your other household members will have to constantly wear a face mask while at home.

Sure, maybe instant noodles or spaghetti might be simple enough to whip up, but Malaysians need good \u2018ol Malaysian food to keep ourselves happy.\n\nBut Malaysian food, such as sambal belacan, is notoriously labourous and difficult, and you have no real cooking experience\u2026 is it possible?\n\nActually, the answer is yes. If someone else has already done all the hard parts of cooking for you.\n\nWe spoke to celebrity chef Sherson Lian, who gave us some tips and tricks on how to make an extremely simple Malaysia\u2019s favourite ikan sambal belacan with almost none of the labour that comes with it.\n\n3-Ingredient Ikan Sambal Belacan\n\nIngredients:\n\nIkan kembung (leatherjacket fish, readily available already cleaned, gutted, and descaled at grocery stores or at the fishmonger\u2019s)\n\nTumeric\n\nSalt\n\nPre-made sambal belacan paste\n\nBanana leaves (optional)\n\nFish, sambal belacan paste, and tumeric. That\u2019s all you need.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\nPreperation:\n\n1) Pat dry the fish. Cut two pockets on both sides along the fish\u2019s spine. (Chef\u2019s note: If you are having trouble with slicing through the flesh, try sharpening your knife. A dull knife can easily cause injuries to yourself.)\n\n2) Give the fish a generous tumeric rub to get rid of its fishy smell, including the insides of the pockets. Then, season it with a little salt.\n\nDo it like salt bae.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\n3) Scoop your sambal belacan paste into the pockets. Be generous with it, but most importantly, use a new clean and dry spoon in between the scoops as you do not want to contaminate the sambal paste.\n\nPockets are meant to be stuffed.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\n4) Heat up a pan to medium-high heat. If you have banana leaves, place it in the pan.\n\n5) Drizzle some oil over the fish. Then, place the fish in the pan.\n\nUse tongs to make it easier to handle the fish.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\n6) Flip the fish and ensure both sides are cooked. (Chef\u2019s note: Ikan kembung has thick skin, so the usual way to check if it\u2019s cooked by poking a fork into the meat won\u2019t work. Instead, check the eyes- they should turn completely white. However, you can leave it to cook a little longer if you\u2019re not sure as this fish is very forgiving to being overcooked.)\n\n7) Serve with rice and enjoy.\n\nA hot, piping meal is ready, all from the comfort of your own home.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\nSherson notes that sambal belacan is one of those sides that goes well with everything and every family has their own secret recipe. Still, it\u2019s a great beginner paste, and you can easily modify the recipe or use different kinds of protein to pair with the sambal belacan.\n\nIf you put the ikan sambal belacan on a fresh piece of bana leaf with some ceylon as garnish, you could even impress a date!\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\nThe one used here is from Sherson\u2019s line of Rencah pastes and condiments and is also used in his restaurants. The chili seeds are blended directly into the paste for a smoother taste and he adds thinly sliced calamansi skin for an extra hint of texture and fragrance.\n\nBut this recipe will work with any pre-prepared sambal belacan paste, you won\u2019t need to spend 4 hours making it from scratch.\n\nPS: Fish not quite your thing?

Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) will be spending RM200 million for the distribution of essential items, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and community drumming programme for rural areas this year.\n\nThe ministry has identified 137 new distribution areas, including islands such as Pulau Tioman, Pulau Perhentian and Pulau Redang in Terengganu and Pahang.\n\nThe ministry said several new areas in Sabah and Sarawak have also been identified for the programme.\n\n\u201cFor 2021, the government has approved an allocation of RM200 million for the programme, which is an increase of RM50 million or 33% compared to last year\u2019s RM150 million.\n\n\u201cThe increment in the allocation allows the ministry to expand the distribution to new areas in need,\u201d it said in a statement yesterday.\n\nFrom its observation, KPDNHEP said people who are living in rural areas have to pay higher prices for essential goods compared to people living in urban areas due to the additional transportation cost.\n\n\u201cIt is due to the high cost of transportation as logistics providers have to travel a long distance to remote areas and through difficult roads, such as logging roads, rivers and rapids,\u201d the ministry said.\n\nIt added that poor connection among infrastructure facilities and various terrain structures such as hills, mountains and islands also contribute to the high transportation costs.\n\nThe programme, which started in 2009, has managed to help the rural community have better access to basic goods like rice, sugar, flour, cooking oil, LPG, RON95 petrol and diesel at controlled prices.\n\n\u201cDistribution of the necessities is carried out by appointed transporters, who buy from trusted suppliers in the city, and send and sell the items to point of

The implementation of halal certification is governed by the Trade Description Act and Orders related thereto.\n\nThe Act empowers Jakim as a competent authority in the issuance of the halal logo. This is rightly so, as an authority is required to guarantee that the products are genuinely halal in compliance with the Shariah principles. However, Jakim can only carry out inspections to ensure compliance. Any infringement may only result in the withdrawal of Jakim halal certificate. Jakim cannot exercise enforcement power, as the main player under the Act is the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP), while Jakim merely testifies as witnesses.\n\nFurthermore, the law does not impose an obligation that all foods are marked halal. Traders and manufacturers apply for certification voluntarily. If they choose not to apply but opt to forge certification, certainly Jakim could hardly be blamed. In the same way we do not blame Bank Negara for the forged currency floating, so too can we blame Jakim for the forged halal certification. Apart from KPDNHEP, the blame equally lies on the Customs, Royal Malaysia Police and local authorities who have halal execution power in their by-laws.\n\nThe consumption of halal food is a fundamental right of Muslims under the Constitution, yet as of today, our right to get halal food is not strictly guaranteed. The Malay Consultative Council should work towards that direction, rather than admonish a Muslim authority, albeit Jakim.\n\nOne unfortunate shortcoming of Jakim was their delayed reaction in \u201csetting the record straight\u201d.

This time, the public is robbed of safe, genuine, quality and, to the Muslims, halal meat \u2014 a betrayal in all dimensions to consumers.\n\nThe case begs the question as to why it was left unchecked for such a long time. Logically, it means that it must have been well planned, tested and proven, or that the system is so weak that it failed to prevent such a serious situation.\n\nLet us look at the industry landscape that allows such a practice to breed. In 2018, the self-sufficiency level for meat stood at 22%, where the consumption per capita was 6.3kg per year, import value was RM3.8 billion and export value was RM1.2 billion, giving a trade deficit of RM2.6 billion. Similarly, related commodities such as milk and feedstock experienced a deficit of RM2.6 billion and RM10.2 billion respectively in 2018.\n\nThe data implies that, first, the demand for meat and milk is far greater than local supply, which has shown slow growth in the last five decades. Second, Malaysia depends on imported feedstock for her cows.\n\nThe agencies involved in monitoring the sector include the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP), Department of Veterinary Services (DVS), Jabatan Kemajuan Islam Malaysia (Jakim), Malaysian Quarantine and Inspection Services (Maqis), Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), the Royal Malaysian Customs Department (RMCD) and Port Police (PP).\n\nIn simple terms, the cartel uses fake halal certificates for meat from uncertified sources from the point of slaughter, either at the exporting country or at local warehouses, until it reaches consumers. The activities involved are acquisition, storing, processing, smuggling, manipulation, abetting and bringing into the country the non-certified frozen meat through approved import permits.\n\nThe real modus operandi involves a web of collaborative work of the cartel, suppliers, officials and traders both overseas and on the domestic scene. It is alleged that the first point of faking halal certificates may occur at slaughterhouses overseas, which have to get halal certification under the purview of Jakim and DVS. Once the cartel bypasses the first stage of inspection, the rest of the procedures are less of a hurdle.\n\nOnce the meat reaches the ports, the cartel again could move in smoothly with the help of \u201crepresentatives\u201d of very senior officials from government agencies working with it. Upon reaching the warehouses, the meat would be mixed with halal-certified meat and repacked with fake halal logos, then released to the market.\n\nThe supporting structure under which this malpractice takes place is described as follows.\n\nFirst, Malaysia is continuously dependent on meat imports (particularly beef and lamb), owing largely to growing demand, while local production shows the reverse trend. Local production is weak because of low productivity, high cost of production and inefficient small farms. These result in inflows of meat from efficient producers such as Australia, New Zealand and Argentina at relatively lower prices than local sources.\n\nSecond, arbitrage activities thrive when there is a big price gap between two locations. For instance, there are 124 illegal jetties in Kelantan where the black market or smuggling of goods and food commodities has been active for many decades. This occurs because the prices in Thailand are cheaper than in Malaysia. A similar analogy applies in the case of meat imports.\n\nThird, standards, sanitary and phytosanitary requirements and halal certification involve costs and disruption. As such, barriers \u2014 especially those that are messy and costly \u2014 incentivise traders to avoid or bypass the rules wherever possible. Some go to the extreme by violating the law and regulations, especially if the monitoring procedures are weak and ineffective.\n\nFourth, the import industry is oligopolistic in nature, where collusion among members is rampant, as proven in this case.\n\nFifth, it is highly probable that lowly paid government servants are drawn to receive bribes, especially when governance is weak, as proven by the alleged abuse that is said to have occurred for 40 years.\n\nSixth, with six agencies involved in monitoring meat imports, it is highly probable that there exists a redundancy of functions that deter efficiency. Seventh, non-governmental organisations and consumers that have the power to bring about change failed to sound the warning bell.\n\nThe convergence of these factors has led to the scandal being untouched by the law.\n\nWhat are the policy implications? Since this practice has taken root over a long time, no quick solution will undo it. While legal proceedings are a must, medium- and long-term structural changes must be instituted immediately.\n\nFirst, there is an urgent need for a deep inquiry into this matter in terms of the gap between standard operating procedures and reality, the major players that are responsible, the weakest links in the supply chain, the governance structure and the role of public agencies.\n\nSecond, there is an urgent need to increase local production through improvement in productivity and cost reduction. The livestock producers must be empowered with skills, knowledge and advanced technologies to improve production. Production cost can be reduced by using local materials such as palm kernel cake and other sources.\n\nThird, the farmers\u2019 cooperatives have to be strengthened to improve domestic production. Small farms find it hard to sustain production, owing to limited capital for investment but, through this vehicle, they may share resources and gain economies of scale.\n\nFourth, the National Feedlot Centre is not feasible, as it is highly centralised and has proved to be vulnerable to rent-seeking practices in the past. It can be replaced by support measures and incentives to encourage private abattoirs that are more competitive, run either by individuals or cooperatives.\n\nFifth, the cartel can be diffused by competition. The import sector should be opened up to more participants so that market control or any predatory move is checked by the competing participants.\n\nSixth, the data speaks the truth. Digitalisation of the supply chain may provide transactional transparency to all participants, hence minimising malpractices. Among the applications are blockchain, an information and communications technology solution whose distributed ledger technology allows data to be stored on servers. It creates secure, real-time communication networks with partners along the supply chain. The system makes it difficult for one user to gain control of, or game, the network.\n\nMaybe Malaysia is not ready for this, but the concept is of high utility. For a start, the country should focus on developing a complete database of who is doing what as well as their business profile. Data to be monitored is all the players\u2019 profiles, including overseas slaughter houses, in terms of production, quantity and quality traded, price, origin or source of meat, and prices. From the data one can detect irregularities such as a sudden increase in quantity or changes in prices or sources of origin. Such tracking may minimise malpractices along the supply chain. Once these databases are running well, then more sophisticated transaction apps such as blockchain may be considered.\n\nIn short, the issue of fake halal certificates is just a symptom of a deeper structural disease. This refers to a non-transparent procurement system, weak governance, oligopolistic import market and too many agencies involved, resulting in fragmented monitoring and attractive arbitrage opportunities, owing to low domestic production. It mirrors a systemic failure that requires a system overhaul.\n\nProf Datin Paduka Fatimah Mohamed Arshad is head of the agriculture and food security cluster at the Academy of Professors Malaysia.

optical shops, boutiques, sports and recreational activities (except for jogging limited to two persons from the same household and cycling), mass gatherings, tourism activities, tuition classes,

Baru and See had betrayed the party by leaving PKR early last year and the departure of Baru had contributed to the downfall of the Pakatan Harapan (PH) federal government at the time.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference at the PKR Kuching and Stampin Branch office at Jalan Sin Sin Park here today, Ng admitted the state PKR had been weakened following the departure of the duo.\n\n\u201cHowever, it

The party must learn from the setback,\u201d said the former Padungan assemblyman who served from 2006 to 2011.\n\nBaru and See contested and won in the 2016 state polls under the ticket of PKR, but they joined PSB late May last year, after being sacked by PKR following the collapse of the PH government.

for a policy to address birds\u2019 nests on electricity pylons or telecommunication towers.\n\nIn a statement today, MNS Terengganu said it was informed of an active white-bellied sea eagle nest on a telecommunication tower in Merang, Terengganu, which had newly-laid eggs but was \u201cdestroyed\u201d by the tower operators.\n\nThe eagles are classified as a totally protected species under the Wildlife Conservation Act 2010.\n\n\u201cThis is against the Wildlife Conservation Act 2010.\n\n\u201cRather than wait a few months for the family of eagles to raise their young, their future was abruptly terminated,\u201d MNS Terengganu chairman Wong Chee Ho said.\n\nNoting that the country currently lacks any policies on how to deal with nests on towers, Wong proposed a meeting with power company operators in Terengganu, as well as the telecommunication companies that use such towers, to formulate a statewide solution which would be the first for the country.\n\n\u201cWe want to create a new policy to better manage this problem in a way that protects wildlife and ensures the safety of all, including meeting the needs of the corporations and the services they provide.\n\n\u201cThe costs of monitoring all towers and keeping them nest-free is much more than the cost of supporting new and innovative ways of learning to live with the birds,\u201d he said.\n\nWong noted that while many eagles have traditionally constructed their nests on tall trees, more of them are using man-made structures instead.\n\nApart from being taller than many of the surrounding trees and giving birds of prey a better vantage point to survey their territory, such structures are also sturdy and able to support large nests.\n\nWith the expansion of electricity distribution over the past century, and the more recent surge in telecommunication towers, more birds are choosing man-made structures to build their nests.\n\nHowever, nesting birds are known to have disrupted electricity and telecommunication services provided through the towers, while nests made of dry wood and grass can cause fires which lead to service loss for the public and expensive repairs for the companies involved.\n\nPointing out that birds like the white-bellied sea eagle are territorial, Wong said once they have selected a site to nest, they will return to it year after year and rebuild even if their nests are removed.\n\nWhile he admitted some nests will have to be removed as they pose a threat to the company and the birds themselves, Wong stressed the need for a policy on nest removal that does not destroy wildlife.\n\n\u201cPower and telecommunication companies need to explore other ways to resolve this conflict,\u201d he said, suggesting a few solutions that could be incorporated.\n\n\u201cOne solution could be adding a platform to the towers, placed in a safe location, and made suitable for birds of prey to use as nesting platforms.\n\n\u201cCameras could be installed to record video of the nesting birds. This video could be shared as a live feed to generate interest among the public and showcase conservation activities of the corporations involved.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["nesting", "terengganu", "towers", "structures", "wildlife", "policy", "birds", "regrets", "eagles", "telecommunication", "nature", "nests", "removal", "rare", "telco", "nest", "group", "tower"], "summary": "PETALING JAYA: The Malaysian Nature Society (MNS) has called for a policy to address birds\u2019 nests on electricity pylons or telecommunication towers.\nIn a statement today, MNS Terengganu said it was informed of an active white-bellied sea eagle nest on a telecommunication tower in Merang, Terengganu, which had newly-laid eggs but was \u201cdestroyed\u201d by the tower operators.\nThe eagles are classified as a totally protected species under the Wildlife Conservation Act 2010.\nWong noted that while many eagles have traditionally constructed their nests on tall trees, more of them are using man-made structures instead.\n\u201cCameras could be installed to record video of the nesting birds.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-01-11 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Breathing new life into dying art form", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN1bmRhaWx5Lm15L2xvY2FsL2JyZWF0aGluZy1uZXctbGlmZS1pbnRvLWR5aW5nLWFydC1mb3JtLUFGNjA0Mzk5MtIBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://www.thesundaily.my/binrepository/480x320/0c6/480d250/none/11808/NOOF/image-1981530_1983190_20210111114043.jpg", "text": "BACK when the web was what spiders spun and the TV was in black and white, the Chinese opera was the entertainment that drew large crowds.\n\nToday, such performances are staged only occasionally, mostly on significant dates such as the Hungry Ghost Festival.\n\nFor the younger generation, who have unlimited entertainment options thanks to new technology, sitting in the moonlight for a\n\nthree-hour stage retelling of palace intrigue or lost love is no longer as magical.\n\nBut, if Chinese opera enthusiast Daryl Leong, 43, has his way, the lost art may yet get a revival, thanks to technology.\n\nIn Malaysia, the Chinese opera, in various dialects such as Cantonese, Teochew and Hokkien, had its hey day in the 1920s and 1930s,\n\nwhen several troupes travelled across the country to perform for eager fans.\n\nHowever, the number of local troupes eventually dwindled, replaced mostly by those from Thailand, particularly for performances in the Teochew dialect.\n\nAccording to Leong, who is chief secretary of the Yuet Wan Cantonese Opera Association Kuala Lumpur, urbanisation and globalisation also led to a decline, and eventual demise, of the opera.\n\n\u201cMany associations folded up when their opera troupes could not keep up with the times. The Yuet Wan is likely the only group still active in Malaysia,\u201d he told theSun.\n\nLeong lays the blame partly on the failure to instil a love for the art among the younger people.\n\nAs a young man practising an age-old art, he is a rarity. He still dons the full regalia for the occasional performance.\n\nLeong laments the fact that many sifus, or masters of the art form, have not been able to find sufficient interest among the younger generation to whom they can pass on their skills.\n\nOpera, Leong pointed out, is an art form that takes years to learn and even longer to perfect. Another setback is the high cost of the costumes.\n\n\u201cOur costumes cost thousands of ringgit, but we do not earn enough to cover even a fraction of that,\u201d he added.\n\nA three-night performance today would bring barely RM400 to the table. But the destroyer of the opera may yet be its saviour.\n\nLeong is looking to new technology to advance a bold plan \u2013 to give Cantonese opera a revival. He has assembled a troupe of 10 young social media wizards to advance his plan.\n\n\u201cThe young participants have paved more paths for better exposure of Cantonese opera through Facebook and Instagram,\u201d he said.\n\nMany challenges remain.\n\n\u201cFor instance, there are not enough musically-talented people who are interested in opera,\u201d he said.\n\nLeong, who has been pursuing his love for the art with the association since 2016, said the immediate priority is to find a new set of talents who can play traditional Chinese musical instruments.\n\n\u201cWe strive for authenticity so we don\u2019t use pre-recorded music for our shows.

MOH Explains What Happens\n\n1. Get in touch with your district health office\n\nIf you suspect you have contracted the illness, get yourself tested. If you have already tested positive, the Health Ministry\u2019s tweet says that the district health office will contact patients to undergo Covid-19 swab tests.\n\nOnce confirmed positive, they will provide a Monitoring and Observation Order and a quarantine band for positive patients staying at home.\n\n2. The positive patient will need to stay at home for 10 days\n\nQuarantine at home will mean that you won\u2019t be allowed to leave your house for any reason for the period of 10 days.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) also advises that you avoid having visitors over and that they should not interact with the patient under any circumstances.\n\n3. The positive patient should not share a room with any other household members\n\nEven though still at home, you\u2019ll have to separate yourself from the rest of your household to avoid accidentally infecting them. (Credit: Unsplash)\n\nUnless this is possible, home quarantine shouldn\u2019t be your first choice.\n\nA separate room with adequate ventilation should be allocated for the patient. Other household members should stay and sleep in another room and be separated from the patient at all times.\n\nIf possible, other household members should also avoid sharing the same bathroom with the infected person. If you have no choice, WHO advises that taps, doorknobs, and other items are cleaned regularly with soap and water.\n\n4. Household members will have to always wear a face mask and maintain 1 \u2013 2 meters of physical distance from the patient\n\nYes, if you are positive and choose to quarantine at home, your other household members will have to constantly wear a face mask while at home. You must also constantly maintain a physical distance from them to avoid getting them infected as well.\n\n5. Meals, drinks and other essential items should be placed outside the patient\u2019s room door to be taken by themselves\n\nYou and your household members will need to constantly wear a mask while at home during your quarantine period and maintain physical distance from you at all times. (Credit: Unsplash)\n\nPractice contactless delivery when passing food and other essential items to the patient to minimise physical contact between the positive individuals and other members of the household.\n\n6. Other household members will need to wear gloves when handling items used by the positive patient.\n\nWhen handling items used by the infected individual, such as plates, cups, and eating utensils, household members will need to wear disposable gloves.\n\nAfter use, the gloves should be properly discarded without reuse, preferably in a closed container.\n\nWHO advises that separate dishes, cups, eating utensils, bedding, towels, and other essential items be assigned for the infected person.\n\nBeddings, towels, and clothes used by the infected person should be washed with soap and water separately from those used by the rest of the household.\n\n7. The positive patient and other household members should wash their hands with soap and water or use hand sanitiser as frequently as possible.\n\nFrequently washing your hands will reduce the chances of your household members contracting the infection from you.\n\nWash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds at a time and use alcohol-based hand sanitiser when you don\u2019t have the immediate option of using water and soap.\n\nHousehold members should also avoid touching their eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.\n\n8. The positive asymptomatic patient should monitor themselves for Covid-19 symptoms and update these on the MySejahtera app.\n\nMonitor your body temperature every day using a thermometer, and if you develop any flu-like symptoms, such as a fever, cough, difficulty breathing, sore throat, or body aches and pain, update these on the MySejahtera app.\n\nCheck out the Health Ministry\u2019s tweet on the matter below:\n\nJika anda tinggal serumah dengan kes positif #COVID19 yang memilih untuk menjalani kuarantin di rumah, ini langkah-langkah pencegahan yang WAJIB anda lakukan. pic.twitter.com/lufnK03pYN \u2014 KKMalaysia\ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\uddfe (@KKMPutrajaya) January 8, 2021\n\nShare your thoughts with us via TRP\u2019s Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.", "keyword": ["wear", "patients", "quarantine", "heres", "guideline", "positive", "items", "asymptomatic", "mohs", "patient", "covid19", "health", "members", "household"], "summary": "If you\u2019re one of the few lucky ones to have enough space to safely quarantine at home, the Health Ministry recently tweeted a safety guideline for Covid-19 positive patients to undergo their quarantine period in the comfort of their own homes rather than at quarantine centres.\nOnce confirmed positive, they will provide a Monitoring and Observation Order and a quarantine band for positive patients staying at home.\nIf possible, other household members should also avoid sharing the same bathroom with the infected person.\nThe positive patient and other household members should wash their hands with soap and water or use hand sanitiser as frequently as possible.\nFrequently washing your hands will reduce the chances of your household members contracting the infection from you.", "news": "The Rakyat Post", "date": "2021-01-10 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "The yau char kwai man with a gun", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wMS8xMy90aGUteWF3LWNoYXIta3dhaS1tYW4td2l0aC1hLWd1bi_SAQA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/yau-char-kwai-n-sig-sauer-pistol-collage-130121-2.jpg", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: By day, he was selling the fried pastry cakoi or yau char kwai, which translates into oil-fried devil.

Sure, maybe instant noodles or spaghetti might be simple enough to whip up, but Malaysians need good \u2018ol Malaysian food to keep ourselves happy.\n\nBut Malaysian food, such as sambal belacan, is notoriously labourous and difficult, and you have no real cooking experience\u2026 is it possible?\n\nActually, the answer is yes. If someone else has already done all the hard parts of cooking for you.\n\nWe spoke to celebrity chef Sherson Lian, who gave us some tips and tricks on how to make an extremely simple Malaysia\u2019s favourite ikan sambal belacan with almost none of the labour that comes with it.\n\n3-Ingredient Ikan Sambal Belacan\n\nIngredients:\n\nIkan kembung (leatherjacket fish, readily available already cleaned, gutted, and descaled at grocery stores or at the fishmonger\u2019s)\n\nTumeric\n\nSalt\n\nPre-made sambal belacan paste\n\nBanana leaves (optional)\n\nFish, sambal belacan paste, and tumeric. That\u2019s all you need.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\nPreperation:\n\n1) Pat dry the fish. Cut two pockets on both sides along the fish\u2019s spine. (Chef\u2019s note: If you are having trouble with slicing through the flesh, try sharpening your knife. A dull knife can easily cause injuries to yourself.)\n\n2) Give the fish a generous tumeric rub to get rid of its fishy smell, including the insides of the pockets. Then, season it with a little salt.\n\nDo it like salt bae.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\n3) Scoop your sambal belacan paste into the pockets. Be generous with it, but most importantly, use a new clean and dry spoon in between the scoops as you do not want to contaminate the sambal paste.\n\nPockets are meant to be stuffed.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\n4) Heat up a pan to medium-high heat. If you have banana leaves, place it in the pan.\n\n5) Drizzle some oil over the fish. Then, place the fish in the pan.\n\nUse tongs to make it easier to handle the fish.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\n6) Flip the fish and ensure both sides are cooked. (Chef\u2019s note: Ikan kembung has thick skin, so the usual way to check if it\u2019s cooked by poking a fork into the meat won\u2019t work. Instead, check the eyes- they should turn completely white. However, you can leave it to cook a little longer if you\u2019re not sure as this fish is very forgiving to being overcooked.)\n\n7) Serve with rice and enjoy.\n\nA hot, piping meal is ready, all from the comfort of your own home.\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\nSherson notes that sambal belacan is one of those sides that goes well with everything and every family has their own secret recipe. Still, it\u2019s a great beginner paste, and you can easily modify the recipe or use different kinds of protein to pair with the sambal belacan.\n\nIf you put the ikan sambal belacan on a fresh piece of bana leaf with some ceylon as garnish, you could even impress a date!\n\n(Credit: TRP)\n\nThe one used here is from Sherson\u2019s line of Rencah pastes and condiments and is also used in his restaurants. The chili seeds are blended directly into the paste for a smoother taste and he adds thinly sliced calamansi skin for an extra hint of texture and fragrance.\n\nBut this recipe will work with any pre-prepared sambal belacan paste, you won\u2019t need to spend 4 hours making it from scratch.\n\nPS: Fish not quite your thing?
