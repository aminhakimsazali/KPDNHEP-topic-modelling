He said the severe impact on micro and informal enterprises is alarming as they are the most common type of businesses in Malaysia.\n\n\u201cHence, it is almost unimaginable how much these business owners have had to endure during difficult times like this.\n\n\u201cTherefore, to help them navigate through these challenges, IEN has taken the initiative to celebrate Malaysia Day with this MIKM programme where over 150 entrepreneurs are sharing their messages of aspirations and inspirations for our beloved country to bring our nation to greater heights,\u201d he said.\n\nThe launch was a collaboration between IEN and Yayasan Wholistic Family Association (WFA), Asean Chambers of Commerce Industries, d\u2019Tandoor Group of Cos, Messrs Esther Ong Tengku Saiful & Sree and Nerv Global.\n\nNanta Linggi was confident that the event could be beneficial to business owners by connecting them with fellow entrepreneurs and helping them to create business, opportunities and collaborations.\n\n\u201cOne of KPDNHEP\u2019s functions is to develop business opportunities and the socio-economic standing of Malaysians through the profiles of wholesalers and retailers, franchise, direct-selling, hawkers and petty traders as well as downstream sectors of petroleum.\n\n\u201cFor that reason, I encourage Malaysian entrepreneurs to look beyond and expand as well as scale up their businesses by stepping out to start franchising locally and maybe even globally,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the country has its own cuisines which carry huge potential for extension in the franchise industry.\n\n\u201cWhatever your products or services are, this is the time to benefit from the platforms and assistance provided, such as from IEN, to learn and equip yourself with knowledge and rise above all challenges and go beyond our shores, and conquer the world to make our Keluarga Malaysia proud.\n\n\u201cNot only that, I am certain that the initiatives taken by IEN and WFA will create a significant springboard for business collaborations and accelerate the recovery process for many businesses,\u201d he said.", "keyword": ["assistance", "micro",

the price at all stages of the distribution chain.\n\n\u201cThe KPDNHEP always monitors the prices of goods through more than 1,000 Price Monitoring Officers who collect information on the prices of

The future of our country, in terms of Covid-19, depends on us. We cannot depend on the vaccine alone. Self-control is very important or all our efforts will be in vain,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Ismail Sabri said the reopening of the 11 sectors was done according to the data related to Covid-19 clusters of those sectors.\n\n\u201cFor instance, many people said that [reopening of] barbershops is dangerous because it involves close contact, but throughout 2020, only one cluster was detected to have involved a barbershop.\n\n\u201cThe same goes with car wash shops. Many people said the shops have foreign workers, so it will be easier to get infected but in 2020, there [are no clusters] involving car wash shops.\n\n\u201cThese data is the reason we focus on reopening only certain sectors,\u201d he said.\n\nIn reply to a supplementary question from Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail (PH-Kulim Bandar Baharu) on the appointment of former prime minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin as chairman of the National Recovery Council (MPN), Ismail Sabri said it was only right as Muhyiddin has been the chair of MPN since its establishment.\n\n\u201cHe (Muhyiddin)

He said the severe impact on micro and informal enterprises is alarming as they are the most common type of businesses in Malaysia.\n\n\u201cHence, it is almost unimaginable how much these business owners have had to endure during difficult times like this.\n\n\u201cTherefore, to help them navigate through these challenges, IEN has taken the initiative to celebrate Malaysia Day with this MIKM programme where over 150 entrepreneurs are sharing their messages of aspirations and inspirations for our beloved country to bring our nation to greater heights,\u201d he said.\n\nThe launch was a collaboration between IEN and Yayasan Wholistic Family Association (WFA), Asean Chambers of Commerce Industries, d\u2019Tandoor Group of Cos, Messrs Esther Ong Tengku Saiful & Sree and Nerv Global.\n\nNanta Linggi was confident that the event could be beneficial to business owners by connecting them with fellow entrepreneurs and helping them to create business, opportunities and collaborations.\n\n\u201cOne of KPDNHEP\u2019s functions is to develop business opportunities and the socio-economic standing of Malaysians through the profiles of wholesalers and retailers, franchise, direct-selling, hawkers and petty traders as well as downstream sectors of petroleum.\n\n\u201cFor that reason, I encourage Malaysian entrepreneurs to look beyond and expand as well as scale up their businesses by stepping out to start franchising locally and maybe even globally,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the country has its own cuisines which carry huge potential for extension in the franchise industry.\n\n\u201cWhatever your products or services are, this is the time to benefit from the platforms and assistance provided, such as from IEN, to learn and equip yourself with knowledge and rise above all challenges and go beyond our shores, and conquer the world to make our Keluarga Malaysia proud.\n\n\u201cNot only that, I am certain that the initiatives taken by IEN and WFA will create a significant springboard for business collaborations and accelerate the recovery process for many businesses,\u201d he said.", "keyword": ["assistance", "micro",

was reported.\n\nDomestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi said the approach will enable traders to check the price and cost to get a more reasonable profit margin.\n\n\u201cThe approach is also aimed at reminding chicken traders not to raise the price at any stage of the distribution chain at their whims and fancy,\u201d he said in a statement today.\n\nNanta said stern action such as maximum compound or prosecution in court will be taken if the traders refused to cooperate in ensuring the success of the new approach.\n\nHe said the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) was not planning to introduce additional price control measures apart from the usual Festive Season Maximum Price Control Scheme (SHMMP).\n\nHowever, Nanta said his ministry will not hesitate to implement the additional price control measure should the price continue to rise unreasonably or if there were a cartel manipulating the price at all stages of the distribution chain.\n\n\u201cThe KPDNHEP always monitors the prices of goods through more than 1,000 Price Monitoring Officers who collect information on the prices of goods every day and take immediate actions against premises selling goods at unreasonable prices without having to wait for consumers to lodge complaints,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister said based on the monitoring of the retail price on Sept 10, the national average price of cleaned standard chicken is RM8.83/kilogramme (kg).\n\nIn the peninsula, he said the average retail price of cleaned standard chicken is RM8.78/kg and the selling price range is between RM5.99/kg and RM11.00/kg.\n\nHe said premises selling chickens above RM9/kg were mostly wet markets and the highest selling price of RM11.00/kg was detected at Raub General Market in Pahang.\n\nNanta said supermarkets and hypermarkets were still offering cleaned standard chicken at a reasonable price.\n\n\u201cThe lowest price of RM5.99/kg is offered at Tesco/Lotus Hypermarkets nationwide, while Giant, Mydin and Econsave hypermarkets are offering the chicken at between RM7.39 and RM7.99/kg.\n\n\u201cConsumers are advised wisely choose the right place and time to buy chickens at reasonable prices,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Sabah, the average price of cleaned standard chicken is RM11.33/kg with the highest price of RM11.80/kg detected at Gentingmas Mall in Sandakan, while the lowest price was offered at RM10.90/kg at Sibuga Wet Market in Batu 8, Sandakan.\n\nIn Sarawak, the average price of cleaned standard chicken is RM8.56/kg, the highest price of RM9.80/kg detected at Central Market, Sarikei, while the lowest price of RM7.50/kg was offered at Everwin Supermarket in Mukah.\n\nNanta said the ministry would also convene regular meetings with the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industries (MAFI) to ensure factors such as the prices of imported chicken feed, chicken breeds and chicks which will influence the price of chickens could be minimized and managed.\n\nThe chicken industry and supply is regulated by MAFI while KPDNHEP is responsible for matters related to the price of chickens in the

The future of our country, in terms of Covid-19, depends on us. We cannot depend on the vaccine alone. Self-control is very important or all our efforts will be in vain,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Ismail Sabri said the reopening of the 11 sectors was done according to the data related to Covid-19 clusters of those sectors.\n\n\u201cFor instance, many people said that [reopening of] barbershops is dangerous because it involves close contact, but throughout 2020, only one cluster was detected to have involved a barbershop.\n\n\u201cThe same goes with car wash shops. Many people said the shops have foreign workers, so it will be easier to get infected but in 2020, there [are no clusters] involving car wash shops.\n\n\u201cThese data is the reason we focus on reopening only certain sectors,\u201d he said.\n\nIn reply to a supplementary question from Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail (PH-Kulim Bandar Baharu) on the appointment of former prime minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin as chairman of the National Recovery Council (MPN), Ismail Sabri said it was only right as Muhyiddin has been the chair of MPN since its establishment.\n\n\u201cHe (Muhyiddin)

He said the severe impact on micro and informal enterprises is alarming as they are the most common type of businesses in Malaysia.\n\n\u201cHence, it is almost unimaginable how much these business owners have had to endure during difficult times like this.\n\n\u201cTherefore, to help them navigate through these challenges, IEN has taken the initiative to celebrate Malaysia Day with this MIKM programme where over 150 entrepreneurs are sharing their messages of aspirations and inspirations for our beloved country to bring our nation to greater heights,\u201d he said.\n\nThe launch was a collaboration between IEN and Yayasan Wholistic Family Association (WFA), Asean Chambers of Commerce Industries, d\u2019Tandoor Group of Cos, Messrs Esther Ong Tengku Saiful & Sree and Nerv Global.\n\nNanta Linggi was confident that the event could be beneficial to business owners by connecting them with fellow entrepreneurs and helping them to create business, opportunities and collaborations.\n\n\u201cOne of KPDNHEP\u2019s functions is to develop business opportunities and the socio-economic standing of Malaysians through the profiles of wholesalers and retailers, franchise, direct-selling, hawkers and petty traders as well as downstream sectors of petroleum.\n\n\u201cFor that reason, I encourage Malaysian entrepreneurs to look beyond and expand as well as scale up their businesses by stepping out to start franchising locally and maybe even globally,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the country has its own cuisines which carry huge potential for extension in the franchise industry.\n\n\u201cWhatever your products or services are, this is the time to benefit from the platforms and assistance provided, such as from IEN, to learn and equip yourself with knowledge and rise above all challenges and go beyond our shores, and conquer the world to make our Keluarga Malaysia proud.\n\n\u201cNot only that, I am certain that the initiatives

The future of our country, in terms of Covid-19, depends on us. We cannot depend on the vaccine alone. Self-control is very important or all our efforts will be in vain,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Ismail Sabri said the reopening of the 11 sectors was done according to the data related to Covid-19 clusters of those sectors.\n\n\u201cFor instance, many people said that [reopening of] barbershops is dangerous because it involves close contact, but throughout 2020, only one cluster was detected to have involved a barbershop.\n\n\u201cThe same goes with car wash shops. Many people said the shops have foreign workers, so it will be easier to get infected but in 2020, there [are no clusters] involving car wash shops.\n\n\u201cThese data is the reason we focus on reopening only certain sectors,\u201d he said.\n\nIn reply to a supplementary question from Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail (PH-Kulim Bandar Baharu) on the appointment of former prime minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin as chairman of the National Recovery Council (MPN), Ismail Sabri said it was only right as Muhyiddin has been the chair of MPN since its establishment.\n\n\u201cHe (Muhyiddin)

He said the severe impact on micro and informal enterprises is alarming as they are the most common type of businesses in Malaysia.\n\n\u201cHence, it is almost unimaginable how much these business owners have had to endure during difficult times like this.\n\n\u201cTherefore, to help them navigate through these challenges, IEN has taken the initiative to celebrate Malaysia Day with this MIKM

The future of our country, in terms of Covid-19, depends on us. We cannot depend on the vaccine alone. Self-control is very important or all our efforts will be in vain,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Ismail Sabri said the reopening of the 11 sectors was done according to the data related to Covid-19 clusters of those sectors.\n\n\u201cFor instance, many people said that [reopening of] barbershops is dangerous because it involves close contact, but throughout 2020, only one cluster was detected to have involved a barbershop.\n\n\u201cThe same goes with car wash shops. Many people said the shops have foreign workers, so it will be easier to get infected but in 2020, there [are no clusters] involving car wash shops.\n\n\u201cThese data is the reason we focus on reopening only certain sectors,\u201d he said.\n\nIn reply to a supplementary question from Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail (PH-Kulim Bandar Baharu) on the appointment of former prime minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin as chairman of the National Recovery Council (MPN), Ismail Sabri said it was only right as Muhyiddin has been the chair of MPN since its establishment.\n\n\u201cHe (Muhyiddin) has been the chair of the council since the day it was established, so that\u2019s why we entrusted him to continue with it,\u201d he said.\n\nFor more Parliament stories, click here.\n\nRead

He said the severe impact on micro and informal enterprises is alarming as they are the most common type of businesses in Malaysia.\n\n\u201cHence, it is almost unimaginable how much these business owners have had to endure during difficult times like this.\n\n\u201cTherefore, to help them navigate through these challenges, IEN has taken the initiative to celebrate Malaysia Day with this MIKM

The future of our country, in terms of Covid-19, depends on us. We cannot depend on the vaccine alone. Self-control is very important or all our efforts will be in vain,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Ismail Sabri said the reopening of the 11 sectors was done according to the data related to Covid-19 clusters of those sectors.\n\n\u201cFor instance, many people said that [reopening of] barbershops is dangerous because it involves close contact, but throughout 2020, only one cluster was detected to have involved a barbershop.\n\n\u201cThe same goes with car wash shops. Many people said the shops have foreign workers, so it will be easier to get infected but in 2020, there [are no clusters] involving car wash shops.\n\n\u201cThese data is the reason we focus on reopening only certain sectors,\u201d he said.\n\nIn reply to a supplementary question from Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail (PH-Kulim Bandar Baharu) on the appointment of former prime minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin as chairman of the National Recovery Council (MPN), Ismail Sabri said it was only right as Muhyiddin has been the chair of MPN since its establishment.\n\n\u201cHe (Muhyiddin) has been the chair of the council since the day it was established, so that\u2019s why we entrusted him to continue with it,\u201d he said.\n\nFor more Parliament stories, click here.\n\nRead

He said the severe impact on micro and informal enterprises is alarming as they are the most common type of businesses in Malaysia.\n\n\u201cHence, it is almost unimaginable how much these business owners have had to endure during difficult times like this.\n\n\u201cTherefore, to help them navigate through these challenges, IEN has taken the initiative to celebrate Malaysia Day with this MIKM

The future of our country, in terms of Covid-19, depends on us. We cannot depend on the vaccine alone. Self-control is very important or all our efforts will be in vain,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Ismail Sabri said the reopening of the 11 sectors was done according to the data related to Covid-19 clusters of those sectors.\n\n\u201cFor instance, many people said that [reopening of] barbershops is dangerous because it involves close contact, but throughout 2020, only one cluster was detected to have involved a barbershop.\n\n\u201cThe same goes with car wash shops. Many people said the shops have foreign workers, so it will be easier to get infected but in 2020, there [are no clusters] involving car wash shops.\n\n\u201cThese data is the reason we focus on reopening only certain sectors,\u201d he said.\n\nIn reply to a supplementary question from Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail (PH-Kulim Bandar Baharu) on the appointment of former prime minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin as chairman of the National Recovery Council (MPN), Ismail Sabri said it was only right as Muhyiddin has been the chair of MPN since its establishment.\n\n\u201cHe (Muhyiddin) has been the chair of the council since the day it was established, so that\u2019s why we entrusted him to continue with it,\u201d he said.\n\nFor more Parliament stories, click here.\n\nRead

He said the severe impact on micro and informal enterprises is alarming as they are the most common type of businesses in Malaysia.\n\n\u201cHence, it is almost unimaginable how much these business owners have had to endure during difficult times like this.\n\n\u201cTherefore, to help them navigate through these challenges, IEN has taken the initiative to celebrate Malaysia Day with this MIKM

The future of our country, in terms of Covid-19, depends on us. We cannot depend on the vaccine alone. Self-control is very important or all our efforts will be in vain,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Ismail Sabri said the reopening of the 11 sectors was done according to the data related to Covid-19 clusters of those sectors.\n\n\u201cFor instance, many people said that [reopening of] barbershops is dangerous because it involves close contact, but throughout 2020, only one cluster was detected to have involved a barbershop.\n\n\u201cThe same goes with car wash shops. Many people said the shops have foreign workers, so it will be easier to get infected but in 2020, there [are no clusters] involving car wash shops.\n\n\u201cThese data is the reason we focus on reopening only certain sectors,\u201d he said.\n\nIn reply to a supplementary question from Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail (PH-Kulim Bandar Baharu) on the appointment of former prime minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin as chairman of the National Recovery Council (MPN), Ismail Sabri said it was only right as Muhyiddin has been the chair of MPN since its establishment.\n\n\u201cHe (Muhyiddin) has been the chair of the council since the day it was established, so that\u2019s why we entrusted him to continue with it,\u201d he said.\n\nFor more Parliament stories, click here.\n\nRead

He said the severe impact on micro and informal enterprises is alarming as they are the most common type of businesses in Malaysia.\n\n\u201cHence, it is almost unimaginable how much these business owners have had to endure during difficult times like this.\n\n\u201cTherefore, to help them navigate through these challenges, IEN has taken the initiative to celebrate Malaysia Day with this MIKM

The future of our country, in terms of Covid-19, depends on us. We cannot depend on the vaccine alone. Self-control is very important or all our efforts will be in vain,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Ismail Sabri said the reopening of the 11 sectors was done according to the data related to Covid-19 clusters of those sectors.\n\n\u201cFor instance, many people said that [reopening of] barbershops is dangerous because it involves close contact, but throughout 2020, only one cluster was detected to have involved a barbershop.\n\n\u201cThe same goes with car wash shops. Many people said the shops have foreign workers, so it will be easier to get infected but in 2020, there [are no clusters] involving car wash shops.\n\n\u201cThese data is the reason we focus on reopening only certain sectors,\u201d he said.\n\nIn reply to a supplementary question from Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail (PH-Kulim Bandar Baharu) on the appointment of former prime minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin as chairman of the National Recovery Council (MPN), Ismail Sabri said it was only right as Muhyiddin has been the chair of MPN since its establishment.\n\n\u201cHe (Muhyiddin) has been the chair of the council since the day it was established, so that\u2019s why we entrusted him to continue with it,\u201d he said.\n\nFor more Parliament stories, click here.\n\nRead

He said the severe impact on micro and informal enterprises is alarming as they are the most common type of businesses in Malaysia.\n\n\u201cHence, it is almost unimaginable how much these business owners have had to endure during difficult times like this.\n\n\u201cTherefore, to help them navigate through these challenges, IEN has taken the initiative to celebrate Malaysia Day with this MIKM

The future of our country, in terms of Covid-19, depends on us. We cannot depend on the vaccine alone. Self-control is very important or all our efforts will be in vain,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Ismail Sabri said the reopening of the 11 sectors was done according to the data related to Covid-19 clusters of those sectors.\n\n\u201cFor instance, many people said that [reopening of] barbershops is dangerous because it involves close contact, but throughout 2020, only one cluster was detected to have involved a barbershop.\n\n\u201cThe same goes with car wash shops. Many people said the shops have foreign workers, so it will be easier to get infected but in 2020, there [are no clusters] involving car wash shops.\n\n\u201cThese data is the reason we focus on reopening only certain sectors,\u201d he said.\n\nIn reply to a supplementary question from Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail (PH-Kulim Bandar Baharu) on the appointment of former prime minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin as chairman of the National Recovery Council (MPN), Ismail Sabri said it was only right as Muhyiddin has been the chair of MPN since its establishment.\n\n\u201cHe (Muhyiddin) has been the chair of the council since the day it was established, so that\u2019s why we entrusted him to continue with it,\u201d he said.\n\nFor more Parliament stories, click here.\n\nRead

He said the severe impact on micro and informal enterprises is alarming as they are the most common type of businesses in Malaysia.\n\n\u201cHence, it is almost unimaginable how much these business owners have had to endure during difficult times like this.\n\n\u201cTherefore, to help them navigate through these challenges, IEN has taken the initiative to celebrate Malaysia Day with this MIKM

The future of our country, in terms of Covid-19, depends on us. We cannot depend on the vaccine alone. Self-control is very important or all our efforts will be in vain,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Ismail Sabri said the reopening of the 11 sectors was done according to the data related to Covid-19 clusters of those sectors.\n\n\u201cFor instance, many people said that [reopening of] barbershops is dangerous because it involves close contact, but throughout 2020, only one cluster was detected to have involved a barbershop.\n\n\u201cThe same goes with car wash shops. Many people said the shops have foreign workers, so it will be easier to get infected but in 2020, there [are no clusters] involving car wash shops.\n\n\u201cThese data is the reason we focus on reopening only certain sectors,\u201d he said.\n\nIn reply to a supplementary question from Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail (PH-Kulim Bandar Baharu) on the appointment of former prime minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin as chairman of the National Recovery Council (MPN), Ismail Sabri said it was only right as Muhyiddin has been the chair of MPN since its establishment.\n\n\u201cHe (Muhyiddin) has been the chair of the council since the day it was established, so that\u2019s why we entrusted him to continue with it,\u201d he said.\n\nFor more Parliament stories, click here.\n\nRead
