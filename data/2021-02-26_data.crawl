Hospitals of Malaysia (APHM) wants the government to let private healthcare providers procure their own vaccines to help speed up the process of immunisation as it will benefit everyone.\n\nAPHM president Dr Kuljit Singh pointed out that there was no competition to see who can get vaccinated first nor was there any profit motive involved.\n\n\u201cPrivate healthcare just wants to chip in where they can to help Malaysia get back on its feet,\u201d he said, adding that allowing private hospitals to buy their own vaccines would also free up slots in the national waiting list for those who can\u2019t afford to get vaccinated themselves.\n\nHe said this in response to the government agreeing to rope in general practitioners to administer Covid-19 vaccines in phase two and three of the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme.\n\nWelcoming the move, Kuljit, however, urged the government to hasten the process by allowing private healthcare providers to procure their own NPRA-approved vaccines.\n\nHe said that based on the current rate of vaccination, it will take a long time for the government to complete vaccinating all of its frontliners on the list, much less the general population.\n\n\u201cAs it stands, you have to register for your first dose and wait for your booking to be confirmed. All that adds up to make the waiting time much longer than it should be.\n\n\u201cIt is also important to note how the government\u2019s vaccine will be arriving in batches, extending the wait even longer,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to Kuljit, if private hospitals could procure their own vaccines, those who can afford the vaccines will be freeing up slots for those who can\u2019t afford it.\n\n\u201cAlthough some are understandably concerned with the issue of fairness, this is not the time to start any discussion on why the wealthier should get protected earlier than the rest.\u201d\n\nHe highlighted that the priority was to protect as many people against Covid-19 and as fast as possible.\n\n\u201cThere is no point having one group protected while the rest are not.\u201d\n\nOn the pricing for vaccinations, should the government give the necessary approval, Kuljit said there will be no profiteering involved.\n\n\u201cRest assured that we\u2019ll only be charging the market price for the vaccine. We\u2019re not trying to exploit the pandemic,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Press Club (NPC) is hopeful that discussions with the government will see media workers, including journalists and photographers, getting the Covid-19 vaccine as soon as possible.\n\nBernama reported NPC president Ahirudin Attan as saying that media workers are also frontline personnel who should be vaccinated in the initial phase as they go to the ground to cover the news and come face-to-face with the people.\n\nHe added that NPC is aware of the need for other frontliners to be given priority for Covid-19 jabs but wants media workers to receive the appropriate attention under the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR OUR LIVE UPDATE OF THE COVID-19 SITUATION IN MALAYSIA\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["vaccination", "let", "aphm", "vaccines", "competition", "workers", "procure", "private", "wants", "hospitals", "kuljit", "covid19", "vaccinated", "national", "vaccine"], "summary": "PETALING JAYA: The Association of Private Hospitals of Malaysia (APHM) wants the government to let private healthcare providers procure their own vaccines to help speed up the process of immunisation as it will benefit everyone.\nAPHM president Dr Kuljit Singh pointed out that there was no competition to see who can get vaccinated first nor was there any profit motive involved.\nHe said this in response to the government agreeing to rope in general practitioners to administer Covid-19 vaccines in phase two and three of the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme.\nWelcoming the move, Kuljit, however, urged the government to hasten the process by allowing private healthcare providers to procure their own NPRA-approved vaccines.\nAccording to Kuljit, if private hospitals could procure their own vaccines, those who can afford the vaccines will be freeing up slots for those who can\u2019t afford it.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "MKN\u2019s Official CMCO SOP As Of 10 March (In English)", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wMy8xMS9ta25zLW9mZmljaWFsLWNtY28tc29wLWFzLW9mLTEwLW1hcmNoLWluLWVuZ2xpc2gv0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlcmFreWF0cG9zdC5jb20vbmV3cy9tYWxheXNpYS8yMDIxLzAzLzExL21rbnMtb2ZmaWNpYWwtY21jby1zb3AtYXMtb2YtMTAtbWFyY2gtaW4tZW5nbGlzaC9hbXAv?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Hamzah Nazari", "Maya Suraya", "Azizul Rahman Ismail"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/CMCO.jpg", "text": "Subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates.\n\nFor your convenience, we\u2019ve translated to English the latest Conditional Movement Control Order (CMCO) standard operating procedure (SOP) released by the National Security Council (MKN).

Hospitals of Malaysia (APHM) wants the government to let private healthcare providers procure their own vaccines to help speed up the process of immunisation as it will benefit everyone.\n\nAPHM president Dr Kuljit Singh pointed out that there was no competition to see who can get vaccinated first nor was there any profit motive involved.\n\n\u201cPrivate healthcare just wants to chip in where they can to help Malaysia get back on its feet,\u201d he said, adding that allowing private hospitals to buy their own vaccines would also free up slots in the national waiting list for those who can\u2019t afford to get vaccinated themselves.\n\nHe said this in response to the government agreeing to rope in general practitioners to administer Covid-19 vaccines in phase two and three of the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme.\n\nWelcoming the move, Kuljit, however, urged the government to hasten the process by allowing private healthcare providers to procure their own NPRA-approved vaccines.\n\nHe said that based on the current rate of vaccination, it will take a long time for the government to complete vaccinating all of its frontliners on the list, much less the general population.\n\n\u201cAs it stands, you have to register for your first dose and wait for your booking to be confirmed. All that adds up to make the waiting time much longer than it should be.\n\n\u201cIt is also important to note how the government\u2019s vaccine will be arriving in batches, extending the wait even longer,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to Kuljit, if private hospitals could procure their own vaccines, those who can afford the vaccines will be freeing up slots for those who can\u2019t afford it.\n\n\u201cAlthough some are understandably concerned with the issue of fairness, this is not the time to start any discussion on why the wealthier should get protected earlier than the rest.\u201d\n\nHe highlighted that the priority was to protect as many people against Covid-19 and as fast as possible.\n\n\u201cThere is no point having one group protected while the rest are not.\u201d\n\nOn the pricing for vaccinations, should the government give the necessary approval, Kuljit said there will be no profiteering involved.\n\n\u201cRest assured that we\u2019ll only be charging the market price for the vaccine. We\u2019re not trying to exploit the pandemic,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Press Club (NPC) is hopeful that discussions with the government will see media workers, including journalists and photographers, getting the Covid-19 vaccine as soon as possible.\n\nBernama reported NPC president Ahirudin Attan as saying that media workers are also frontline personnel who should be vaccinated in the initial phase as they go to the ground to cover the news and come face-to-face with the people.\n\nHe added that NPC is aware of the need for other frontliners to be given priority for Covid-19 jabs but wants media workers to receive the appropriate attention under the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR OUR LIVE UPDATE OF THE COVID-19 SITUATION IN MALAYSIA\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["vaccination", "let", "aphm", "vaccines", "competition", "workers", "procure", "private", "wants", "hospitals", "kuljit", "covid19", "vaccinated", "national", "vaccine"], "summary": "PETALING JAYA: The Association of Private Hospitals of Malaysia (APHM) wants the government to let private healthcare providers procure their own vaccines to help speed up the process of immunisation as it will benefit everyone.\nAPHM president Dr Kuljit Singh pointed out that there was no competition to see who can get vaccinated first nor was there any profit motive involved.\nHe said this in response to the government agreeing to rope in general practitioners to administer Covid-19 vaccines in phase two and three of the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme.\nWelcoming the move, Kuljit, however, urged the government to hasten the process by allowing private healthcare providers to procure their own NPRA-approved vaccines.\nAccording to Kuljit, if private hospitals could procure their own vaccines, those who can afford the vaccines will be freeing up slots for those who can\u2019t afford it.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "MKN\u2019s Official CMCO SOP As Of 10 March (In English)", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wMy8xMS9ta25zLW9mZmljaWFsLWNtY28tc29wLWFzLW9mLTEwLW1hcmNoLWluLWVuZ2xpc2gv0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlcmFreWF0cG9zdC5jb20vbmV3cy9tYWxheXNpYS8yMDIxLzAzLzExL21rbnMtb2ZmaWNpYWwtY21jby1zb3AtYXMtb2YtMTAtbWFyY2gtaW4tZW5nbGlzaC9hbXAv?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Hamzah Nazari", "Maya Suraya", "Azizul Rahman Ismail"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/CMCO.jpg", "text": "Subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates.\n\nFor your convenience, we\u2019ve translated to English the latest Conditional Movement Control Order (CMCO) standard operating procedure (SOP) released by the National Security Council (MKN).

Hospitals of Malaysia (APHM) wants the government to let private healthcare providers procure their own vaccines to help speed up the process of immunisation as it will benefit everyone.\n\nAPHM president Dr Kuljit Singh pointed out that there was no competition to see who can get vaccinated first nor was there any profit motive involved.\n\n\u201cPrivate healthcare just wants to chip in where they can to help Malaysia get back on its feet,\u201d he said, adding that allowing private hospitals to buy their own vaccines would also free up slots in the national waiting list for those who can\u2019t afford to get vaccinated themselves.\n\nHe said this in response to the government agreeing to rope in general practitioners to administer Covid-19 vaccines in phase two and three of the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme.\n\nWelcoming the move, Kuljit, however, urged the government to hasten the process by allowing private healthcare providers to procure their own NPRA-approved vaccines.\n\nHe said that based on the current rate of vaccination, it will take a long time for the government to complete vaccinating all of its frontliners on the list, much less the general population.\n\n\u201cAs it stands, you have to register for your first dose and wait for your booking to be confirmed. All that adds up to make the waiting time much longer than it should be.\n\n\u201cIt is also important to note how the government\u2019s vaccine will be arriving in batches, extending the wait even longer,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to Kuljit, if private hospitals could procure their own vaccines, those who can afford the vaccines will be freeing up slots for those who can\u2019t afford it.\n\n\u201cAlthough some are understandably concerned with the issue of fairness, this is not the time to start any discussion on why the wealthier should get protected earlier than the rest.\u201d\n\nHe highlighted that the priority was to protect as many people against Covid-19 and as fast as possible.\n\n\u201cThere is no point having one group protected while the rest are not.\u201d\n\nOn the pricing for vaccinations, should the government give the necessary approval, Kuljit said there will be no profiteering involved.\n\n\u201cRest assured that we\u2019ll only be charging the market price for the vaccine. We\u2019re not trying to exploit the pandemic,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Press Club (NPC) is hopeful that discussions with the government will see media workers, including journalists and photographers, getting the Covid-19 vaccine as soon as possible.\n\nBernama reported NPC president Ahirudin Attan as saying that media workers are also frontline personnel who should be vaccinated in the initial phase as they go to the ground to cover the news and come face-to-face with the people.\n\nHe added that NPC is aware of the need for other frontliners to be given priority for Covid-19 jabs but wants media workers to receive the appropriate attention under the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR OUR LIVE UPDATE OF THE COVID-19 SITUATION IN MALAYSIA\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["vaccination", "let", "aphm", "vaccines", "competition", "workers", "procure", "private", "wants", "hospitals", "kuljit", "covid19", "vaccinated", "national", "vaccine"], "summary": "PETALING JAYA: The Association of Private Hospitals of Malaysia (APHM) wants the government to let private healthcare providers procure their own vaccines to help speed up the process of immunisation as it will benefit everyone.\nAPHM president Dr Kuljit Singh pointed out that there was no competition to see who can get vaccinated first nor was there any profit motive involved.\nHe said this in response to the government agreeing to rope in general practitioners to administer Covid-19 vaccines in phase two and three of the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme.\nWelcoming the move, Kuljit, however, urged the government to hasten the process by allowing private healthcare providers to procure their own NPRA-approved vaccines.\nAccording to Kuljit, if private hospitals could procure their own vaccines, those who can afford the vaccines will be freeing up slots for those who can\u2019t afford it.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "MKN\u2019s Official CMCO SOP As Of 10 March (In English)", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wMy8xMS9ta25zLW9mZmljaWFsLWNtY28tc29wLWFzLW9mLTEwLW1hcmNoLWluLWVuZ2xpc2gv0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlcmFreWF0cG9zdC5jb20vbmV3cy9tYWxheXNpYS8yMDIxLzAzLzExL21rbnMtb2ZmaWNpYWwtY21jby1zb3AtYXMtb2YtMTAtbWFyY2gtaW4tZW5nbGlzaC9hbXAv?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Hamzah Nazari", "Maya Suraya", "Azizul Rahman Ismail"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/CMCO.jpg", "text": "Subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates.\n\nFor your convenience, we\u2019ve translated to English the latest Conditional Movement Control Order (CMCO) standard operating procedure (SOP) released by the National Security Council (MKN).

Hospitals of Malaysia (APHM) wants the government to let private healthcare providers procure their own vaccines to help speed up the process of immunisation as it will benefit everyone.\n\nAPHM

where they can to help Malaysia get back on its feet,\u201d he said, adding that allowing private hospitals to buy their own vaccines would also free up slots in the national waiting list for those who can\u2019t afford to get vaccinated themselves.\n\nHe said this in response to the government agreeing to rope in general practitioners to administer Covid-19 vaccines in phase two and three of the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme.\n\nWelcoming the move, Kuljit, however, urged the government to hasten the process by allowing private healthcare providers to procure their own NPRA-approved vaccines.\n\nHe said that based on the current rate of vaccination, it will take a long time for the government to complete vaccinating all of its frontliners on the list, much less the general population.\n\n\u201cAs it stands, you have to register for your first dose and wait for your booking to be confirmed. All that adds up to make the waiting time much longer than it should be.\n\n\u201cIt is also important to note how the government\u2019s vaccine will be arriving in batches, extending the wait even longer,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to Kuljit, if private hospitals could procure their own vaccines, those who can afford the vaccines will be freeing up slots for those who can\u2019t afford it.\n\n\u201cAlthough some are understandably concerned with the issue of fairness, this is not the time to start any discussion on why the wealthier should get protected earlier than the rest.\u201d\n\nHe highlighted that the priority was to protect as many people against Covid-19 and as fast as possible.\n\n\u201cThere is no point having one group protected while the rest are not.\u201d\n\nOn the pricing for vaccinations, should the government give the necessary approval, Kuljit said there will be no profiteering involved.\n\n\u201cRest assured that we\u2019ll only be charging the market price for the vaccine.

Hospitals of Malaysia (APHM) wants the government to let private healthcare providers procure their own vaccines to help speed up the process of immunisation as it will benefit everyone.\n\nAPHM president Dr Kuljit Singh pointed out that there was no competition to see who can get vaccinated first nor was there any profit motive involved.\n\n\u201cPrivate healthcare just wants to chip in where they can to help Malaysia get back on its feet,\u201d he said, adding that allowing private hospitals to buy their own vaccines would also free up slots in the national waiting list for those who can\u2019t afford to get vaccinated themselves.\n\nHe said this in response to the government agreeing to rope in general practitioners to administer Covid-19 vaccines in phase two and three of the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme.\n\nWelcoming the move, Kuljit, however, urged the government to hasten the process by allowing private healthcare providers to procure their own NPRA-approved vaccines.\n\nHe said that based on the current rate of vaccination, it will take a long time for the government to complete vaccinating all of its frontliners on the list, much less the general population.\n\n\u201cAs it stands, you have to register for your first dose and wait for your booking to be confirmed. All that adds up to make the waiting time much longer than it should be.\n\n\u201cIt is also important to note how the government\u2019s vaccine will be arriving in batches, extending the wait even longer,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to Kuljit, if private hospitals could procure their own vaccines, those who can afford the vaccines will be freeing up slots for those who can\u2019t afford it.\n\n\u201cAlthough some are understandably concerned with the issue of fairness, this is not the time to start any discussion on why the wealthier should get protected earlier than the rest.\u201d\n\nHe highlighted that the priority was to protect as many people against Covid-19 and as fast as possible.\n\n\u201cThere is no point having one group protected while the rest are not.\u201d\n\nOn the pricing for vaccinations, should the government give the necessary approval, Kuljit said there will be no profiteering involved.\n\n\u201cRest assured that we\u2019ll only be charging the market price for the vaccine. We\u2019re not trying to exploit the pandemic,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Press Club (NPC) is hopeful that discussions with the government will see media workers, including journalists and photographers, getting the Covid-19 vaccine as soon as possible.\n\nBernama reported NPC president Ahirudin Attan as saying that media workers are also frontline personnel who should be vaccinated in the initial phase as they go to the ground to cover the news and come face-to-face with the people.\n\nHe added that NPC is aware of the need for other frontliners to be given priority for Covid-19 jabs but wants media workers to receive the appropriate attention under the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR OUR LIVE UPDATE OF THE COVID-19 SITUATION IN MALAYSIA\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["vaccination", "let", "aphm", "vaccines", "competition", "workers", "procure", "private", "wants", "hospitals", "kuljit", "covid19", "vaccinated", "national", "vaccine"], "summary": "PETALING JAYA: The Association of Private Hospitals of Malaysia (APHM) wants the government to let private healthcare providers procure their own vaccines to help speed up the process of immunisation as it will benefit everyone.\nAPHM president Dr Kuljit Singh pointed out that there was no competition to see who can get vaccinated first nor was there any profit motive involved.\nHe said this in response to the government agreeing to rope in general practitioners to administer Covid-19 vaccines in phase two and three of the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme.\nWelcoming the move, Kuljit, however, urged the government to hasten the process by allowing private healthcare providers to procure their own NPRA-approved vaccines.\nAccording to Kuljit, if private hospitals could procure their own vaccines, those who can afford the vaccines will be freeing up slots for those who can\u2019t afford it.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "MKN\u2019s Official CMCO SOP As Of 10 March (In English)", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wMy8xMS9ta25zLW9mZmljaWFsLWNtY28tc29wLWFzLW9mLTEwLW1hcmNoLWluLWVuZ2xpc2gv0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlcmFreWF0cG9zdC5jb20vbmV3cy9tYWxheXNpYS8yMDIxLzAzLzExL21rbnMtb2ZmaWNpYWwtY21jby1zb3AtYXMtb2YtMTAtbWFyY2gtaW4tZW5nbGlzaC9hbXAv?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Hamzah Nazari", "Maya Suraya", "Azizul Rahman Ismail"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/CMCO.jpg", "text": "Subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates.\n\nFor your convenience, we\u2019ve translated to English the latest Conditional Movement Control Order (CMCO) standard operating procedure (SOP) released by the National Security Council (MKN).

Hospitals of Malaysia (APHM) wants the government to let private healthcare providers procure their own vaccines to help speed up the process of immunisation as it will benefit everyone.\n\nAPHM

where they can to help Malaysia get back on its feet,\u201d he said, adding that allowing private hospitals to buy their own vaccines would also free up slots in the national waiting list for those who can\u2019t afford to get vaccinated themselves.\n\nHe said this in response to the government agreeing to rope in general practitioners to administer Covid-19 vaccines in phase two and three of the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme.\n\nWelcoming the move, Kuljit, however, urged the government to hasten the process by allowing private healthcare providers to procure their own NPRA-approved vaccines.\n\nHe said that based on the current rate of vaccination, it will take a long time for the government to complete vaccinating all of its frontliners on the list, much less the general population.\n\n\u201cAs it stands, you have to register for your first dose and wait for your booking to be confirmed. All that adds up to make the waiting time much longer than it should be.\n\n\u201cIt is also important to note how the government\u2019s vaccine will be arriving in batches, extending the wait even longer,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to Kuljit, if private hospitals could procure their own vaccines, those who can afford the vaccines will be freeing up slots for those who can\u2019t afford it.\n\n\u201cAlthough some are understandably concerned with the issue of fairness, this is not the time to start any discussion on why the wealthier should get protected earlier than the rest.\u201d\n\nHe highlighted that the priority was to protect as many people against Covid-19 and as fast as possible.\n\n\u201cThere is no point having one group protected while the rest are not.\u201d\n\nOn the pricing for vaccinations, should the government give the necessary approval, Kuljit said there will be no profiteering involved.\n\n\u201cRest assured that we\u2019ll only be charging the market price for the vaccine.

Hospitals of Malaysia (APHM) wants the government to let private healthcare providers procure their own vaccines to help speed up the process of immunisation as it will benefit everyone.\n\nAPHM president Dr Kuljit Singh pointed out that there was no competition to see who can get vaccinated first nor was there any profit motive involved.\n\n\u201cPrivate healthcare just wants to chip in where they can to help Malaysia get back on its feet,\u201d he said, adding that allowing private hospitals to buy their own vaccines would also free up slots in the national waiting list for those who can\u2019t afford to get vaccinated themselves.\n\nHe said this in response to the government agreeing to rope in general practitioners to administer Covid-19 vaccines in phase two and three of the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme.\n\nWelcoming the move, Kuljit, however, urged the government to hasten the process by allowing private healthcare providers to procure their own NPRA-approved vaccines.\n\nHe said that based on the current rate of vaccination, it will take a long time for the government to complete vaccinating all of its frontliners on the list, much less the general population.\n\n\u201cAs it stands, you have to register for your first dose and wait for your booking to be confirmed. All that adds up to make the waiting time much longer than it should be.\n\n\u201cIt is also important to note how the government\u2019s vaccine will be arriving in batches, extending the wait even longer,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to Kuljit, if private hospitals could procure their own vaccines, those who can afford the vaccines will be freeing up slots for those who can\u2019t afford it.\n\n\u201cAlthough some are understandably concerned with the issue of fairness, this is not the time to start any discussion on why the wealthier should get protected earlier than the rest.\u201d\n\nHe highlighted that the priority was to protect as many people against Covid-19 and as fast as possible.\n\n\u201cThere is no point having one group protected while the rest are not.\u201d\n\nOn the pricing for vaccinations, should the government give the necessary approval, Kuljit said there will be no profiteering involved.\n\n\u201cRest assured that we\u2019ll only be charging the market price for the vaccine. We\u2019re not trying to exploit the pandemic,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Press Club (NPC) is hopeful that discussions with the government will see media workers, including journalists and photographers, getting the Covid-19 vaccine as soon as possible.\n\nBernama reported NPC president Ahirudin Attan as saying that media workers are also frontline personnel who should be vaccinated in the initial phase as they go to the ground to cover the news and come face-to-face with the people.\n\nHe added that NPC is aware of the need for other frontliners to be given priority for Covid-19 jabs but wants media workers to receive the appropriate attention under the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR OUR LIVE UPDATE OF THE COVID-19 SITUATION IN MALAYSIA\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["vaccination", "let", "aphm", "vaccines", "competition", "workers", "procure", "private", "wants", "hospitals", "kuljit", "covid19", "vaccinated", "national", "vaccine"], "summary": "PETALING JAYA: The Association of Private Hospitals of Malaysia (APHM) wants the government to let private healthcare providers procure their own vaccines to help speed up the process of immunisation as it will benefit everyone.\nAPHM president Dr Kuljit Singh pointed out that there was no competition to see who can get vaccinated first nor was there any profit motive involved.\nHe said this in response to the government agreeing to rope in general practitioners to administer Covid-19 vaccines in phase two and three of the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme.\nWelcoming the move, Kuljit, however, urged the government to hasten the process by allowing private healthcare providers to procure their own NPRA-approved vaccines.\nAccording to Kuljit, if private hospitals could procure their own vaccines, those who can afford the vaccines will be freeing up slots for those who can\u2019t afford it.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "MKN\u2019s Official CMCO SOP As Of 10 March (In English)", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wMy8xMS9ta25zLW9mZmljaWFsLWNtY28tc29wLWFzLW9mLTEwLW1hcmNoLWluLWVuZ2xpc2gv0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlcmFreWF0cG9zdC5jb20vbmV3cy9tYWxheXNpYS8yMDIxLzAzLzExL21rbnMtb2ZmaWNpYWwtY21jby1zb3AtYXMtb2YtMTAtbWFyY2gtaW4tZW5nbGlzaC9hbXAv?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Hamzah Nazari", "Maya Suraya", "Azizul Rahman Ismail"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/CMCO.jpg", "text": "Subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates.\n\nFor your convenience, we\u2019ve translated to English the latest Conditional Movement Control Order (CMCO) standard operating procedure (SOP) released by the National Security Council (MKN).

Hospitals of Malaysia (APHM) wants the government to let private healthcare providers procure their own vaccines to help speed up the process of immunisation as it will benefit everyone.\n\nAPHM

where they can to help Malaysia get back on its feet,\u201d he said, adding that allowing private hospitals to buy their own vaccines would also free up slots in the national waiting list for those who can\u2019t afford to get vaccinated themselves.\n\nHe said this in response to the government agreeing to rope in general practitioners to administer Covid-19 vaccines in phase two and three of the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme.\n\nWelcoming the move, Kuljit, however, urged the government to hasten the process by allowing private healthcare providers to procure their own NPRA-approved vaccines.\n\nHe said that based on the current rate of vaccination, it will take a long time for the government to complete vaccinating all of its frontliners on the list, much less the general population.\n\n\u201cAs it stands, you have to register for your first dose and wait for your booking to be confirmed. All that adds up to make the waiting time much longer than it should be.\n\n\u201cIt is also important to note how the government\u2019s vaccine will be arriving in batches, extending the wait even longer,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to Kuljit, if private hospitals could procure their own vaccines, those who can afford the vaccines will be freeing up slots for those who can\u2019t afford it.\n\n\u201cAlthough some are understandably concerned with the issue of fairness, this is not the time to start any discussion on why the wealthier should get protected earlier than the rest.\u201d\n\nHe highlighted that the priority was to protect as many people against Covid-19 and as fast as possible.\n\n\u201cThere is no point having one group protected while the rest are not.\u201d\n\nOn the pricing for vaccinations, should the government give the necessary approval, Kuljit said there will be no profiteering involved.\n\n\u201cRest assured that we\u2019ll only be charging the market price for the vaccine.

Hospitals of Malaysia (APHM) wants the government to let private healthcare providers procure their own vaccines to help speed up the process of immunisation as it will benefit everyone.\n\nAPHM president Dr Kuljit Singh pointed out that there was no competition to see who can get vaccinated first nor was there any profit motive involved.\n\n\u201cPrivate healthcare just wants to chip in where they can to help Malaysia get back on its feet,\u201d he said, adding that allowing private hospitals to buy their own vaccines would also free up slots in the national waiting list for those who can\u2019t afford to get vaccinated themselves.\n\nHe said this in response to the government agreeing to rope in general practitioners to administer Covid-19 vaccines in phase two and three of the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme.\n\nWelcoming the move, Kuljit, however, urged the government to hasten the process by allowing private healthcare providers to procure their own NPRA-approved vaccines.\n\nHe said that based on the current rate of vaccination, it will take a long time for the government to complete vaccinating all of its frontliners on the list, much less the general population.\n\n\u201cAs it stands, you have to register for your first dose and wait for your booking to be confirmed. All that adds up to make the waiting time much longer than it should be.\n\n\u201cIt is also important to note how the government\u2019s vaccine will be arriving in batches, extending the wait even longer,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to Kuljit, if private hospitals could procure their own vaccines, those who can afford the vaccines will be freeing up slots for those who can\u2019t afford it.\n\n\u201cAlthough some are understandably concerned with the issue of fairness, this is not the time to start any discussion on why the wealthier should get protected earlier than the rest.\u201d\n\nHe highlighted that the priority was to protect as many people against Covid-19 and as fast as possible.\n\n\u201cThere is no point having one group protected while the rest are not.\u201d\n\nOn the pricing for vaccinations, should the government give the necessary approval, Kuljit said there will be no profiteering involved.\n\n\u201cRest assured that we\u2019ll only be charging the market price for the vaccine. We\u2019re not trying to exploit the pandemic,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Press Club (NPC) is hopeful that discussions with the government will see media workers, including journalists and photographers, getting the Covid-19 vaccine as soon as possible.\n\nBernama reported NPC president Ahirudin Attan as saying that media workers are also frontline personnel who should be vaccinated in the initial phase as they go to the ground to cover the news and come face-to-face with the people.\n\nHe added that NPC is aware of the need for other frontliners to be given priority for Covid-19 jabs but wants media workers to receive the appropriate attention under the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR OUR LIVE UPDATE OF THE COVID-19 SITUATION IN MALAYSIA\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["vaccination", "let", "aphm", "vaccines", "competition", "workers", "procure", "private", "wants", "hospitals", "kuljit", "covid19", "vaccinated", "national", "vaccine"], "summary": "PETALING JAYA: The Association of Private Hospitals of Malaysia (APHM) wants the government to let private healthcare providers procure their own vaccines to help speed up the process of immunisation as it will benefit everyone.\nAPHM president Dr Kuljit Singh pointed out that there was no competition to see who can get vaccinated first nor was there any profit motive involved.\nHe said this in response to the government agreeing to rope in general practitioners to administer Covid-19 vaccines in phase two and three of the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme.\nWelcoming the move, Kuljit, however, urged the government to hasten the process by allowing private healthcare providers to procure their own NPRA-approved vaccines.\nAccording to Kuljit, if private hospitals could procure their own vaccines, those who can afford the vaccines will be freeing up slots for those who can\u2019t afford it.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "MKN\u2019s Official CMCO SOP As Of 10 March (In English)", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wMy8xMS9ta25zLW9mZmljaWFsLWNtY28tc29wLWFzLW9mLTEwLW1hcmNoLWluLWVuZ2xpc2gv0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlcmFreWF0cG9zdC5jb20vbmV3cy9tYWxheXNpYS8yMDIxLzAzLzExL21rbnMtb2ZmaWNpYWwtY21jby1zb3AtYXMtb2YtMTAtbWFyY2gtaW4tZW5nbGlzaC9hbXAv?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Hamzah Nazari", "Maya Suraya", "Azizul Rahman Ismail"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/CMCO.jpg", "text": "Subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates.\n\nFor your convenience, we\u2019ve translated to English the latest Conditional Movement Control Order (CMCO) standard operating procedure (SOP) released by the National Security Council (MKN).

Hospitals of Malaysia (APHM) wants the government to let private healthcare providers procure their own vaccines to help speed up the process of immunisation as it will benefit everyone.\n\nAPHM

where they can to help Malaysia get back on its feet,\u201d he said, adding that allowing private hospitals to buy their own vaccines would also free up slots in the national waiting list for those who can\u2019t afford to get vaccinated themselves.\n\nHe said this in response to the government agreeing to rope in general practitioners to administer Covid-19 vaccines in phase two and three of the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme.\n\nWelcoming the move, Kuljit, however, urged the government to hasten the process by allowing private healthcare providers to procure their own NPRA-approved vaccines.\n\nHe said that based on the current rate of vaccination, it will take a long time for the government to complete vaccinating all of its frontliners on the list, much less the general population.\n\n\u201cAs it stands, you have to register for your first dose and wait for your booking to be confirmed. All that adds up to make the waiting time much longer than it should be.\n\n\u201cIt is also important to note how the government\u2019s vaccine will be arriving in batches, extending the wait even longer,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to Kuljit, if private hospitals could procure their own vaccines, those who can afford the vaccines will be freeing up slots for those who can\u2019t afford it.\n\n\u201cAlthough some are understandably concerned with the issue of fairness, this is not the time to start any discussion on why the wealthier should get protected earlier than the rest.\u201d\n\nHe highlighted that the priority was to protect as many people against Covid-19 and as fast as possible.\n\n\u201cThere is no point having one group protected while the rest are not.\u201d\n\nOn the pricing for vaccinations, should the government give the necessary approval, Kuljit said there will be no profiteering involved.\n\n\u201cRest assured that we\u2019ll only be charging the market price for the vaccine.

the urban heat island effect, along with other factors such as lack of greenery which contributes to global warming.\n\nExperts say that the effect is mostly caused by building materials used in constructing buildings in urban areas with concrete and bitumen singled out as potential causes.\n\nThese materials are said to absorb and re-emits the sun\u2019s heat more than the natural
