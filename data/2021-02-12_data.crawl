Fraudulent offers and transactions also are increasing at an alarming rate,\u201d said its minister Dato Sri Alexander Nanta Linggi.\n\nHe said this in his text of speech delivered during the 2021 Malaysia Economic and Strategic Outlook Forum in Putrajaya recently.\n\nAdditionally, e-commerce platforms are also increasingly vulnerable to a growing illicit industry distributing harmful, unsafe, substandard or faulty products \u2013 including counterfeit and pirated products, he added.\n\nAs much as 50 per cent of drugs sold through online pharmacies are counterfeits containing the wrong ingredients; random mixtures of noxious chemicals; insufficient, too much or no active ingredients; or fake packaging.\n\nIn Malaysia, there has been a total of 2,997 cases of counterfeit products reported from 2017 to 2020.\n\nCounterfeit items seized during operations included products such as food items, medicines, cosmetics electrical devices, clothing and luxury items, he added.\n\nThere has also been an increase of 112.5 per cent of online transactions complaints lodged at KPDNHEP in 2020, compared to 2019 (5,416 nos of complaints).\n\n\u201cThe upwards trend can be contributed to the change of purchasing methods \u2013 from the traditional brick-and-mortar purchases to the online platform purchases. This shows that majority of consumers in Malaysia have already adapted to the new norm of Covid-19 through their daily online transactions.\u201d\n\nNanta said these widespread online activities to target and deceive consumers present significant challenges for government and businesses to investigate and stop the flow of fake and unsafe goods.\n\n\u201cWith the prevalence of the Covid-19 pandemic, many have opted for online shopping as their primary shopping method to satisfy their buying needs while attempting to keep safe from the virus.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs more and more online retailers emerge in this ever-growing and ever-advancing market, the number of online shoppers has increased as well.\u201d\n\nAs a result, instances of online retailers taking advantage of their customers using unethical or even illegal advertising or marketing tactics to attract more customers has also increased as well, he said.\n\nHe said online retailers have many ways to increase their chances of profit-making by using pricing strategies such as \u2018yo-yo pricing\u2019 (which is increasing the price of their products when supply is low and then decreasing the price after the supply increases) and \u2018predatory pricing\u2019.\n\n\u201cPredatory pricing occurs when online businesses lower the price of their products below the manufacturing cost in hopes that it will drive their competitors out of business.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother strategy that is often deployed is when unscrupulous retailers mislead customers or consumers through \u2018fake\u2019 or misleading discounts, which many consumers are unaware of,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis was rumoured to have happened recently during the highly-anticipated yearly nationwide \u201811.11\u2019, Black Friday, and \u201912.12\u2019 sales.\u201d\n\nConsumers however can protect themselves when faced with misleading advertisements or representations by online businesses by filing a complaint with the e-commerce platforms directly.\n\nMany E-commerce platforms such as Shopee and Lazada have their own policies for dealing with misleading discounts, he said.\n\nFor example, Shopee prohibits price manipulation and fake discounts as they create a false impression of the product prices. Listings with misleading discounts will be suspended by Shopee for a first offence, with no penalty as a warning, he explained.\n\nHowever, he said, if there is any subsequent offence by the seller in the future, all listings found with the behaviour of misleading discounts will be deleted as it would be a \u2018Prohibited Listing\u2019.\n\nSimilarly, sellers on Lazada are not allowed to offer misleading discounts during the campaign period such as 11.11, 12.12 among others, he added.\n\nLazada may remove the products from listing if the sellers are found to be in breach of the policy, said Nanta.\n\nAggrieved consumers can also choose to lodge their complaints \u2013 either to the KPDNHEP Consumer Complaints Management Centre (or the PPAP) or the National Consumer Complaints Centre (NCCC) or the Ministry itself.\n\nPPAP is the official ministry\u2019s complaints channel and can be reached via the hotline 1-800-886-800, the e-Aduan system, e-mails, WhatsApp application and walk-in complainants.", "keyword": ["rise", "fraud", "misleading", "price", "complaints", "retailers", "kpdnhep", "theft", "cases", "consumers", "online", "discounts", "fake", "identity", "products"], "summary": "KUCHING (Feb 24): The Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumers Affairs (KPDNHEP) said cases of identity theft, theft of credit card information and fraudulent offers and transactions are increasing at alarming rates.\nMany E-commerce platforms such as Shopee and Lazada have their own policies for dealing with misleading discounts, he said.\nFor example, Shopee prohibits price manipulation and fake discounts as they create a false impression of the product prices.\nListings with misleading discounts will be suspended by Shopee for a first offence, with no penalty as a warning, he explained.\nSimilarly, sellers on Lazada are not allowed to offer misleading discounts during the campaign period such as 11.11, 12.12 among others, he added.", "news": "The Borneo Post", "date": "2021-02-24 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Complaints on online transactions rise 112.5%", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWFsYXlzaWFucmVzZXJ2ZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi8yMy9jb21wbGFpbnRzLW9uLW9ubGluZS10cmFuc2FjdGlvbnMtcmlzZS0xMTItNS_SAVxodHRwczovL3RoZW1hbGF5c2lhbnJlc2VydmUuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvMjMvY29tcGxhaW50cy1vbi1vbmxpbmUtdHJhbnNhY3Rpb25zLXJpc2UtMTEyLTUvYW1wLw?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://themalaysianreserve.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/19TR004A1-1.jpg", "text": "by LYDIA NATHAN / Pic by RAZAK GHAZALI\n\nTHE Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) has recorded an increase of 112.5% in complaints last year, compared to 5,416 complaints in 2019, vastly due to the shift from traditional brick-and-mortar purchases to online platforms.\n\nMinister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi (picture) said as online retailers are mushrooming, so have unethical or even illegal advertising and marketing tactics to attract more customers.\n\n\u201cThere are many ways to increase profit-making, like \u2018yo-yo pricing\u2019 \u2014 which is increasing prices when there is low supply, but decreasing it when supply is plenty,\u201d he said yesterday at 2021 Malaysia Economic and Strategic Outlook Forum entitled \u201cThe Post-Covid New Normal \u2014 Where Do We Go from Here\u201d.\n\nNanta Linggi said the complaints also included predatory pricing, or lowering prices below manufacturing costs in an aim to drive competitors out of business.\n\n\u201cAnother strategy often deployed is when retailers mislead consumers through fake discounts, which allegedly took place during the highly anticipated 11.11, Black Friday and 12.12 nationwide sales,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Nanta Linggi, even though e-commerce has proven to be convenient and the choice for most, it has also presented consumers with risks, including identity theft and credit card fraud.\n\n\u201cFraudulent offers and transactions are also increasing at alarming rates.

several major players in the creative industry, digital piracy has also robbed the government off some RM500 million in government taxes while putting thousands of jobs at risk.\n\nStar Media Group chief marketing officer Lam Swee Kim said the penalty being imposed should reflect how severe the act of piracy impacts the industry and the act of fuelling piracy in terms of monetisation or remuneration should also be monitored and penalised.\n\nThe authorities are also urged to take action against key enablers of digital piracy by blocking illegal streaming sites over the Internet and

The penalty should be heavier. The value of content being pirated is definitely higher than the fine of only RM30,000,\u201d Zahrin said.\n\nEradicating digital piracy requires collaborative efforts by all parties from content providers, broadcasters, regulators, authorities and consumers to telecommunication companies, Internet service and e-commerce providers.

Affairs (KPDNHEP) said cases of identity theft, theft of credit card information and fraudulent offers and transactions are increasing at alarming rates.\n\n\u201cWhile e-commerce is delivering unprecedented product choice, convenience and price transparency, it also presents consumers with a number of new risks, such as identity theft and theft of credit card information. Fraudulent offers and transactions also are increasing at an alarming rate,\u201d said its minister Dato Sri Alexander Nanta Linggi.\n\nHe said this in his text of speech delivered during the 2021 Malaysia Economic and Strategic Outlook Forum in Putrajaya recently.\n\nAdditionally, e-commerce platforms are also increasingly vulnerable to a growing illicit industry distributing harmful, unsafe, substandard or faulty products \u2013 including counterfeit and pirated products, he added.\n\nAs much as 50 per cent of drugs sold through online pharmacies are counterfeits containing the wrong ingredients; random mixtures of noxious chemicals; insufficient, too much or no active ingredients; or fake packaging.\n\nIn Malaysia, there has been a total of 2,997 cases of counterfeit products reported from 2017 to 2020.\n\nCounterfeit items seized during operations included products such as food items, medicines, cosmetics electrical devices, clothing and luxury items, he added.\n\nThere has also been an increase of 112.5 per cent of online transactions complaints lodged at KPDNHEP in 2020, compared to 2019 (5,416 nos of complaints).\n\n\u201cThe upwards trend can be contributed to the change of purchasing methods \u2013 from the traditional brick-and-mortar purchases to the online platform purchases. This shows that majority of consumers in Malaysia have already adapted to the new norm of Covid-19 through their daily online transactions.\u201d\n\nNanta said these widespread online activities to target and deceive consumers present significant challenges for government and businesses to investigate and stop the flow of fake and unsafe goods.\n\n\u201cWith the prevalence of the Covid-19 pandemic, many have opted for online shopping as their primary shopping method to satisfy their buying needs while attempting to keep safe from the virus.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs more and more online retailers emerge in this ever-growing and ever-advancing market, the number of online shoppers has increased as well.\u201d\n\nAs a result, instances of online retailers taking advantage of their customers using unethical or even illegal advertising or marketing tactics to attract more customers has also increased as well, he said.\n\nHe said online retailers have many ways to increase their chances of profit-making by using pricing strategies such as \u2018yo-yo pricing\u2019 (which is increasing the price of their products when supply is low and then decreasing the price after the supply increases) and \u2018predatory pricing\u2019.\n\n\u201cPredatory pricing occurs when online businesses lower the price of their products below the manufacturing cost in hopes that it will drive their competitors out of business.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother strategy that is often deployed is when unscrupulous retailers mislead customers or consumers through \u2018fake\u2019 or misleading discounts, which many consumers are unaware of,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis was rumoured to have happened recently during the highly-anticipated yearly nationwide \u201811.11\u2019, Black Friday, and \u201912.12\u2019 sales.\u201d\n\nConsumers however can protect themselves when faced with misleading advertisements or representations by online businesses by filing a complaint with the e-commerce platforms directly.\n\nMany E-commerce platforms such as Shopee and Lazada have their own policies for dealing with misleading discounts, he said.\n\nFor example, Shopee prohibits price manipulation and fake discounts as they create a false impression of the product prices.

digital piracy and infringement of creative rights does not seem to be commensurate with the losses of up to RM3 billion that content providers have to endure.\n\nAccording to a joint statement by several major players in the creative industry, digital piracy has also robbed the government off some RM500 million in government taxes while putting thousands of jobs at risk.\n\nStar Media Group chief marketing officer Lam Swee Kim said the penalty being imposed should reflect how severe the act of piracy impacts the industry and the act of fuelling piracy in terms of monetisation or remuneration should also be monitored and penalised.\n\nThe authorities are also urged to take action against key enablers of digital piracy by blocking illegal streaming sites over the Internet and illicit streaming devices (ISDs) that are being openly sold on e-commerce platforms.\n\nMalaysian Film Producers Association honorary secretary Zahrin Aris said the penalty is too light and needs to be heavier.\n\n\u201cThe penalty for those who use media boxes loaded with unauthorised apps is too light. The penalty should be heavier. The value of content being pirated is definitely higher than the fine of only RM30,000,\u201d Zahrin said.\n\nEradicating digital piracy requires collaborative efforts by all parties from content providers, broadcasters, regulators, authorities and consumers to telecommunication companies, Internet service and e-commerce providers. Such effort would only allow responsible content to be streamed.\n\nOn Feb 8, 2021, an IT company was the first to be charged in court under Section 41(1)(ha) of the Copyright Act 1987 for selling technology or equipment for the purpose of the circumvention of technological protection measure referred to in subsection 36A(3) of the same Act.\n\nThe action was spearheaded by the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs deputy public prosecutor.\n\nThe company\u2019s director has pleaded guilty and is currently awaiting the court\u2019s sentence.\n\nIn the same month, a 46-year-old woman was charged with the possession of six media television boxes, allowing the illegal streaming of Astro\u2019s content via the Internet.\n\nThe accused was fined RM30,000 under Section 232(2) of the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998, making her the ISD seller to be charged under this provision.\n\nThe stern action is lauded by the local content industry as a great move to curb digital piracy that has been happening in the country for a while now.\n\nProducer and director Datuk Yusof Haslam said without the resolve and effort of relevant authorities, the crimes would not have been stopped.\n\n\u201cThis act of theft is not new and has to be resolved by the authorities. I regret to see empty rhetoric without a real solution to the problem. Without stricter regulations, piracy will continue to be cancer to the creative industry and its talents,\u201d he said.\n\nAstro regulatory director Laila Saat said the industry also welcomes the recent charges brought against sellers of ISD and will continue working with authorities in sending out the message.\n\n\u201cPiracy has become so pervasive that many have forgotten that it is theft and is the biggest scourge of the industry, stealing from every single person in the creative ecosystem from actors, writers, producers, directors and cameramen, thus hampering development.\n\n\u201cIf piracy is left unchecked, it will retard the entertainment industry as it doesn\u2019t make economic sense for anyone to create or invest in premium content,\u201d Laila said.", "keyword": ["authorities", "higher", "piracy", "act", "creative", "penalties", "needed", "streaming", "providers", "penalty", "industry", "content", "digital"], "summary": "According to a joint statement by several major players in the creative industry, digital piracy has also robbed the government off some RM500 million in government taxes while putting thousands of jobs at risk.\nThe authorities are also urged to take action against key enablers of digital piracy by blocking illegal streaming sites over the Internet and illicit streaming devices (ISDs) that are being openly sold on e-commerce platforms.\nEradicating digital piracy requires collaborative efforts by all parties from content providers, broadcasters, regulators, authorities and consumers to telecommunication companies, Internet service and e-commerce providers.\nThe stern action is lauded by the local content industry as a great move to curb digital piracy that has been happening in the country for a while now.\nWithout stricter regulations, piracy will continue to be cancer to the creative industry and its talents,\u201d he said.", "news": "The Malaysian Reserve", "date": "2021-02-24 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Old enough to die for country but too young to vote?", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wMi8xOC9vbGQtZW5vdWdoLXRvLWRpZS1mb3ItY291bnRyeS1idXQtdG9vLXlvdW5nLXRvLXZvdGUv0gEA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Minderjeet Kaur"], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Students-UTM-MJIIT-Parliament-111019-FMT.jpg", "text": "PETALING JAYA: Should 18-year-olds, who can legally drive and get married, be allowed to vote?\n\nThe law allowing 18-year-old Malaysians to vote and even stand as election candidates was passed and gazetted in 2019 but has yet to be implemented.\n\nWan Ahmad Fayhsal Wan Ahmad Kamal, the deputy minister of youth and sports, got an argument going when he said that youths were not mature enough to vote and needed to be educated before being allowed to do so.\n\nThe right to vote should come with the moral duty to do so judiciously, he said.\n\nTwo analysts FMT spoke to disagreed but another supported the deputy minister\u2019s opinion.\n\nKenneth Cheng of the Agora Society, a loose network of intellectuals, noted that 18-year-olds were considered old enough to join the army.\n\n\u201cIf they can die for their country, why question their knowledge?\u201d he said.\n\nCheng questioned the sensitivity of those saying youths need more education before voting, pointing out that reading materials on current issues as well as on the responsibilities of voters were freely available on the internet.\n\nMoreover, he said, it would be naive to imagine that all older people were well equipped intellectually to decide whom to vote for.\n\nHowever, Cheng also said most voters, whether literate or illiterate, were aware of the issues affecting their daily lives and the young in a maturing society should be even better at thinking for themselves.\n\nHe said schools were teaching about voting rights as part of the history syllabus and students could learn more through the internet.\n\nIt smacked of a discriminatory attitude to assume that students were not educated enough on voting rights and responsibilities, he added.\n\nAwang Azman Pawi of Universiti Malaya also referred to lessons on voting rights in the history syllabus and said that students were learning about ethics through moral and religious studies.\n\nMost countries, he said, allowed the young to vote and Malaysia should not backpedal into questioning the political literacy of the young.\n\nHe said politicians who were raising doubts about the voting knowledge of 18-year-olds could be doing so out of their fear of anti-establishment youths.\n\n\u201cBut youths do not care about a political party\u2019s ideology. For them it is about education, scholarships, training and jobs.\u201d\n\nAwang Azman also said youths wanted political parties to be free from corruption and might look for a third force if they were unhappy with ruling parties as well as with the established opposition.\n\n\u201cThese requirements may frighten some political parties,\u201d he said.\n\nFormer academic Azmi Hassan agrees with Wan Fayhsal, saying university students were lacking in the critical thinking needed to make decisions.\n\n\u201cWhen we ask them critical or general knowledge questions, they find it hard to answer because of a lack of knowledge.\n\n\u201cI am not sure if those aged 18 to 21 can make decisions based on knowledge or on just their whims and fancies,\u201d he said.\n\nHe urged the education ministry to introduce critical thinking and general knowledge courses from Primary One to tertiary-level.\n\nThe Undi 18 bill, officially known as Constitution (Amendment) Bill 2019, was passed by the Dewan Negara in July 2019 and gazetted two months later.\n\nOn Tuesday, Umno information chief Shahril Hamdan urged the government to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d and allow the voting age to be lowered to 18.\n\nHe said the government should be \u201cgentlemanly enough\u201d and not change its stance on the issue \u201cjust because young voters are not in favour of the ruling party\u201d.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["thinking", "students", "voters", "rights", "voting", "youths", "knowledge", "old", "country", "die", "political", "young", "vote"], "summary": "He said schools were teaching about voting rights as part of the history syllabus and students could learn more through the internet.\nIt smacked of a discriminatory attitude to assume that students were not educated enough on voting rights and responsibilities, he added.\nMost countries, he said, allowed the young to vote and Malaysia should not backpedal into questioning the political literacy of the young.\nHe said politicians who were raising doubts about the voting knowledge of 18-year-olds could be doing so out of their fear of anti-establishment youths.\nHe said the government should be \u201cgentlemanly enough\u201d and not change its stance on the issue \u201cjust because young voters are not in favour of the ruling party\u201d.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-02-18 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "MKN\u2019s Official MCO 2.0 SOP As Of 18 Feb (In English)", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wMi8xOS9ta25zLW9mZmljaWFsLW1jby0yLTAtc29wLWFzLW9mLTE4LWZlYi1pbi1lbmdsaXNoL9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wMi8xOS9ta25zLW9mZmljaWFsLW1jby0yLTAtc29wLWFzLW9mLTE4LWZlYi1pbi1lbmdsaXNoL2FtcC8?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Hamzah Nazari", "Maya Suraya", "Azizul Rahman Ismail"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mco-roadblock-feature-image.jpg", "text": "Subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates.\n\nFor your convenience, we\u2019ve translated to English the latest Movement Control Order (MCO) standard operating procedure (SOP) released by the National Security Council (MKN).

unprecedented product choice, convenience and price transparency, it also presents consumers with a number of new risks, such as identity theft and theft of credit card information. Fraudulent offers and transactions also are increasing at an alarming rate,\u201d said its minister Dato Sri Alexander Nanta Linggi.\n\nHe said this in his text of speech delivered during the 2021 Malaysia Economic and Strategic Outlook Forum in Putrajaya recently.\n\nAdditionally, e-commerce platforms are also increasingly vulnerable to a growing illicit industry distributing harmful, unsafe, substandard or faulty products \u2013 including counterfeit and pirated products, he added.\n\nAs much as 50 per cent of drugs sold through online pharmacies are counterfeits containing the wrong ingredients; random mixtures of noxious chemicals; insufficient, too much or no active ingredients; or fake packaging.\n\nIn Malaysia, there has been a total of 2,997 cases of counterfeit products reported from 2017 to 2020.\n\nCounterfeit items seized during operations included products such as food items, medicines, cosmetics electrical devices, clothing and luxury items, he added.\n\nThere has also been an increase of 112.5 per cent of online transactions complaints lodged at KPDNHEP in 2020, compared to 2019 (5,416 nos of complaints).\n\n\u201cThe upwards trend can be contributed to the change of purchasing methods \u2013 from the traditional brick-and-mortar purchases to the online platform purchases. This shows that majority of consumers in Malaysia have already adapted to the new norm of Covid-19 through their daily online transactions.\u201d\n\nNanta said these widespread online activities to target and deceive consumers present significant challenges for government and businesses to investigate and stop the flow of fake and unsafe goods.\n\n\u201cWith the prevalence of the Covid-19 pandemic, many have opted for online shopping as their primary shopping method to satisfy their buying needs while attempting to keep safe from the virus.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs more and more online retailers emerge in this ever-growing and ever-advancing market, the number of online shoppers has increased as well.\u201d\n\nAs a result, instances of online retailers taking advantage of their customers using unethical or even illegal advertising or marketing tactics to attract more customers has also increased as well, he said.\n\nHe said online retailers have many ways to increase their chances of profit-making by using pricing strategies such as \u2018yo-yo pricing\u2019 (which is increasing the price of their products when supply is low and then decreasing the price after the supply increases) and \u2018predatory pricing\u2019.\n\n\u201cPredatory pricing occurs when online businesses lower the price of their products below the manufacturing cost in hopes that it will drive their competitors out of business.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother strategy that is often deployed is when unscrupulous retailers mislead customers or consumers through \u2018fake\u2019 or misleading discounts, which many consumers are unaware of,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis was rumoured to have happened recently during the highly-anticipated yearly nationwide \u201811.11\u2019, Black Friday, and \u201912.12\u2019 sales.\u201d\n\nConsumers however can protect themselves when faced with misleading advertisements or representations by online businesses by filing a complaint with the e-commerce platforms directly.\n\nMany E-commerce platforms such as Shopee and Lazada have their own policies for dealing with misleading discounts, he said.\n\nFor example, Shopee prohibits price manipulation and fake discounts as they create a false impression of the product prices. Listings with misleading discounts will be suspended by Shopee for a first offence, with no penalty as a warning, he explained.\n\nHowever, he said, if there is any subsequent offence by the seller in the future, all listings found with the behaviour of misleading discounts will be deleted as it would be a \u2018Prohibited Listing\u2019.\n\nSimilarly, sellers on Lazada are not allowed to offer misleading discounts during the campaign period such as 11.11, 12.12 among others, he added.\n\nLazada may remove the products from listing if the sellers are found to be in breach of the policy, said Nanta.\n\nAggrieved consumers can also choose to lodge their complaints \u2013 either to the KPDNHEP Consumer Complaints Management Centre (or the PPAP) or the National Consumer Complaints Centre (NCCC) or the Ministry itself.\n\nPPAP is the official ministry\u2019s complaints channel and can be reached via the hotline 1-800-886-800, the e-Aduan system, e-mails, WhatsApp application and walk-in complainants.", "keyword": ["rise", "fraud", "misleading", "price", "complaints", "retailers", "kpdnhep", "theft", "cases", "consumers", "online", "discounts", "fake", "identity", "products"], "summary": "KUCHING (Feb 24): The Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumers Affairs (KPDNHEP) said cases of identity theft, theft of credit card information and fraudulent offers and transactions are increasing at alarming rates.\nMany E-commerce platforms such as Shopee and Lazada have their own policies for dealing with misleading discounts, he said.\nFor example, Shopee prohibits price manipulation and fake discounts as they create a false impression of the product prices.\nListings with misleading discounts will be suspended by Shopee for a first offence, with no penalty as a warning, he explained.\nSimilarly, sellers on Lazada are not allowed to offer misleading discounts during the campaign period such as 11.11, 12.12 among others, he added.", "news": "The Borneo Post", "date": "2021-02-24 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Complaints on online transactions rise 112.5%", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWFsYXlzaWFucmVzZXJ2ZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi8yMy9jb21wbGFpbnRzLW9uLW9ubGluZS10cmFuc2FjdGlvbnMtcmlzZS0xMTItNS_SAVxodHRwczovL3RoZW1hbGF5c2lhbnJlc2VydmUuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvMjMvY29tcGxhaW50cy1vbi1vbmxpbmUtdHJhbnNhY3Rpb25zLXJpc2UtMTEyLTUvYW1wLw?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://themalaysianreserve.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/19TR004A1-1.jpg", "text": "by LYDIA NATHAN / Pic by RAZAK GHAZALI\n\nTHE Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) has recorded an increase of 112.5% in complaints last year, compared to 5,416 complaints in 2019, vastly due to the shift from traditional brick-and-mortar purchases to online platforms.\n\nMinister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi (picture) said as online retailers are mushrooming, so have unethical or even illegal advertising and marketing tactics to attract more customers.\n\n\u201cThere are many ways to increase profit-making, like \u2018yo-yo pricing\u2019 \u2014 which is increasing prices when there is low supply, but decreasing it when supply is plenty,\u201d he said yesterday at 2021 Malaysia Economic and Strategic Outlook Forum entitled \u201cThe Post-Covid New Normal \u2014 Where Do We Go from Here\u201d.\n\nNanta Linggi said the complaints also included predatory pricing, or lowering prices below manufacturing costs in an aim to drive competitors out of business.\n\n\u201cAnother strategy often deployed is when retailers mislead consumers through fake discounts, which allegedly took place during the highly anticipated 11.11, Black Friday and 12.12 nationwide sales,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Nanta Linggi, even though e-commerce has proven to be convenient and the choice for most, it has also presented consumers with risks, including identity theft and credit card fraud.\n\n\u201cFraudulent offers and transactions are also increasing at alarming rates.

digital piracy and infringement of creative rights does not seem to be commensurate with the losses of up to RM3 billion that content providers have to endure.\n\nAccording to a joint statement by several major players in the creative industry, digital piracy has also robbed the government off some RM500 million in government taxes while putting thousands of jobs at risk.\n\nStar Media Group chief marketing officer Lam Swee Kim said the penalty being imposed should reflect how severe the act of piracy impacts the industry and the act of fuelling piracy in terms of monetisation or remuneration should also be monitored and penalised.\n\nThe authorities are also urged to take action against key enablers of digital piracy by blocking illegal streaming sites over the Internet and illicit streaming devices (ISDs) that are being openly sold on e-commerce platforms.\n\nMalaysian Film Producers Association honorary secretary Zahrin Aris said the penalty is too light and needs to be heavier.\n\n\u201cThe penalty for those who use media boxes loaded with unauthorised apps is too light. The penalty should be heavier. The value of content being pirated is definitely higher than the fine of only RM30,000,\u201d Zahrin said.\n\nEradicating digital piracy requires collaborative efforts by all parties from content providers, broadcasters, regulators, authorities and consumers to telecommunication companies, Internet service and e-commerce providers.

For them it is about education, scholarships, training and jobs.\u201d\n\nAwang Azman also said youths wanted political parties to be free from corruption and might look for a third force if they were unhappy with ruling parties as well as with the established opposition.\n\n\u201cThese requirements may frighten some political parties,\u201d he said.\n\nFormer academic Azmi Hassan agrees with Wan Fayhsal, saying university students were lacking in the critical thinking needed to make decisions.\n\n\u201cWhen we ask them critical or general knowledge questions, they find it hard to answer because of a lack of knowledge.\n\n\u201cI am not sure if those aged 18 to 21 can make decisions based on knowledge or on just their whims and fancies,\u201d he said.\n\nHe urged the education ministry to introduce critical thinking and general knowledge courses from Primary One to tertiary-level.\n\nThe Undi 18 bill, officially known as Constitution (Amendment) Bill 2019, was passed by the Dewan Negara in July 2019 and gazetted two months later.\n\nOn Tuesday, Umno information chief Shahril Hamdan urged the government to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d and allow the voting age to be lowered to 18.\n\nHe said the government should be \u201cgentlemanly enough\u201d and not change its stance on the issue \u201cjust because young voters are not in favour of the ruling party\u201d.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["thinking", "students", "voters", "rights", "voting", "youths", "knowledge", "old", "country", "die", "political", "young", "vote"], "summary": "He said schools were teaching about voting rights as part of the history syllabus and students could learn more through the internet.\nIt smacked of a discriminatory attitude to assume that students were not educated enough on voting rights and responsibilities, he added.\nMost countries, he said, allowed the young to vote and Malaysia should not backpedal into questioning the political literacy of the young.\nHe said politicians who were raising doubts about the voting knowledge of 18-year-olds could be doing so out of their fear of anti-establishment youths.\nHe said the government should be \u201cgentlemanly enough\u201d and not change its stance on the issue \u201cjust because young voters are not in favour of the ruling party\u201d.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-02-18 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "MKN\u2019s Official MCO 2.0 SOP As Of 18 Feb (In English)", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wMi8xOS9ta25zLW9mZmljaWFsLW1jby0yLTAtc29wLWFzLW9mLTE4LWZlYi1pbi1lbmdsaXNoL9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wMi8xOS9ta25zLW9mZmljaWFsLW1jby0yLTAtc29wLWFzLW9mLTE4LWZlYi1pbi1lbmdsaXNoL2FtcC8?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Hamzah Nazari", "Maya Suraya", "Azizul Rahman Ismail"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mco-roadblock-feature-image.jpg", "text": "Subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates.\n\nFor your convenience, we\u2019ve translated to English the latest Movement Control Order (MCO) standard operating procedure (SOP) released by the National Security Council (MKN).

little went Juventus\u2019s way, Federico Chiesa\u2019s late strike at least handed them a lifeline going into the return leg in Turin on March 9.\n\nTaremi pounced on a sloppy back pass after 63 seconds to fire in the opener that left Juventus rattled as they failed to create any meaningful chances before halftime.\n\nThings got worse for Andrea Pirlo\u2019s side when Marega blasted in Porto\u2019s second 19 seconds into the second half.\n\nJuventus eventually mustered a response when Chiesa fired home a precious away goal with eight minutes remaining, but it was not enough to stop the 2004 champions from celebrating their first victory over the Italian club at the sixth attempt.\n\nThe winger\u2019s strike ended Porto\u2019s run of five consecutive clean sheets in the competition and leaves the tie wide open ahead of the return leg.\n\nJuve impressed in the group stage by winning five games from six, including a 3-0 final day victory at Barcelona.\n\nBut they got off to the worst start possible when Taremi anticipated Rodrigo Bentancur\u2019s pass back to Wojciech Szczesny and slid in to shoot past the goalkeeper from close range.\n\nJuve were visibly knocked off their stride by the aggression of Porto\u2019s pressing and were almost caught out again when Szczesny cleared the ball straight to Sergio Oliveira, whose shot was deflected wide.\n\nMatters were made worse for the Turin club when captain Giorgio Chiellini limped off with injury after 34 minutes.\n\nPorto were even quicker out of the blocks in the second half as Marega got on the end of a Wilson Manafa cutback to fire home within seconds of the restart.\n\nSzczesny stuck out a hand to stop an Oliveira shot from making it three, but the visitors finally came to life in the final 20 minutes.\n\nAgustin Marchesin had to scramble to palm away a deflected Chiesa shot, before the Italy international raced onto a pass to cushion a finish into the corner.\n\nThe goal made Chiesa the first Juventus player other than Cristiano Ronaldo to score a knockout stage goal in the Champions League since Blaise Matuidi in April 2018.\n\nRonaldo, the competition\u2019s all-time top scorer,

Affairs (KPDNHEP) said cases of identity theft, theft of credit card information and fraudulent offers and transactions are increasing at alarming rates.\n\n\u201cWhile e-commerce is delivering unprecedented product choice, convenience and price transparency, it also presents consumers with a number of new risks, such as identity theft and theft of credit card information. Fraudulent offers and transactions also are increasing at an alarming rate,\u201d said its minister Dato Sri Alexander Nanta Linggi.\n\nHe said this in his text of speech delivered during the 2021 Malaysia Economic and Strategic Outlook Forum in Putrajaya recently.\n\nAdditionally, e-commerce platforms are also increasingly vulnerable to a growing illicit industry distributing harmful, unsafe, substandard or faulty products \u2013 including counterfeit and pirated products, he added.\n\nAs much as 50 per cent of drugs sold through online pharmacies are counterfeits containing the wrong ingredients; random mixtures of noxious chemicals; insufficient, too much or no active ingredients; or fake packaging.\n\nIn Malaysia, there has been a total of 2,997 cases of counterfeit products reported from 2017 to 2020.\n\nCounterfeit items seized during operations included products such as food items, medicines, cosmetics electrical devices, clothing and luxury items, he added.\n\nThere has also been an increase of 112.5 per cent of online transactions complaints lodged at KPDNHEP in 2020, compared to 2019 (5,416 nos of complaints).\n\n\u201cThe upwards trend can be contributed to the change of purchasing methods \u2013 from the traditional brick-and-mortar purchases to the online platform purchases. This shows that majority of consumers in Malaysia have already adapted to the new norm of Covid-19 through their daily online transactions.\u201d\n\nNanta said these widespread online activities to target and deceive consumers present significant challenges for government and businesses to investigate and stop the flow of fake and unsafe goods.\n\n\u201cWith the prevalence of the Covid-19 pandemic, many have opted for online shopping as their primary shopping method to satisfy their buying needs while attempting to keep safe from the virus.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs more and more online retailers emerge in this ever-growing and ever-advancing market, the number of online shoppers has increased as well.\u201d\n\nAs a result, instances of online retailers taking advantage of their customers using unethical or even illegal advertising or marketing tactics to attract more customers has also increased as well, he said.\n\nHe said online retailers have many ways to increase their chances of profit-making by using pricing strategies such as \u2018yo-yo pricing\u2019 (which is increasing the price of their products when supply is low and then decreasing the price after the supply increases) and \u2018predatory pricing\u2019.\n\n\u201cPredatory pricing occurs when online businesses lower the price of their products below the manufacturing cost in hopes that it will drive their competitors out of business.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother strategy that is often deployed is when unscrupulous retailers mislead customers or consumers through \u2018fake\u2019 or misleading discounts, which many consumers are unaware of,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis was rumoured to have happened recently during the highly-anticipated yearly nationwide \u201811.11\u2019, Black Friday, and \u201912.12\u2019 sales.\u201d\n\nConsumers however can protect themselves when faced with misleading advertisements or representations by online businesses by filing a complaint with the e-commerce platforms directly.\n\nMany E-commerce platforms such as Shopee and Lazada have their own policies for dealing with misleading discounts, he said.\n\nFor example, Shopee prohibits price manipulation and fake discounts as they create a false impression of the product prices. Listings with misleading discounts will be suspended by Shopee for a first offence, with no penalty as a warning, he explained.\n\nHowever, he said, if there is any subsequent offence by the seller in the future, all listings found with the behaviour of misleading discounts will be deleted as it would be a \u2018Prohibited Listing\u2019.\n\nSimilarly, sellers on Lazada are not allowed to offer misleading discounts during the campaign period such as 11.11, 12.12 among others, he added.\n\nLazada may remove the products from listing if the sellers are found to be in breach of the policy, said Nanta.\n\nAggrieved consumers can also choose to lodge their complaints \u2013 either to the KPDNHEP Consumer Complaints Management Centre (or the PPAP) or the National Consumer Complaints Centre (NCCC) or the Ministry itself.\n\nPPAP is the official ministry\u2019s complaints channel and can be reached via the hotline 1-800-886-800, the e-Aduan system, e-mails, WhatsApp application and walk-in complainants.", "keyword": ["rise", "fraud", "misleading", "price", "complaints", "retailers", "kpdnhep", "theft", "cases", "consumers", "online", "discounts", "fake", "identity", "products"], "summary": "KUCHING (Feb 24): The Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumers Affairs (KPDNHEP) said cases of identity theft, theft of credit card information and fraudulent offers and transactions are increasing at alarming rates.\nMany E-commerce platforms such as Shopee and Lazada have their own policies for dealing with misleading discounts, he said.\nFor example, Shopee prohibits price manipulation and fake discounts as they create a false impression of the product prices.\nListings with misleading discounts will be suspended by Shopee for a first offence, with no penalty as a warning, he explained.\nSimilarly, sellers on Lazada are not allowed to offer misleading discounts during the campaign period such as 11.11, 12.12 among others, he added.", "news": "The Borneo Post", "date": "2021-02-24 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Complaints on online transactions rise 112.5%", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWFsYXlzaWFucmVzZXJ2ZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi8yMy9jb21wbGFpbnRzLW9uLW9ubGluZS10cmFuc2FjdGlvbnMtcmlzZS0xMTItNS_SAVxodHRwczovL3RoZW1hbGF5c2lhbnJlc2VydmUuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvMjMvY29tcGxhaW50cy1vbi1vbmxpbmUtdHJhbnNhY3Rpb25zLXJpc2UtMTEyLTUvYW1wLw?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://themalaysianreserve.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/19TR004A1-1.jpg", "text": "by LYDIA NATHAN / Pic by RAZAK GHAZALI\n\nTHE Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) has recorded an increase of 112.5% in complaints last year, compared to 5,416 complaints in 2019, vastly due to the shift from traditional brick-and-mortar purchases to online platforms.\n\nMinister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi (picture) said as online retailers are mushrooming, so have unethical or even illegal advertising and marketing tactics to attract more customers.\n\n\u201cThere are many ways to increase profit-making, like \u2018yo-yo pricing\u2019 \u2014 which is increasing prices when there is low supply, but decreasing it when supply is plenty,\u201d he said yesterday at 2021 Malaysia Economic and Strategic Outlook Forum entitled \u201cThe Post-Covid New Normal \u2014 Where Do We Go from Here\u201d.\n\nNanta Linggi said the complaints also included predatory pricing, or lowering prices below manufacturing costs in an aim to drive competitors out of business.\n\n\u201cAnother strategy often deployed is when retailers mislead consumers through fake discounts, which allegedly took place during the highly anticipated 11.11, Black Friday and 12.12 nationwide sales,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Nanta Linggi, even though e-commerce has proven to be convenient and the choice for most, it has also presented consumers with risks, including identity theft and credit card fraud.\n\n\u201cFraudulent offers and transactions are also increasing at alarming rates.

several major players in the creative industry, digital piracy has also robbed the government off some RM500 million in government taxes while putting thousands of jobs at risk.\n\nStar Media Group chief marketing officer Lam Swee Kim said the penalty being imposed should reflect how severe the act of piracy impacts the industry and the act of fuelling piracy in terms of monetisation or remuneration should also be monitored and penalised.\n\nThe authorities are also urged to take action against key enablers of digital piracy by blocking illegal streaming sites over the Internet and

The penalty should be heavier. The value of content being pirated is definitely higher than the fine of only RM30,000,\u201d Zahrin said.\n\nEradicating digital piracy requires collaborative efforts by all parties from content providers, broadcasters, regulators, authorities and consumers to telecommunication companies, Internet service and e-commerce providers.

Affairs (KPDNHEP) said cases of identity theft, theft of credit card information and fraudulent offers and transactions are increasing at alarming rates.\n\n\u201cWhile e-commerce is delivering unprecedented product choice, convenience and price transparency, it also presents consumers with a number of new risks, such as identity theft and theft of credit card information. Fraudulent offers and transactions also are increasing at an alarming rate,\u201d said its minister Dato Sri Alexander Nanta Linggi.\n\nHe said this in his text of speech delivered during the 2021 Malaysia Economic and Strategic Outlook Forum in Putrajaya recently.\n\nAdditionally, e-commerce platforms are also increasingly vulnerable to a growing illicit industry distributing harmful, unsafe, substandard or faulty products \u2013 including counterfeit and pirated products, he added.\n\nAs much as 50 per cent of drugs sold through online pharmacies are counterfeits containing the wrong ingredients; random mixtures of noxious chemicals; insufficient, too much or no active ingredients; or fake packaging.\n\nIn Malaysia, there has been a total of 2,997 cases of counterfeit products reported from 2017 to 2020.\n\nCounterfeit items seized during operations included products such as food items, medicines, cosmetics electrical devices, clothing and luxury items, he added.\n\nThere has also been an increase of 112.5 per cent of online transactions complaints lodged at KPDNHEP in 2020, compared to 2019 (5,416 nos of complaints).\n\n\u201cThe upwards trend can be contributed to the change of purchasing methods \u2013 from the traditional brick-and-mortar purchases to the online platform purchases. This shows that majority of consumers in Malaysia have already adapted to the new norm of Covid-19 through their daily online transactions.\u201d\n\nNanta said these widespread online activities to target and deceive consumers present significant challenges for government and businesses to investigate and stop the flow of fake and unsafe goods.\n\n\u201cWith the prevalence of the Covid-19 pandemic, many have opted for online shopping as their primary shopping method to satisfy their buying needs while attempting to keep safe from the virus.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs more and more online retailers emerge in this ever-growing and ever-advancing market, the number of online shoppers has increased as well.\u201d\n\nAs a result, instances of online retailers taking advantage of their customers using unethical or even illegal advertising or marketing tactics to attract more customers has also increased as well, he said.\n\nHe said online retailers have many ways to increase their chances of profit-making by using pricing strategies such as \u2018yo-yo pricing\u2019 (which is increasing the price of their products when supply is low and then decreasing the price after the supply increases) and \u2018predatory pricing\u2019.\n\n\u201cPredatory pricing occurs when online businesses lower the price of their products below the manufacturing cost in hopes that it will drive their competitors out of business.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother strategy that is often deployed is when unscrupulous retailers mislead customers or consumers through \u2018fake\u2019 or misleading discounts, which many consumers are unaware of,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis was rumoured to have happened recently during the highly-anticipated yearly nationwide \u201811.11\u2019, Black Friday, and \u201912.12\u2019 sales.\u201d\n\nConsumers however can protect themselves when faced with misleading advertisements or representations by online businesses by filing a complaint with the e-commerce platforms directly.\n\nMany E-commerce platforms such as Shopee and Lazada have their own policies for dealing with misleading discounts, he said.\n\nFor example, Shopee prohibits price manipulation and fake discounts as they create a false impression of the product prices.

digital piracy and infringement of creative rights does not seem to be commensurate with the losses of up to RM3 billion that content providers have to endure.\n\nAccording to a joint statement by several major players in the creative industry, digital piracy has also robbed the government off some RM500 million in government taxes while putting thousands of jobs at risk.\n\nStar Media Group chief marketing officer Lam Swee Kim said the penalty being imposed should reflect how severe the act of piracy impacts the industry and the act of fuelling piracy in terms of monetisation or remuneration should also be monitored and penalised.\n\nThe authorities are also urged to take action against key enablers of digital piracy by blocking illegal streaming sites over the Internet and illicit streaming devices (ISDs) that are being openly sold on e-commerce platforms.\n\nMalaysian Film Producers Association honorary secretary Zahrin Aris said the penalty is too light and needs to be heavier.\n\n\u201cThe penalty for those who use media boxes loaded with unauthorised apps is too light. The penalty should be heavier. The value of content being pirated is definitely higher than the fine of only RM30,000,\u201d Zahrin said.\n\nEradicating digital piracy requires collaborative efforts by all parties from content providers, broadcasters, regulators, authorities and consumers to telecommunication companies, Internet service and e-commerce providers. Such effort would only allow responsible content to be streamed.\n\nOn Feb 8, 2021, an IT company was the first to be charged in court under Section 41(1)(ha) of the Copyright Act 1987 for selling technology or equipment for the purpose of the circumvention of technological protection measure referred to in subsection 36A(3) of the same Act.\n\nThe action was spearheaded by the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs deputy public prosecutor.\n\nThe company\u2019s director has pleaded guilty and is currently awaiting the court\u2019s sentence.\n\nIn the same month, a 46-year-old woman was charged with the possession of six media television boxes, allowing the illegal streaming of Astro\u2019s content via the Internet.\n\nThe accused was fined RM30,000 under Section 232(2) of the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998, making her the ISD seller to be charged under this provision.\n\nThe stern action is lauded by the local content industry as a great move to curb digital piracy that has been happening in the country for a while now.\n\nProducer and director Datuk Yusof Haslam said without the resolve and effort of relevant authorities, the crimes would not have been stopped.\n\n\u201cThis act of theft is not new and has to be resolved by the authorities. I regret to see empty rhetoric without a real solution to the problem. Without stricter regulations, piracy will continue to be cancer to the creative industry and its talents,\u201d he said.\n\nAstro regulatory director Laila Saat said the industry also welcomes the recent charges brought against sellers of ISD and will continue working with authorities in sending out the message.\n\n\u201cPiracy has become so pervasive that many have forgotten that it is theft and is the biggest scourge of the industry, stealing from every single person in the creative ecosystem from actors, writers, producers, directors and cameramen, thus hampering development.\n\n\u201cIf piracy is left unchecked, it will retard the entertainment industry as it doesn\u2019t make economic sense for anyone to create or invest in premium content,\u201d Laila said.", "keyword": ["authorities", "higher", "piracy", "act", "creative", "penalties", "needed", "streaming", "providers", "penalty", "industry", "content", "digital"], "summary": "According to a joint statement by several major players in the creative industry, digital piracy has also robbed the government off some RM500 million in government taxes while putting thousands of jobs at risk.\nThe authorities are also urged to take action against key enablers of digital piracy by blocking illegal streaming sites over the Internet and illicit streaming devices (ISDs) that are being openly sold on e-commerce platforms.\nEradicating digital piracy requires collaborative efforts by all parties from content providers, broadcasters, regulators, authorities and consumers to telecommunication companies, Internet service and e-commerce providers.\nThe stern action is lauded by the local content industry as a great move to curb digital piracy that has been happening in the country for a while now.\nWithout stricter regulations, piracy will continue to be cancer to the creative industry and its talents,\u201d he said.", "news": "The Malaysian Reserve", "date": "2021-02-24 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Old enough to die for country but too young to vote?", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wMi8xOC9vbGQtZW5vdWdoLXRvLWRpZS1mb3ItY291bnRyeS1idXQtdG9vLXlvdW5nLXRvLXZvdGUv0gEA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Minderjeet Kaur"], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Students-UTM-MJIIT-Parliament-111019-FMT.jpg", "text": "PETALING JAYA: Should 18-year-olds, who can legally drive and get married, be allowed to vote?\n\nThe law allowing 18-year-old Malaysians to vote and even stand as election candidates was passed and gazetted in 2019 but has yet to be implemented.\n\nWan Ahmad Fayhsal Wan Ahmad Kamal, the deputy minister of youth and sports, got an argument going when he said that youths were not mature enough to vote and needed to be educated before being allowed to do so.\n\nThe right to vote should come with the moral duty to do so judiciously, he said.\n\nTwo analysts FMT spoke to disagreed but another supported the deputy minister\u2019s opinion.\n\nKenneth Cheng of the Agora Society, a loose network of intellectuals, noted that 18-year-olds were considered old enough to join the army.\n\n\u201cIf they can die for their country, why question their knowledge?\u201d he said.\n\nCheng questioned the sensitivity of those saying youths need more education before voting, pointing out that reading materials on current issues as well as on the responsibilities of voters were freely available on the internet.\n\nMoreover, he said, it would be naive to imagine that all older people were well equipped intellectually to decide whom to vote for.\n\nHowever, Cheng also said most voters, whether literate or illiterate, were aware of the issues affecting their daily lives and the young in a maturing society should be even better at thinking for themselves.\n\nHe said schools were teaching about voting rights as part of the history syllabus and students could learn more through the internet.\n\nIt smacked of a discriminatory attitude to assume that students were not educated enough on voting rights and responsibilities, he added.\n\nAwang Azman Pawi of Universiti Malaya also referred to lessons on voting rights in the history syllabus and said that students were learning about ethics through moral and religious studies.\n\nMost countries, he said, allowed the young to vote and Malaysia should not backpedal into questioning the political literacy of the young.\n\nHe said politicians who were raising doubts about the voting knowledge of 18-year-olds could be doing so out of their fear of anti-establishment youths.\n\n\u201cBut youths do not care about a political party\u2019s ideology. For them it is about education, scholarships, training and jobs.\u201d\n\nAwang Azman also said youths wanted political parties to be free from corruption and might look for a third force if they were unhappy with ruling parties as well as with the established opposition.\n\n\u201cThese requirements may frighten some political parties,\u201d he said.\n\nFormer academic Azmi Hassan agrees with Wan Fayhsal, saying university students were lacking in the critical thinking needed to make decisions.\n\n\u201cWhen we ask them critical or general knowledge questions, they find it hard to answer because of a lack of knowledge.\n\n\u201cI am not sure if those aged 18 to 21 can make decisions based on knowledge or on just their whims and fancies,\u201d he said.\n\nHe urged the education ministry to introduce critical thinking and general knowledge courses from Primary One to tertiary-level.\n\nThe Undi 18 bill, officially known as Constitution (Amendment) Bill 2019, was passed by the Dewan Negara in July 2019 and gazetted two months later.\n\nOn Tuesday, Umno information chief Shahril Hamdan urged the government to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d and allow the voting age to be lowered to 18.\n\nHe said the government should be \u201cgentlemanly enough\u201d and not change its stance on the issue \u201cjust because young voters are not in favour of the ruling party\u201d.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["thinking", "students", "voters", "rights", "voting", "youths", "knowledge", "old", "country", "die", "political", "young", "vote"], "summary": "He said schools were teaching about voting rights as part of the history syllabus and students could learn more through the internet.\nIt smacked of a discriminatory attitude to assume that students were not educated enough on voting rights and responsibilities, he added.\nMost countries, he said, allowed the young to vote and Malaysia should not backpedal into questioning the political literacy of the young.\nHe said politicians who were raising doubts about the voting knowledge of 18-year-olds could be doing so out of their fear of anti-establishment youths.\nHe said the government should be \u201cgentlemanly enough\u201d and not change its stance on the issue \u201cjust because young voters are not in favour of the ruling party\u201d.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-02-18 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "MKN\u2019s Official MCO 2.0 SOP As Of 18 Feb (In English)", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wMi8xOS9ta25zLW9mZmljaWFsLW1jby0yLTAtc29wLWFzLW9mLTE4LWZlYi1pbi1lbmdsaXNoL9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wMi8xOS9ta25zLW9mZmljaWFsLW1jby0yLTAtc29wLWFzLW9mLTE4LWZlYi1pbi1lbmdsaXNoL2FtcC8?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Hamzah Nazari", "Maya Suraya", "Azizul Rahman Ismail"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mco-roadblock-feature-image.jpg", "text": "Subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates.\n\nFor your convenience, we\u2019ve translated to English the latest Movement Control Order (MCO) standard operating procedure (SOP) released by the National Security Council (MKN).

unprecedented product choice, convenience and price transparency, it also presents consumers with a number of new risks, such as identity theft and theft of credit card information. Fraudulent offers and transactions also are increasing at an alarming rate,\u201d said its minister Dato Sri Alexander Nanta Linggi.\n\nHe said this in his text of speech delivered during the 2021 Malaysia Economic and Strategic Outlook Forum in Putrajaya recently.\n\nAdditionally, e-commerce platforms are also increasingly vulnerable to a growing illicit industry distributing harmful, unsafe, substandard or faulty products \u2013 including counterfeit and pirated products, he added.\n\nAs much as 50 per cent of drugs sold through online pharmacies are counterfeits containing the wrong ingredients; random mixtures of noxious chemicals; insufficient, too much or no active ingredients; or fake packaging.\n\nIn Malaysia, there has been a total of 2,997 cases of counterfeit products reported from 2017 to 2020.\n\nCounterfeit items seized during operations included products such as food items, medicines, cosmetics electrical devices, clothing and luxury items, he added.\n\nThere has also been an increase of 112.5 per cent of online transactions complaints lodged at KPDNHEP in 2020, compared to 2019 (5,416 nos of complaints).\n\n\u201cThe upwards trend can be contributed to the change of purchasing methods \u2013 from the traditional brick-and-mortar purchases to the online platform purchases. This shows that majority of consumers in Malaysia have already adapted to the new norm of Covid-19 through their daily online transactions.\u201d\n\nNanta said these widespread online activities to target and deceive consumers present significant challenges for government and businesses to investigate and stop the flow of fake and unsafe goods.\n\n\u201cWith the prevalence of the Covid-19 pandemic, many have opted for online shopping as their primary shopping method to satisfy their buying needs while attempting to keep safe from the virus.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs more and more online retailers emerge in this ever-growing and ever-advancing market, the number of online shoppers has increased as well.\u201d\n\nAs a result, instances of online retailers taking advantage of their customers using unethical or even illegal advertising or marketing tactics to attract more customers has also increased as well, he said.\n\nHe said online retailers have many ways to increase their chances of profit-making by using pricing strategies such as \u2018yo-yo pricing\u2019 (which is increasing the price of their products when supply is low and then decreasing the price after the supply increases) and \u2018predatory pricing\u2019.\n\n\u201cPredatory pricing occurs when online businesses lower the price of their products below the manufacturing cost in hopes that it will drive their competitors out of business.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother strategy that is often deployed is when unscrupulous retailers mislead customers or consumers through \u2018fake\u2019 or misleading discounts, which many consumers are unaware of,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis was rumoured to have happened recently during the highly-anticipated yearly nationwide \u201811.11\u2019, Black Friday, and \u201912.12\u2019 sales.\u201d\n\nConsumers however can protect themselves when faced with misleading advertisements or representations by online businesses by filing a complaint with the e-commerce platforms directly.\n\nMany E-commerce platforms such as Shopee and Lazada have their own policies for dealing with misleading discounts, he said.\n\nFor example, Shopee prohibits price manipulation and fake discounts as they create a false impression of the product prices. Listings with misleading discounts will be suspended by Shopee for a first offence, with no penalty as a warning, he explained.\n\nHowever, he said, if there is any subsequent offence by the seller in the future, all listings found with the behaviour of misleading discounts will be deleted as it would be a \u2018Prohibited Listing\u2019.\n\nSimilarly, sellers on Lazada are not allowed to offer misleading discounts during the campaign period such as 11.11, 12.12 among others, he added.\n\nLazada may remove the products from listing if the sellers are found to be in breach of the policy, said Nanta.\n\nAggrieved consumers can also choose to lodge their complaints \u2013 either to the KPDNHEP Consumer Complaints Management Centre (or the PPAP) or the National Consumer Complaints Centre (NCCC) or the Ministry itself.\n\nPPAP is the official ministry\u2019s complaints channel and can be reached via the hotline 1-800-886-800, the e-Aduan system, e-mails, WhatsApp application and walk-in complainants.", "keyword": ["rise", "fraud", "misleading", "price", "complaints", "retailers", "kpdnhep", "theft", "cases", "consumers", "online", "discounts", "fake", "identity", "products"], "summary": "KUCHING (Feb 24): The Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumers Affairs (KPDNHEP) said cases of identity theft, theft of credit card information and fraudulent offers and transactions are increasing at alarming rates.\nMany E-commerce platforms such as Shopee and Lazada have their own policies for dealing with misleading discounts, he said.\nFor example, Shopee prohibits price manipulation and fake discounts as they create a false impression of the product prices.\nListings with misleading discounts will be suspended by Shopee for a first offence, with no penalty as a warning, he explained.\nSimilarly, sellers on Lazada are not allowed to offer misleading discounts during the campaign period such as 11.11, 12.12 among others, he added.", "news": "The Borneo Post", "date": "2021-02-24 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Complaints on online transactions rise 112.5%", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWFsYXlzaWFucmVzZXJ2ZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi8yMy9jb21wbGFpbnRzLW9uLW9ubGluZS10cmFuc2FjdGlvbnMtcmlzZS0xMTItNS_SAVxodHRwczovL3RoZW1hbGF5c2lhbnJlc2VydmUuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvMjMvY29tcGxhaW50cy1vbi1vbmxpbmUtdHJhbnNhY3Rpb25zLXJpc2UtMTEyLTUvYW1wLw?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://themalaysianreserve.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/19TR004A1-1.jpg", "text": "by LYDIA NATHAN / Pic by RAZAK GHAZALI\n\nTHE Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) has recorded an increase of 112.5% in complaints last year, compared to 5,416 complaints in 2019, vastly due to the shift from traditional brick-and-mortar purchases to online platforms.\n\nMinister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi (picture) said as online retailers are mushrooming, so have unethical or even illegal advertising and marketing tactics to attract more customers.\n\n\u201cThere are many ways to increase profit-making, like \u2018yo-yo pricing\u2019 \u2014 which is increasing prices when there is low supply, but decreasing it when supply is plenty,\u201d he said yesterday at 2021 Malaysia Economic and Strategic Outlook Forum entitled \u201cThe Post-Covid New Normal \u2014 Where Do We Go from Here\u201d.\n\nNanta Linggi said the complaints also included predatory pricing, or lowering prices below manufacturing costs in an aim to drive competitors out of business.\n\n\u201cAnother strategy often deployed is when retailers mislead consumers through fake discounts, which allegedly took place during the highly anticipated 11.11, Black Friday and 12.12 nationwide sales,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Nanta Linggi, even though e-commerce has proven to be convenient and the choice for most, it has also presented consumers with risks, including identity theft and credit card fraud.\n\n\u201cFraudulent offers and transactions are also increasing at alarming rates.

digital piracy and infringement of creative rights does not seem to be commensurate with the losses of up to RM3 billion that content providers have to endure.\n\nAccording to a joint statement by several major players in the creative industry, digital piracy has also robbed the government off some RM500 million in government taxes while putting thousands of jobs at risk.\n\nStar Media Group chief marketing officer Lam Swee Kim said the penalty being imposed should reflect how severe the act of piracy impacts the industry and the act of fuelling piracy in terms of monetisation or remuneration should also be monitored and penalised.\n\nThe authorities are also urged to take action against key enablers of digital piracy by blocking illegal streaming sites over the Internet and illicit streaming devices (ISDs) that are being openly sold on e-commerce platforms.\n\nMalaysian Film Producers Association honorary secretary Zahrin Aris said the penalty is too light and needs to be heavier.\n\n\u201cThe penalty for those who use media boxes loaded with unauthorised apps is too light. The penalty should be heavier. The value of content being pirated is definitely higher than the fine of only RM30,000,\u201d Zahrin said.\n\nEradicating digital piracy requires collaborative efforts by all parties from content providers, broadcasters, regulators, authorities and consumers to telecommunication companies, Internet service and e-commerce providers.

For them it is about education, scholarships, training and jobs.\u201d\n\nAwang Azman also said youths wanted political parties to be free from corruption and might look for a third force if they were unhappy with ruling parties as well as with the established opposition.\n\n\u201cThese requirements may frighten some political parties,\u201d he said.\n\nFormer academic Azmi Hassan agrees with Wan Fayhsal, saying university students were lacking in the critical thinking needed to make decisions.\n\n\u201cWhen we ask them critical or general knowledge questions, they find it hard to answer because of a lack of knowledge.\n\n\u201cI am not sure if those aged 18 to 21 can make decisions based on knowledge or on just their whims and fancies,\u201d he said.\n\nHe urged the education ministry to introduce critical thinking and general knowledge courses from Primary One to tertiary-level.\n\nThe Undi 18 bill, officially known as Constitution (Amendment) Bill 2019, was passed by the Dewan Negara in July 2019 and gazetted two months later.\n\nOn Tuesday, Umno information chief Shahril Hamdan urged the government to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d and allow the voting age to be lowered to 18.\n\nHe said the government should be \u201cgentlemanly enough\u201d and not change its stance on the issue \u201cjust because young voters are not in favour of the ruling party\u201d.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["thinking", "students", "voters", "rights", "voting", "youths", "knowledge", "old", "country", "die", "political", "young", "vote"], "summary": "He said schools were teaching about voting rights as part of the history syllabus and students could learn more through the internet.\nIt smacked of a discriminatory attitude to assume that students were not educated enough on voting rights and responsibilities, he added.\nMost countries, he said, allowed the young to vote and Malaysia should not backpedal into questioning the political literacy of the young.\nHe said politicians who were raising doubts about the voting knowledge of 18-year-olds could be doing so out of their fear of anti-establishment youths.\nHe said the government should be \u201cgentlemanly enough\u201d and not change its stance on the issue \u201cjust because young voters are not in favour of the ruling party\u201d.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-02-18 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "MKN\u2019s Official MCO 2.0 SOP As Of 18 Feb (In English)", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wMi8xOS9ta25zLW9mZmljaWFsLW1jby0yLTAtc29wLWFzLW9mLTE4LWZlYi1pbi1lbmdsaXNoL9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wMi8xOS9ta25zLW9mZmljaWFsLW1jby0yLTAtc29wLWFzLW9mLTE4LWZlYi1pbi1lbmdsaXNoL2FtcC8?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Hamzah Nazari", "Maya Suraya", "Azizul Rahman Ismail"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mco-roadblock-feature-image.jpg", "text": "Subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates.\n\nFor your convenience, we\u2019ve translated to English the latest Movement Control Order (MCO) standard operating procedure (SOP) released by the National Security Council (MKN).

little went Juventus\u2019s way, Federico Chiesa\u2019s late strike at least handed them a lifeline going into the return leg in Turin on March 9.\n\nTaremi pounced on a sloppy back pass after 63 seconds to fire in the opener that left Juventus rattled as they failed to create any meaningful chances before halftime.\n\nThings got worse for Andrea Pirlo\u2019s side when Marega blasted in Porto\u2019s second 19 seconds into the second half.\n\nJuventus eventually mustered a response when Chiesa fired home a precious away goal with eight minutes remaining, but it was not enough to stop the 2004 champions from celebrating their first victory over the Italian club at the sixth attempt.\n\nThe winger\u2019s strike ended Porto\u2019s run of five consecutive clean sheets in the competition and leaves the tie wide open ahead of the return leg.\n\nJuve impressed in the group stage by winning five games from six, including a 3-0 final day victory at Barcelona.\n\nBut they got off to the worst start possible when Taremi anticipated Rodrigo Bentancur\u2019s pass back to Wojciech Szczesny and slid in to shoot past the goalkeeper from close range.\n\nJuve were visibly knocked off their stride by the aggression of Porto\u2019s pressing and were almost caught out again when Szczesny cleared the ball straight to Sergio Oliveira, whose shot was deflected wide.\n\nMatters were made worse for the Turin club when captain Giorgio Chiellini limped off with injury after 34 minutes.\n\nPorto were even quicker out of the blocks in the second half as Marega got on the end of a Wilson Manafa cutback to fire home within seconds of the restart.\n\nSzczesny stuck out a hand to stop an Oliveira shot from making it three, but the visitors finally came to life in the final 20 minutes.\n\nAgustin Marchesin had to scramble to palm away a deflected Chiesa shot, before the Italy international raced onto a pass to cushion a finish into the corner.\n\nThe goal made Chiesa the first Juventus player other than Cristiano Ronaldo to score a knockout stage goal in the Champions League since Blaise Matuidi in April 2018.\n\nRonaldo, the competition\u2019s all-time top scorer,

Affairs (KPDNHEP) said cases of identity theft, theft of credit card information and fraudulent offers and transactions are increasing at alarming rates.\n\n\u201cWhile e-commerce is delivering unprecedented product choice, convenience and price transparency, it also presents consumers with a number of new risks, such as identity theft and theft of credit card information. Fraudulent offers and transactions also are increasing at an alarming rate,\u201d said its minister Dato Sri Alexander Nanta Linggi.\n\nHe said this in his text of speech delivered during the 2021 Malaysia Economic and Strategic Outlook Forum in Putrajaya recently.\n\nAdditionally, e-commerce platforms are also increasingly vulnerable to a growing illicit industry distributing harmful, unsafe, substandard or faulty products \u2013 including counterfeit and pirated products, he added.\n\nAs much as 50 per cent of drugs sold through online pharmacies are counterfeits containing the wrong ingredients; random mixtures of noxious chemicals; insufficient, too much or no active ingredients; or fake packaging.\n\nIn Malaysia, there has been a total of 2,997 cases of counterfeit products reported from 2017 to 2020.\n\nCounterfeit items seized during operations included products such as food items, medicines, cosmetics electrical devices, clothing and luxury items, he added.\n\nThere has also been an increase of 112.5 per cent of online transactions complaints lodged at KPDNHEP in 2020, compared to 2019 (5,416 nos of complaints).\n\n\u201cThe upwards trend can be contributed to the change of purchasing methods \u2013 from the traditional brick-and-mortar purchases to the online platform purchases. This shows that majority of consumers in Malaysia have already adapted to the new norm of Covid-19 through their daily online transactions.\u201d\n\nNanta said these widespread online activities to target and deceive consumers present significant challenges for government and businesses to investigate and stop the flow of fake and unsafe goods.\n\n\u201cWith the prevalence of the Covid-19 pandemic, many have opted for online shopping as their primary shopping method to satisfy their buying needs while attempting to keep safe from the virus.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs more and more online retailers emerge in this ever-growing and ever-advancing market, the number of online shoppers has increased as well.\u201d\n\nAs a result, instances of online retailers taking advantage of their customers using unethical or even illegal advertising or marketing tactics to attract more customers has also increased as well, he said.\n\nHe said online retailers have many ways to increase their chances of profit-making by using pricing strategies such as \u2018yo-yo pricing\u2019 (which is increasing the price of their products when supply is low and then decreasing the price after the supply increases) and \u2018predatory pricing\u2019.\n\n\u201cPredatory pricing occurs when online businesses lower the price of their products below the manufacturing cost in hopes that it will drive their competitors out of business.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother strategy that is often deployed is when unscrupulous retailers mislead customers or consumers through \u2018fake\u2019 or misleading discounts, which many consumers are unaware of,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis was rumoured to have happened recently during the highly-anticipated yearly nationwide \u201811.11\u2019, Black Friday, and \u201912.12\u2019 sales.\u201d\n\nConsumers however can protect themselves when faced with misleading advertisements or representations by online businesses by filing a complaint with the e-commerce platforms directly.\n\nMany E-commerce platforms such as Shopee and Lazada have their own policies for dealing with misleading discounts, he said.\n\nFor example, Shopee prohibits price manipulation and fake discounts as they create a false impression of the product prices. Listings with misleading discounts will be suspended by Shopee for a first offence, with no penalty as a warning, he explained.\n\nHowever, he said, if there is any subsequent offence by the seller in the future, all listings found with the behaviour of misleading discounts will be deleted as it would be a \u2018Prohibited Listing\u2019.\n\nSimilarly, sellers on Lazada are not allowed to offer misleading discounts during the campaign period such as 11.11, 12.12 among others, he added.\n\nLazada may remove the products from listing if the sellers are found to be in breach of the policy, said Nanta.\n\nAggrieved consumers can also choose to lodge their complaints \u2013 either to the KPDNHEP Consumer Complaints Management Centre (or the PPAP) or the National Consumer Complaints Centre (NCCC) or the Ministry itself.\n\nPPAP is the official ministry\u2019s complaints channel and can be reached via the hotline 1-800-886-800, the e-Aduan system, e-mails, WhatsApp application and walk-in complainants.", "keyword": ["rise", "fraud", "misleading", "price", "complaints", "retailers", "kpdnhep", "theft", "cases", "consumers", "online", "discounts", "fake", "identity", "products"], "summary": "KUCHING (Feb 24): The Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumers Affairs (KPDNHEP) said cases of identity theft, theft of credit card information and fraudulent offers and transactions are increasing at alarming rates.\nMany E-commerce platforms such as Shopee and Lazada have their own policies for dealing with misleading discounts, he said.\nFor example, Shopee prohibits price manipulation and fake discounts as they create a false impression of the product prices.\nListings with misleading discounts will be suspended by Shopee for a first offence, with no penalty as a warning, he explained.\nSimilarly, sellers on Lazada are not allowed to offer misleading discounts during the campaign period such as 11.11, 12.12 among others, he added.", "news": "The Borneo Post", "date": "2021-02-24 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Complaints on online transactions rise 112.5%", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWFsYXlzaWFucmVzZXJ2ZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi8yMy9jb21wbGFpbnRzLW9uLW9ubGluZS10cmFuc2FjdGlvbnMtcmlzZS0xMTItNS_SAVxodHRwczovL3RoZW1hbGF5c2lhbnJlc2VydmUuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvMjMvY29tcGxhaW50cy1vbi1vbmxpbmUtdHJhbnNhY3Rpb25zLXJpc2UtMTEyLTUvYW1wLw?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://themalaysianreserve.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/19TR004A1-1.jpg", "text": "by LYDIA NATHAN / Pic by RAZAK GHAZALI\n\nTHE Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) has recorded an increase of 112.5% in complaints last year, compared to 5,416 complaints in 2019, vastly due to the shift from traditional brick-and-mortar purchases to online platforms.\n\nMinister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi (picture) said as online retailers are mushrooming, so have unethical or even illegal advertising and marketing tactics to attract more customers.\n\n\u201cThere are many ways to increase profit-making, like \u2018yo-yo pricing\u2019 \u2014 which is increasing prices when there is low supply, but decreasing it when supply is plenty,\u201d he said yesterday at 2021 Malaysia Economic and Strategic Outlook Forum entitled \u201cThe Post-Covid New Normal \u2014 Where Do We Go from Here\u201d.\n\nNanta Linggi said the complaints also included predatory pricing, or lowering prices below manufacturing costs in an aim to drive competitors out of business.\n\n\u201cAnother strategy often deployed is when retailers mislead consumers through fake discounts, which allegedly took place during the highly anticipated 11.11, Black Friday and 12.12 nationwide sales,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Nanta Linggi, even though e-commerce has proven to be convenient and the choice for most, it has also presented consumers with risks, including identity theft and credit card fraud.\n\n\u201cFraudulent offers and transactions are also increasing at alarming rates.

several major players in the creative industry, digital piracy has also robbed the government off some RM500 million in government taxes while putting thousands of jobs at risk.\n\nStar Media Group chief marketing officer Lam Swee Kim said the penalty being imposed should reflect how severe the act of piracy impacts the industry and the act of fuelling piracy in terms of monetisation or remuneration should also be monitored and penalised.\n\nThe authorities are also urged to take action against key enablers of digital piracy by blocking illegal streaming sites over the Internet and

The penalty should be heavier. The value of content being pirated is definitely higher than the fine of only RM30,000,\u201d Zahrin said.\n\nEradicating digital piracy requires collaborative efforts by all parties from content providers, broadcasters, regulators, authorities and consumers to telecommunication companies, Internet service and e-commerce providers.

Affairs (KPDNHEP) said cases of identity theft, theft of credit card information and fraudulent offers and transactions are increasing at alarming rates.\n\n\u201cWhile e-commerce is delivering unprecedented product choice, convenience and price transparency, it also presents consumers with a number of new risks, such as identity theft and theft of credit card information. Fraudulent offers and transactions also are increasing at an alarming rate,\u201d said its minister Dato Sri Alexander Nanta Linggi.\n\nHe said this in his text of speech delivered during the 2021 Malaysia Economic and Strategic Outlook Forum in Putrajaya recently.\n\nAdditionally, e-commerce platforms are also increasingly vulnerable to a growing illicit industry distributing harmful, unsafe, substandard or faulty products \u2013 including counterfeit and pirated products, he added.\n\nAs much as 50 per cent of drugs sold through online pharmacies are counterfeits containing the wrong ingredients; random mixtures of noxious chemicals; insufficient, too much or no active ingredients; or fake packaging.\n\nIn Malaysia, there has been a total of 2,997 cases of counterfeit products reported from 2017 to 2020.\n\nCounterfeit items seized during operations included products such as food items, medicines, cosmetics electrical devices, clothing and luxury items, he added.\n\nThere has also been an increase of 112.5 per cent of online transactions complaints lodged at KPDNHEP in 2020, compared to 2019 (5,416 nos of complaints).\n\n\u201cThe upwards trend can be contributed to the change of purchasing methods \u2013 from the traditional brick-and-mortar purchases to the online platform purchases. This shows that majority of consumers in Malaysia have already adapted to the new norm of Covid-19 through their daily online transactions.\u201d\n\nNanta said these widespread online activities to target and deceive consumers present significant challenges for government and businesses to investigate and stop the flow of fake and unsafe goods.\n\n\u201cWith the prevalence of the Covid-19 pandemic, many have opted for online shopping as their primary shopping method to satisfy their buying needs while attempting to keep safe from the virus.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs more and more online retailers emerge in this ever-growing and ever-advancing market, the number of online shoppers has increased as well.\u201d\n\nAs a result, instances of online retailers taking advantage of their customers using unethical or even illegal advertising or marketing tactics to attract more customers has also increased as well, he said.\n\nHe said online retailers have many ways to increase their chances of profit-making by using pricing strategies such as \u2018yo-yo pricing\u2019 (which is increasing the price of their products when supply is low and then decreasing the price after the supply increases) and \u2018predatory pricing\u2019.\n\n\u201cPredatory pricing occurs when online businesses lower the price of their products below the manufacturing cost in hopes that it will drive their competitors out of business.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother strategy that is often deployed is when unscrupulous retailers mislead customers or consumers through \u2018fake\u2019 or misleading discounts, which many consumers are unaware of,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis was rumoured to have happened recently during the highly-anticipated yearly nationwide \u201811.11\u2019, Black Friday, and \u201912.12\u2019 sales.\u201d\n\nConsumers however can protect themselves when faced with misleading advertisements or representations by online businesses by filing a complaint with the e-commerce platforms directly.\n\nMany E-commerce platforms such as Shopee and Lazada have their own policies for dealing with misleading discounts, he said.\n\nFor example, Shopee prohibits price manipulation and fake discounts as they create a false impression of the product prices.

digital piracy and infringement of creative rights does not seem to be commensurate with the losses of up to RM3 billion that content providers have to endure.\n\nAccording to a joint statement by several major players in the creative industry, digital piracy has also robbed the government off some RM500 million in government taxes while putting thousands of jobs at risk.\n\nStar Media Group chief marketing officer Lam Swee Kim said the penalty being imposed should reflect how severe the act of piracy impacts the industry and the act of fuelling piracy in terms of monetisation or remuneration should also be monitored and penalised.\n\nThe authorities are also urged to take action against key enablers of digital piracy by blocking illegal streaming sites over the Internet and illicit streaming devices (ISDs) that are being openly sold on e-commerce platforms.\n\nMalaysian Film Producers Association honorary secretary Zahrin Aris said the penalty is too light and needs to be heavier.\n\n\u201cThe penalty for those who use media boxes loaded with unauthorised apps is too light. The penalty should be heavier. The value of content being pirated is definitely higher than the fine of only RM30,000,\u201d Zahrin said.\n\nEradicating digital piracy requires collaborative efforts by all parties from content providers, broadcasters, regulators, authorities and consumers to telecommunication companies, Internet service and e-commerce providers. Such effort would only allow responsible content to be streamed.\n\nOn Feb 8, 2021, an IT company was the first to be charged in court under Section 41(1)(ha) of the Copyright Act 1987 for selling technology or equipment for the purpose of the circumvention of technological protection measure referred to in subsection 36A(3) of the same Act.\n\nThe action was spearheaded by the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs deputy public prosecutor.\n\nThe company\u2019s director has pleaded guilty and is currently awaiting the court\u2019s sentence.\n\nIn the same month, a 46-year-old woman was charged with the possession of six media television boxes, allowing the illegal streaming of Astro\u2019s content via the Internet.\n\nThe accused was fined RM30,000 under Section 232(2) of the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998, making her the ISD seller to be charged under this provision.\n\nThe stern action is lauded by the local content industry as a great move to curb digital piracy that has been happening in the country for a while now.\n\nProducer and director Datuk Yusof Haslam said without the resolve and effort of relevant authorities, the crimes would not have been stopped.\n\n\u201cThis act of theft is not new and has to be resolved by the authorities. I regret to see empty rhetoric without a real solution to the problem. Without stricter regulations, piracy will continue to be cancer to the creative industry and its talents,\u201d he said.\n\nAstro regulatory director Laila Saat said the industry also welcomes the recent charges brought against sellers of ISD and will continue working with authorities in sending out the message.\n\n\u201cPiracy has become so pervasive that many have forgotten that it is theft and is the biggest scourge of the industry, stealing from every single person in the creative ecosystem from actors, writers, producers, directors and cameramen, thus hampering development.\n\n\u201cIf piracy is left unchecked, it will retard the entertainment industry as it doesn\u2019t make economic sense for anyone to create or invest in premium content,\u201d Laila said.", "keyword": ["authorities", "higher", "piracy", "act", "creative", "penalties", "needed", "streaming", "providers", "penalty", "industry", "content", "digital"], "summary": "According to a joint statement by several major players in the creative industry, digital piracy has also robbed the government off some RM500 million in government taxes while putting thousands of jobs at risk.\nThe authorities are also urged to take action against key enablers of digital piracy by blocking illegal streaming sites over the Internet and illicit streaming devices (ISDs) that are being openly sold on e-commerce platforms.\nEradicating digital piracy requires collaborative efforts by all parties from content providers, broadcasters, regulators, authorities and consumers to telecommunication companies, Internet service and e-commerce providers.\nThe stern action is lauded by the local content industry as a great move to curb digital piracy that has been happening in the country for a while now.\nWithout stricter regulations, piracy will continue to be cancer to the creative industry and its talents,\u201d he said.", "news": "The Malaysian Reserve", "date": "2021-02-24 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Old enough to die for country but too young to vote?", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wMi8xOC9vbGQtZW5vdWdoLXRvLWRpZS1mb3ItY291bnRyeS1idXQtdG9vLXlvdW5nLXRvLXZvdGUv0gEA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Minderjeet Kaur"], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Students-UTM-MJIIT-Parliament-111019-FMT.jpg", "text": "PETALING JAYA: Should 18-year-olds, who can legally drive and get married, be allowed to vote?\n\nThe law allowing 18-year-old Malaysians to vote and even stand as election candidates was passed and gazetted in 2019 but has yet to be implemented.\n\nWan Ahmad Fayhsal Wan Ahmad Kamal, the deputy minister of youth and sports, got an argument going when he said that youths were not mature enough to vote and needed to be educated before being allowed to do so.\n\nThe right to vote should come with the moral duty to do so judiciously, he said.\n\nTwo analysts FMT spoke to disagreed but another supported the deputy minister\u2019s opinion.\n\nKenneth Cheng of the Agora Society, a loose network of intellectuals, noted that 18-year-olds were considered old enough to join the army.\n\n\u201cIf they can die for their country, why question their knowledge?\u201d he said.\n\nCheng questioned the sensitivity of those saying youths need more education before voting, pointing out that reading materials on current issues as well as on the responsibilities of voters were freely available on the internet.\n\nMoreover, he said, it would be naive to imagine that all older people were well equipped intellectually to decide whom to vote for.\n\nHowever, Cheng also said most voters, whether literate or illiterate, were aware of the issues affecting their daily lives and the young in a maturing society should be even better at thinking for themselves.\n\nHe said schools were teaching about voting rights as part of the history syllabus and students could learn more through the internet.\n\nIt smacked of a discriminatory attitude to assume that students were not educated enough on voting rights and responsibilities, he added.\n\nAwang Azman Pawi of Universiti Malaya also referred to lessons on voting rights in the history syllabus and said that students were learning about ethics through moral and religious studies.\n\nMost countries, he said, allowed the young to vote and Malaysia should not backpedal into questioning the political literacy of the young.\n\nHe said politicians who were raising doubts about the voting knowledge of 18-year-olds could be doing so out of their fear of anti-establishment youths.\n\n\u201cBut youths do not care about a political party\u2019s ideology. For them it is about education, scholarships, training and jobs.\u201d\n\nAwang Azman also said youths wanted political parties to be free from corruption and might look for a third force if they were unhappy with ruling parties as well as with the established opposition.\n\n\u201cThese requirements may frighten some political parties,\u201d he said.\n\nFormer academic Azmi Hassan agrees with Wan Fayhsal, saying university students were lacking in the critical thinking needed to make decisions.\n\n\u201cWhen we ask them critical or general knowledge questions, they find it hard to answer because of a lack of knowledge.\n\n\u201cI am not sure if those aged 18 to 21 can make decisions based on knowledge or on just their whims and fancies,\u201d he said.\n\nHe urged the education ministry to introduce critical thinking and general knowledge courses from Primary One to tertiary-level.\n\nThe Undi 18 bill, officially known as Constitution (Amendment) Bill 2019, was passed by the Dewan Negara in July 2019 and gazetted two months later.\n\nOn Tuesday, Umno information chief Shahril Hamdan urged the government to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d and allow the voting age to be lowered to 18.\n\nHe said the government should be \u201cgentlemanly enough\u201d and not change its stance on the issue \u201cjust because young voters are not in favour of the ruling party\u201d.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["thinking", "students", "voters", "rights", "voting", "youths", "knowledge", "old", "country", "die", "political", "young", "vote"], "summary": "He said schools were teaching about voting rights as part of the history syllabus and students could learn more through the internet.\nIt smacked of a discriminatory attitude to assume that students were not educated enough on voting rights and responsibilities, he added.\nMost countries, he said, allowed the young to vote and Malaysia should not backpedal into questioning the political literacy of the young.\nHe said politicians who were raising doubts about the voting knowledge of 18-year-olds could be doing so out of their fear of anti-establishment youths.\nHe said the government should be \u201cgentlemanly enough\u201d and not change its stance on the issue \u201cjust because young voters are not in favour of the ruling party\u201d.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-02-18 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "MKN\u2019s Official MCO 2.0 SOP As Of 18 Feb (In English)", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wMi8xOS9ta25zLW9mZmljaWFsLW1jby0yLTAtc29wLWFzLW9mLTE4LWZlYi1pbi1lbmdsaXNoL9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wMi8xOS9ta25zLW9mZmljaWFsLW1jby0yLTAtc29wLWFzLW9mLTE4LWZlYi1pbi1lbmdsaXNoL2FtcC8?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Hamzah Nazari", "Maya Suraya", "Azizul Rahman Ismail"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mco-roadblock-feature-image.jpg", "text": "Subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates.\n\nFor your convenience, we\u2019ve translated to English the latest Movement Control Order (MCO) standard operating procedure (SOP) released by the National Security Council (MKN).

unprecedented product choice, convenience and price transparency, it also presents consumers with a number of new risks, such as identity theft and theft of credit card information. Fraudulent offers and transactions also are increasing at an alarming rate,\u201d said its minister Dato Sri Alexander Nanta Linggi.\n\nHe said this in his text of speech delivered during the 2021 Malaysia Economic and Strategic Outlook Forum in Putrajaya recently.\n\nAdditionally, e-commerce platforms are also increasingly vulnerable to a growing illicit industry distributing harmful, unsafe, substandard or faulty products \u2013 including counterfeit and pirated products, he added.\n\nAs much as 50 per cent of drugs sold through online pharmacies are counterfeits containing the wrong ingredients; random mixtures of noxious chemicals; insufficient, too much or no active ingredients; or fake packaging.\n\nIn Malaysia, there has been a total of 2,997 cases of counterfeit products reported from 2017 to 2020.\n\nCounterfeit items seized during operations included products such as food items, medicines, cosmetics electrical devices, clothing and luxury items, he added.\n\nThere has also been an increase of 112.5 per cent of online transactions complaints lodged at KPDNHEP in 2020, compared to 2019 (5,416 nos of complaints).\n\n\u201cThe upwards trend can be contributed to the change of purchasing methods \u2013 from the traditional brick-and-mortar purchases to the online platform purchases. This shows that majority of consumers in Malaysia have already adapted to the new norm of Covid-19 through their daily online transactions.\u201d\n\nNanta said these widespread online activities to target and deceive consumers present significant challenges for government and businesses to investigate and stop the flow of fake and unsafe goods.\n\n\u201cWith the prevalence of the Covid-19 pandemic, many have opted for online shopping as their primary shopping method to satisfy their buying needs while attempting to keep safe from the virus.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs more and more online retailers emerge in this ever-growing and ever-advancing market, the number of online shoppers has increased as well.\u201d\n\nAs a result, instances of online retailers taking advantage of their customers using unethical or even illegal advertising or marketing tactics to attract more customers has also increased as well, he said.\n\nHe said online retailers have many ways to increase their chances of profit-making by using pricing strategies such as \u2018yo-yo pricing\u2019 (which is increasing the price of their products when supply is low and then decreasing the price after the supply increases) and \u2018predatory pricing\u2019.\n\n\u201cPredatory pricing occurs when online businesses lower the price of their products below the manufacturing cost in hopes that it will drive their competitors out of business.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother strategy that is often deployed is when unscrupulous retailers mislead customers or consumers through \u2018fake\u2019 or misleading discounts, which many consumers are unaware of,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis was rumoured to have happened recently during the highly-anticipated yearly nationwide \u201811.11\u2019, Black Friday, and \u201912.12\u2019 sales.\u201d\n\nConsumers however can protect themselves when faced with misleading advertisements or representations by online businesses by filing a complaint with the e-commerce platforms directly.\n\nMany E-commerce platforms such as Shopee and Lazada have their own policies for dealing with misleading discounts, he said.\n\nFor example, Shopee prohibits price manipulation and fake discounts as they create a false impression of the product prices. Listings with misleading discounts will be suspended by Shopee for a first offence, with no penalty as a warning, he explained.\n\nHowever, he said, if there is any subsequent offence by the seller in the future, all listings found with the behaviour of misleading discounts will be deleted as it would be a \u2018Prohibited Listing\u2019.\n\nSimilarly, sellers on Lazada are not allowed to offer misleading discounts during the campaign period such as 11.11, 12.12 among others, he added.\n\nLazada may remove the products from listing if the sellers are found to be in breach of the policy, said Nanta.\n\nAggrieved consumers can also choose to lodge their complaints \u2013 either to the KPDNHEP Consumer Complaints Management Centre (or the PPAP) or the National Consumer Complaints Centre (NCCC) or the Ministry itself.\n\nPPAP is the official ministry\u2019s complaints channel and can be reached via the hotline 1-800-886-800, the e-Aduan system, e-mails, WhatsApp application and walk-in complainants.", "keyword": ["rise", "fraud", "misleading", "price", "complaints", "retailers", "kpdnhep", "theft", "cases", "consumers", "online", "discounts", "fake", "identity", "products"], "summary": "KUCHING (Feb 24): The Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumers Affairs (KPDNHEP) said cases of identity theft, theft of credit card information and fraudulent offers and transactions are increasing at alarming rates.\nMany E-commerce platforms such as Shopee and Lazada have their own policies for dealing with misleading discounts, he said.\nFor example, Shopee prohibits price manipulation and fake discounts as they create a false impression of the product prices.\nListings with misleading discounts will be suspended by Shopee for a first offence, with no penalty as a warning, he explained.\nSimilarly, sellers on Lazada are not allowed to offer misleading discounts during the campaign period such as 11.11, 12.12 among others, he added.", "news": "The Borneo Post", "date": "2021-02-24 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Complaints on online transactions rise 112.5%", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWFsYXlzaWFucmVzZXJ2ZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi8yMy9jb21wbGFpbnRzLW9uLW9ubGluZS10cmFuc2FjdGlvbnMtcmlzZS0xMTItNS_SAVxodHRwczovL3RoZW1hbGF5c2lhbnJlc2VydmUuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvMjMvY29tcGxhaW50cy1vbi1vbmxpbmUtdHJhbnNhY3Rpb25zLXJpc2UtMTEyLTUvYW1wLw?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://themalaysianreserve.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/19TR004A1-1.jpg", "text": "by LYDIA NATHAN / Pic by RAZAK GHAZALI\n\nTHE Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) has recorded an increase of 112.5% in complaints last year, compared to 5,416 complaints in 2019, vastly due to the shift from traditional brick-and-mortar purchases to online platforms.\n\nMinister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi (picture) said as online retailers are mushrooming, so have unethical or even illegal advertising and marketing tactics to attract more customers.\n\n\u201cThere are many ways to increase profit-making, like \u2018yo-yo pricing\u2019 \u2014 which is increasing prices when there is low supply, but decreasing it when supply is plenty,\u201d he said yesterday at 2021 Malaysia Economic and Strategic Outlook Forum entitled \u201cThe Post-Covid New Normal \u2014 Where Do We Go from Here\u201d.\n\nNanta Linggi said the complaints also included predatory pricing, or lowering prices below manufacturing costs in an aim to drive competitors out of business.\n\n\u201cAnother strategy often deployed is when retailers mislead consumers through fake discounts, which allegedly took place during the highly anticipated 11.11, Black Friday and 12.12 nationwide sales,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Nanta Linggi, even though e-commerce has proven to be convenient and the choice for most, it has also presented consumers with risks, including identity theft and credit card fraud.\n\n\u201cFraudulent offers and transactions are also increasing at alarming rates.

digital piracy and infringement of creative rights does not seem to be commensurate with the losses of up to RM3 billion that content providers have to endure.\n\nAccording to a joint statement by several major players in the creative industry, digital piracy has also robbed the government off some RM500 million in government taxes while putting thousands of jobs at risk.\n\nStar Media Group chief marketing officer Lam Swee Kim said the penalty being imposed should reflect how severe the act of piracy impacts the industry and the act of fuelling piracy in terms of monetisation or remuneration should also be monitored and penalised.\n\nThe authorities are also urged to take action against key enablers of digital piracy by blocking illegal streaming sites over the Internet and illicit streaming devices (ISDs) that are being openly sold on e-commerce platforms.\n\nMalaysian Film Producers Association honorary secretary Zahrin Aris said the penalty is too light and needs to be heavier.\n\n\u201cThe penalty for those who use media boxes loaded with unauthorised apps is too light. The penalty should be heavier. The value of content being pirated is definitely higher than the fine of only RM30,000,\u201d Zahrin said.\n\nEradicating digital piracy requires collaborative efforts by all parties from content providers, broadcasters, regulators, authorities and consumers to telecommunication companies, Internet service and e-commerce providers.

For them it is about education, scholarships, training and jobs.\u201d\n\nAwang Azman also said youths wanted political parties to be free from corruption and might look for a third force if they were unhappy with ruling parties as well as with the established opposition.\n\n\u201cThese requirements may frighten some political parties,\u201d he said.\n\nFormer academic Azmi Hassan agrees with Wan Fayhsal, saying university students were lacking in the critical thinking needed to make decisions.\n\n\u201cWhen we ask them critical or general knowledge questions, they find it hard to answer because of a lack of knowledge.\n\n\u201cI am not sure if those aged 18 to 21 can make decisions based on knowledge or on just their whims and fancies,\u201d he said.\n\nHe urged the education ministry to introduce critical thinking and general knowledge courses from Primary One to tertiary-level.\n\nThe Undi 18 bill, officially known as Constitution (Amendment) Bill 2019, was passed by the Dewan Negara in July 2019 and gazetted two months later.\n\nOn Tuesday, Umno information chief Shahril Hamdan urged the government to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d and allow the voting age to be lowered to 18.\n\nHe said the government should be \u201cgentlemanly enough\u201d and not change its stance on the issue \u201cjust because young voters are not in favour of the ruling party\u201d.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["thinking", "students", "voters", "rights", "voting", "youths", "knowledge", "old", "country", "die", "political", "young", "vote"], "summary": "He said schools were teaching about voting rights as part of the history syllabus and students could learn more through the internet.\nIt smacked of a discriminatory attitude to assume that students were not educated enough on voting rights and responsibilities, he added.\nMost countries, he said, allowed the young to vote and Malaysia should not backpedal into questioning the political literacy of the young.\nHe said politicians who were raising doubts about the voting knowledge of 18-year-olds could be doing so out of their fear of anti-establishment youths.\nHe said the government should be \u201cgentlemanly enough\u201d and not change its stance on the issue \u201cjust because young voters are not in favour of the ruling party\u201d.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-02-18 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "MKN\u2019s Official MCO 2.0 SOP As Of 18 Feb (In English)", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wMi8xOS9ta25zLW9mZmljaWFsLW1jby0yLTAtc29wLWFzLW9mLTE4LWZlYi1pbi1lbmdsaXNoL9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wMi8xOS9ta25zLW9mZmljaWFsLW1jby0yLTAtc29wLWFzLW9mLTE4LWZlYi1pbi1lbmdsaXNoL2FtcC8?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Hamzah Nazari", "Maya Suraya", "Azizul Rahman Ismail"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mco-roadblock-feature-image.jpg", "text": "Subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates.\n\nFor your convenience, we\u2019ve translated to English the latest Movement Control Order (MCO) standard operating procedure (SOP) released by the National Security Council (MKN).

little went Juventus\u2019s way, Federico Chiesa\u2019s late strike at least handed them a lifeline going into the return leg in Turin on March 9.\n\nTaremi pounced on a sloppy back pass after 63 seconds to fire in the opener that left Juventus rattled as they failed to create any meaningful chances before halftime.\n\nThings got worse for Andrea Pirlo\u2019s side when Marega blasted in Porto\u2019s second 19 seconds into the second half.\n\nJuventus eventually mustered a response when Chiesa fired home a precious away goal with eight minutes remaining, but it was not enough to stop the 2004 champions from celebrating their first victory over the Italian club at the sixth attempt.\n\nThe winger\u2019s strike ended Porto\u2019s run of five consecutive clean sheets in the competition and leaves the tie wide open ahead of the return leg.\n\nJuve impressed in the group stage by winning five games from six, including a 3-0 final day victory at Barcelona.\n\nBut they got off to the worst start possible when Taremi anticipated Rodrigo Bentancur\u2019s pass back to Wojciech Szczesny and slid in to shoot past the goalkeeper from close range.\n\nJuve were visibly knocked off their stride by the aggression of Porto\u2019s pressing and were almost caught out again when Szczesny cleared the ball straight to Sergio Oliveira, whose shot was deflected wide.\n\nMatters were made worse for the Turin club when captain Giorgio Chiellini limped off with injury after 34 minutes.\n\nPorto were even quicker out of the blocks in the second half as Marega got on the end of a Wilson Manafa cutback to fire home within seconds of the restart.\n\nSzczesny stuck out a hand to stop an Oliveira shot from making it three, but the visitors finally came to life in the final 20 minutes.\n\nAgustin Marchesin had to scramble to palm away a deflected Chiesa shot, before the Italy international raced onto a pass to cushion a finish into the corner.\n\nThe goal made Chiesa the first Juventus player other than Cristiano Ronaldo to score a knockout stage goal in the Champions League since Blaise Matuidi in April 2018.\n\nRonaldo, the competition\u2019s all-time top scorer,

Affairs (KPDNHEP) said cases of identity theft, theft of credit card information and fraudulent offers and transactions are increasing at alarming rates.\n\n\u201cWhile e-commerce is delivering unprecedented product choice, convenience and price transparency, it also presents consumers with a number of new risks, such as identity theft and theft of credit card information. Fraudulent offers and transactions also are increasing at an alarming rate,\u201d said its minister Dato Sri Alexander Nanta Linggi.\n\nHe said this in his text of speech delivered during the 2021 Malaysia Economic and Strategic Outlook Forum in Putrajaya recently.\n\nAdditionally, e-commerce platforms are also increasingly vulnerable to a growing illicit industry distributing harmful, unsafe, substandard or faulty products \u2013 including counterfeit and pirated products, he added.\n\nAs much as 50 per cent of drugs sold through online pharmacies are counterfeits containing the wrong ingredients; random mixtures of noxious chemicals; insufficient, too much or no active ingredients; or fake packaging.\n\nIn Malaysia, there has been a total of 2,997 cases of counterfeit products reported from 2017 to 2020.\n\nCounterfeit items seized during operations included products such as food items, medicines, cosmetics electrical devices, clothing and luxury items, he added.\n\nThere has also been an increase of 112.5 per cent of online transactions complaints lodged at KPDNHEP in 2020, compared to 2019 (5,416 nos of complaints).\n\n\u201cThe upwards trend can be contributed to the change of purchasing methods \u2013 from the traditional brick-and-mortar purchases to the online platform purchases. This shows that majority of consumers in Malaysia have already adapted to the new norm of Covid-19 through their daily online transactions.\u201d\n\nNanta said these widespread online activities to target and deceive consumers present significant challenges for government and businesses to investigate and stop the flow of fake and unsafe goods.\n\n\u201cWith the prevalence of the Covid-19 pandemic, many have opted for online shopping as their primary shopping method to satisfy their buying needs while attempting to keep safe from the virus.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs more and more online retailers emerge in this ever-growing and ever-advancing market, the number of online shoppers has increased as well.\u201d\n\nAs a result, instances of online retailers taking advantage of their customers using unethical or even illegal advertising or marketing tactics to attract more customers has also increased as well, he said.\n\nHe said online retailers have many ways to increase their chances of profit-making by using pricing strategies such as \u2018yo-yo pricing\u2019 (which is increasing the price of their products when supply is low and then decreasing the price after the supply increases) and \u2018predatory pricing\u2019.\n\n\u201cPredatory pricing occurs when online businesses lower the price of their products below the manufacturing cost in hopes that it will drive their competitors out of business.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother strategy that is often deployed is when unscrupulous retailers mislead customers or consumers through \u2018fake\u2019 or misleading discounts, which many consumers are unaware of,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis was rumoured to have happened recently during the highly-anticipated yearly nationwide \u201811.11\u2019, Black Friday, and \u201912.12\u2019 sales.\u201d\n\nConsumers however can protect themselves when faced with misleading advertisements or representations by online businesses by filing a complaint with the e-commerce platforms directly.\n\nMany E-commerce platforms such as Shopee and Lazada have their own policies for dealing with misleading discounts, he said.\n\nFor example, Shopee prohibits price manipulation and fake discounts as they create a false impression of the product prices. Listings with misleading discounts will be suspended by Shopee for a first offence, with no penalty as a warning, he explained.\n\nHowever, he said, if there is any subsequent offence by the seller in the future, all listings found with the behaviour of misleading discounts will be deleted as it would be a \u2018Prohibited Listing\u2019.\n\nSimilarly, sellers on Lazada are not allowed to offer misleading discounts during the campaign period such as 11.11, 12.12 among others, he added.\n\nLazada may remove the products from listing if the sellers are found to be in breach of the policy, said Nanta.\n\nAggrieved consumers can also choose to lodge their complaints \u2013 either to the KPDNHEP Consumer Complaints Management Centre (or the PPAP) or the National Consumer Complaints Centre (NCCC) or the Ministry itself.\n\nPPAP is the official ministry\u2019s complaints channel and can be reached via the hotline 1-800-886-800, the e-Aduan system, e-mails, WhatsApp application and walk-in complainants.", "keyword": ["rise", "fraud", "misleading", "price", "complaints", "retailers", "kpdnhep", "theft", "cases", "consumers", "online", "discounts", "fake", "identity", "products"], "summary": "KUCHING (Feb 24): The Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumers Affairs (KPDNHEP) said cases of identity theft, theft of credit card information and fraudulent offers and transactions are increasing at alarming rates.\nMany E-commerce platforms such as Shopee and Lazada have their own policies for dealing with misleading discounts, he said.\nFor example, Shopee prohibits price manipulation and fake discounts as they create a false impression of the product prices.\nListings with misleading discounts will be suspended by Shopee for a first offence, with no penalty as a warning, he explained.\nSimilarly, sellers on Lazada are not allowed to offer misleading discounts during the campaign period such as 11.11, 12.12 among others, he added.", "news": "The Borneo Post", "date": "2021-02-24 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Complaints on online transactions rise 112.5%", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWFsYXlzaWFucmVzZXJ2ZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi8yMy9jb21wbGFpbnRzLW9uLW9ubGluZS10cmFuc2FjdGlvbnMtcmlzZS0xMTItNS_SAVxodHRwczovL3RoZW1hbGF5c2lhbnJlc2VydmUuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvMjMvY29tcGxhaW50cy1vbi1vbmxpbmUtdHJhbnNhY3Rpb25zLXJpc2UtMTEyLTUvYW1wLw?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://themalaysianreserve.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/19TR004A1-1.jpg", "text": "by LYDIA NATHAN / Pic by RAZAK GHAZALI\n\nTHE Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) has recorded an increase of 112.5% in complaints last year, compared to 5,416 complaints in 2019, vastly due to the shift from traditional brick-and-mortar purchases to online platforms.\n\nMinister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi (picture) said as online retailers are mushrooming, so have unethical or even illegal advertising and marketing tactics to attract more customers.\n\n\u201cThere are many ways to increase profit-making, like \u2018yo-yo pricing\u2019 \u2014 which is increasing prices when there is low supply, but decreasing it when supply is plenty,\u201d he said yesterday at 2021 Malaysia Economic and Strategic Outlook Forum entitled \u201cThe Post-Covid New Normal \u2014 Where Do We Go from Here\u201d.\n\nNanta Linggi said the complaints also included predatory pricing, or lowering prices below manufacturing costs in an aim to drive competitors out of business.\n\n\u201cAnother strategy often deployed is when retailers mislead consumers through fake discounts, which allegedly took place during the highly anticipated 11.11, Black Friday and 12.12 nationwide sales,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Nanta Linggi, even though e-commerce has proven to be convenient and the choice for most, it has also presented consumers with risks, including identity theft and credit card fraud.\n\n\u201cFraudulent offers and transactions are also increasing at alarming rates.

several major players in the creative industry, digital piracy has also robbed the government off some RM500 million in government taxes while putting thousands of jobs at risk.\n\nStar Media Group chief marketing officer Lam Swee Kim said the penalty being imposed should reflect how severe the act of piracy impacts the industry and the act of fuelling piracy in terms of monetisation or remuneration should also be monitored and penalised.\n\nThe authorities are also urged to take action against key enablers of digital piracy by blocking illegal streaming sites over the Internet and

The penalty should be heavier. The value of content being pirated is definitely higher than the fine of only RM30,000,\u201d Zahrin said.\n\nEradicating digital piracy requires collaborative efforts by all parties from content providers, broadcasters, regulators, authorities and consumers to telecommunication companies, Internet service and e-commerce providers.

cannot guarantee that leaders from his new party Pejuang will not resort to party-hopping even if they swore on the Quran not to do so.\n\nHe said several leaders of his former party PPBM had taken similar pledges before the 2018 general election but that it \u201cdid not stop them from becoming traitors\u201d.\n\nMukhriz said this today when talking about how top leaders of Pejuang, which has sought registration as a political party, had sworn on the holy book to uphold the party\u2019s values.\n\n\u201cWhatever screening (for leaders) we do, in the end, it\u2019s up to the individual if they want to party-hop or leave the party.

little went Juventus\u2019s way, Federico Chiesa\u2019s late strike at least handed them a lifeline going into the return leg in Turin on March 9.\n\nTaremi pounced on a sloppy back pass after 63 seconds to fire in the opener that left Juventus rattled as they failed to create any meaningful chances before halftime.\n\nThings got worse for Andrea Pirlo\u2019s side when Marega blasted in Porto\u2019s second 19 seconds into the second half.\n\nJuventus eventually mustered a response when Chiesa fired home a precious away goal with eight minutes remaining, but it was not enough to stop the 2004 champions from celebrating their first victory over the Italian club at the sixth attempt.\n\nThe winger\u2019s strike ended Porto\u2019s run of five consecutive clean sheets in the competition and leaves the tie wide open ahead of the return leg.\n\nJuve impressed in the group stage by winning five games from six, including a 3-0 final day victory at Barcelona.\n\nBut they got off to the worst start possible when Taremi anticipated Rodrigo Bentancur\u2019s pass back to Wojciech Szczesny and slid in to shoot past the goalkeeper from close range.\n\nJuve were visibly knocked off their stride by the aggression of Porto\u2019s pressing and were almost caught out again when Szczesny cleared the ball straight to Sergio Oliveira, whose shot was deflected wide.\n\nMatters were made worse for the Turin club when captain Giorgio Chiellini limped off with injury after 34 minutes.\n\nPorto were even quicker out of the blocks in the second half as Marega got on the end of a Wilson Manafa cutback to fire home within seconds of the restart.\n\nSzczesny stuck out a hand to stop an Oliveira shot from making it three, but the visitors finally came to life in the final 20 minutes.\n\nAgustin Marchesin had to scramble to palm away a deflected Chiesa shot, before the Italy international raced onto a pass to cushion a finish into the corner.\n\nThe goal made Chiesa the first Juventus player other than Cristiano Ronaldo to score a knockout stage goal in the Champions League since Blaise Matuidi in April 2018.\n\nRonaldo, the competition\u2019s all-time top scorer,
