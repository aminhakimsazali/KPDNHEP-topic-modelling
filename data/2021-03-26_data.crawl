corporates and NGOs to encourage more Malaysians to sign up for the Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nScience, Technology and Innovation Minister Khairy Jamaluddin Abu Bakar (picture) said Pos Malaysia Bhd, Grab Malaysia, Parkson Corp Sdn Bhd, Living Minds Sdn Bhd and St John Ambulance of Malaysia (SJAM) will join forces with the government to raise awareness of the vaccine.\n\nKhairy, who is also the coordinating minister for the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme (PICK), said these partnerships are expected to increase the number of vaccine registrations for Covid-19 in the country.\n\n\u201cThe priority for all the partners is to utilise their ubiquitous presence by distributing flyers door-to-door in rural areas and states with low registration rates, whether through delivery, retail, the NGO sector or athletes who are also influencers.\n\n\u201cWe hope this effort will convince and influence more people in the country to register for the vaccination,\u201d he said in a virtual media briefing after launching the corporate collaboration for PICK yesterday.\n\nUnder the collaboration, he said Pos Malaysia will launch a special Covid-19 stamp edition to appreciate frontliners and a #BersamaMencegahCovid-19 campaign to boost vaccine registration.\n\nHe added that Pos Malaysia will also send flyers door-to-door, while delivering parcels to their customers.\n\n\u201cInformation posters on vaccination are also provided at post offices throughout Malaysia.\n\n\u201cIn the meantime, Pos Malaysia\u2019s social media platform will also be used to channel information on the immunisation programme to the public,\u201d he noted.\n\nThe minister also said he will be happy to consider the request from Pos Malaysia to categorise postmen as frontliners to be inoculated in the near future.\n\nMeanwhile, in collaboration with Grab Malaysia, Khairy said the e-hailing provider will display advertisements on their application, in which it will have a direct link to MySejahtera to facilitate people on the vaccine registration process.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, Grab will provide updated and accurate information about the vaccination programme via its application to users.\n\n\u201cWe are also planning to discuss further on how we can map out vaccination centres and ensure those with appointments can easily get e-hailing rides from their homes.\n\n\u201cWe hope that we can utilise a similar partnership that we had during the SEA Games previously to identify drop-off points for vaccination centres,\u201d he added.\n\nKhairy also noted that Grab drivers will be considered to be included in the upcoming phases of vaccination, which will involve economic frontliners.\n\nCommenting on local sports marketing company Living Minds, Khairy said the company has come forward to offer 12 professional football players under their management as vaccination ambassadors, as well as to help spread the message on vaccination through their social media platform.\n\nHe hoped that the message from top athletes and footballers will encourage people in the sports sector to get themselves inoculated in order to allow the industry to\n\noperate in full force again. Meanwhile, Parkson Corp has agreed to set up vaccination registration counters in 20 selected retail stores to assist people with the vaccine registration process.\n\nApart from corporate groups, SJAM will mobilise volunteers to publicise the vaccination programme, while assisting people on the registration through MySejahtera.\n\nThe minister said SJAM will also provide ambulance and medical teams at vaccination centres for emergency support.\n\nHe added that SJAM will also be doing blood donation drives in 50 locations nationwide from May 28 to May 30, and set up counters for volunteers to help the public with vaccine registration.\n\nAccording to Khairy, there are currently about seven million people who have registered for the vaccination programme in the country.\n\n\u201cI think it is a decent start.

growth since it debuted in May 2020\n\nBy LYDIA NATHAN / Pics courtesy of Snappea\n\nTHE concept of non-dairy milk is no longer new as it is a trending diet, with the dairy alternative market set to reach RM186.7 billion by 2027.\n\nIt\u2019s also interesting to note that 65% of people today have a reduced ability to digest lactose after the infancy stage.\n\nBranding itself as the first pea milk in Asia, Snappea hits the ground running, with consistent achievement of double-digit growth since it debuted in May 2020, as the popularity of plant-based milk has continued soaring not just in Malaysia, but globally as well.\n\nWith many arising concerns over the cruelty and lack of sustainability efforts of the dairy industry, more and more people have begun looking into alternatives on the shelves \u2014 vegans and non-vegans alike.\n\nSnappea founders Justin Chan and Phoebe Cheong said it was a timely launch despite being in the middle of the Movement Control Order last year. It was also launched on e-commerce platforms simultaneously.\n\nChan said the brand \u2014 which is certified halal by the Department of Islamic Development Malaysia \u2014 is currently one of the top three plant-based milks on Lazada, alongside two other international brands.\n\n\u201cSince we launched both in-store and online in less than 10 months, we have done well. We have successfully listed in more than 120 retail outlets, including big retail chains such as Jaya Grocer, Village Grocer, AEON, Ben\u2019s Independent Grocer, Lazada, Shopee and others.\n\n\u201cHowever, we believe we have barely 1% done in our mission to promote pea as one of the most sustainable food sources in the world,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve in an interview recently.\n\nSnappea is made with 100% non-genetically modified organism (GMO) Canadian peas, which is high in protein and has 0% cholesterol, and comes in three flavours: Utterly Original, Simply Unsweetened and Richly Chocolate.\n\nChan said the uniqueness of the milk is its taste and texture, as he noticed other plan-based milk had drawbacks of their own.\n\n\u201cWe noticed some plant-based milk had a watery consistency and a bland taste, nutritionally-inferior, especially for its low protein and low calcium contents.\n\n\u201cFor example, one cup of almond milk contains one gramme (1g) of protein. Besides that, there were also prevailing environmental concerns within the market surrounding unsustainable farming practices, excessive carbon footprint and high-water usage,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the company created something better using one of the most sustainable food sources in the world \u2014 peas.\n\n\u201cSnappea contains 10g of plant-based protein per cup, which is 10 times more than almond milk and 20% more than cow\u2019s milk. Each cup of Snappea also contains 170mg plant-based calcium,\u201d Chan noted.\n\nHe said Richly Chocolate has been the bestseller so far as it contains half the sugar of regular chocolate milk, but without any added preservatives.\n\nMeanwhile, Chan said sales are expected to be strong and the growth would continue in the next two to three years, as the brand has barely scratched the surface of the milk alternative market.\n\n\u201cMoving forward in 2021, we will be focusing on expanding our penetration locally in Malaysia and our neighbouring country, Singa- pore. As the first pea milk in Asia, there\u2019s a lot of awareness and education about peas that need to be done in the market,\u201d he said.\n\nThe brand will also look into having more retailers offer Snappea\u2019s products, in an aim to make it more accessible to a wider group of consumers.\n\n\u201cAnd of course, as a pea-focused company with a mission to educate about the sustainability and health benefits of peas, there are more pea-based products in the pipeline and we will definitely share more with our consumers when things get clearer,\u201d Chan said.", "keyword": ["momentum",

resulted in a reduction of RM21.5 billion and in significant realignments.\n\nAt the time, these renegotiations were initiated as a cost-saving exercise as 85% of the project costs were being funded

the Covid-19 pandemic are urged to immediately apply for the restructuring of installment payments from banking institutions and credit companies.\n\nDomestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) Deputy Minister Datuk Rosol Wahid said since the Temporary Measures for Government Financing (Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19)) Bill 2020 to help those affected by Covid-19 was gazetted in December last year, only about 25 per cent or 267 bus operators had applied for the restructuring.\n\n\u201cThere are more than 1,000 bus operators nationwide but the number that have applied for the restructuring is less than 30 per cent. The results of an analysis found that as many as 75 per cent of bus operators have not made the application.\n\n\u201cThis number is quite low given the problems they face. So we hope those (bus operators) who are in trouble would come and discuss with banking institutions or credit companies,\u201d he told reporters after officiating the Terengganu Bus Operators 2021 annual general meeting, here today.\n\nHe said of the 267 bus operators that had applied for restructuring, 195 were approved while the remaining 74 companies failed in their applications due to various factors such as high outstanding arrears.\n\nIn the meantime, Rosol said the bus operators\u2019 associations nationwide should play their roles in publicising the facility on restructuring installment payment so that more bus operators can enjoy the assistance provided by the government.\n\nHe said the government through other ministries also played their respective roles to help the group, among others through the Bus and Taxi Hire Purchase Rehabilitation Scheme, Perlindungan Ekonomi Dan Rakyat Malaysia (PERMAI), flexibility in borrowing conditions, 50 per cent exemption on all interest charges and payments as well as creating a Covid Mediation Centre (PMC).\n\nHe said the restructuring was also aimed at preventing their vehicles from being repossessed by banking institutions and credit companies when installment payments were not made. \u2013 Bernama", "keyword": ["apply", "restructuring", "rosol", "payment", "payments", "cent", "companies", "operators",

corporates and NGOs to encourage more Malaysians to sign up for the Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nScience, Technology and Innovation Minister Khairy Jamaluddin Abu Bakar (picture) said Pos Malaysia Bhd, Grab Malaysia, Parkson Corp Sdn Bhd, Living Minds Sdn Bhd and St John Ambulance of Malaysia (SJAM) will join forces with the government to raise awareness of the vaccine.\n\nKhairy, who is also the coordinating minister for the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme (PICK), said these partnerships are expected to increase the number of vaccine registrations for Covid-19 in the country.\n\n\u201cThe priority for all the partners is to utilise their ubiquitous presence by distributing flyers door-to-door in rural areas and states with low registration rates, whether through delivery, retail, the NGO sector or athletes who are also influencers.\n\n\u201cWe hope this effort will convince and influence more people in the country to register for the vaccination,\u201d he said in a virtual media briefing after launching the corporate collaboration for PICK yesterday.\n\nUnder the collaboration, he said Pos Malaysia will launch a special Covid-19 stamp edition to appreciate frontliners and a #BersamaMencegahCovid-19 campaign to boost vaccine registration.\n\nHe added that Pos Malaysia will also send flyers door-to-door, while delivering parcels to their customers.\n\n\u201cInformation posters on vaccination are also provided at post offices throughout Malaysia.\n\n\u201cIn the meantime, Pos Malaysia\u2019s social media platform will also be used to channel information on the immunisation programme to the public,\u201d he noted.\n\nThe minister also said he will be happy to consider the request from Pos Malaysia to categorise postmen as frontliners to be inoculated in the near future.\n\nMeanwhile, in collaboration with Grab Malaysia, Khairy said the e-hailing provider will display advertisements on their application, in which it will have a direct link to MySejahtera to facilitate people on the vaccine registration process.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, Grab will provide updated and accurate information about the vaccination programme via its application to users.\n\n\u201cWe are also planning to discuss further on how we can map out vaccination centres and ensure those with appointments can easily get e-hailing rides from their homes.\n\n\u201cWe hope that we can utilise a similar partnership that we had during the SEA Games previously to identify drop-off points for vaccination centres,\u201d he added.\n\nKhairy also noted that Grab drivers will be considered to be included in the upcoming phases of vaccination, which will involve economic frontliners.\n\nCommenting on local sports marketing company Living Minds, Khairy said the company has come forward to offer 12 professional football players under their management as vaccination ambassadors, as well as to help spread the message on vaccination through their social media platform.\n\nHe hoped that the message from top athletes and footballers will encourage people in the sports sector to get themselves inoculated in order to allow the industry to\n\noperate in full force again. Meanwhile, Parkson Corp has agreed to set up vaccination registration counters in 20 selected retail stores to assist people with the vaccine registration process.\n\nApart from corporate groups, SJAM will mobilise volunteers to publicise the vaccination programme, while assisting people on the registration through MySejahtera.\n\nThe minister said SJAM will also provide ambulance and medical teams at vaccination centres for emergency support.\n\nHe added that SJAM will also be doing blood donation drives in 50 locations nationwide from May 28 to May 30, and set up counters for volunteers to help the public with vaccine registration.\n\nAccording to Khairy, there are currently about seven million people who have registered for the vaccination programme in the country.\n\n\u201cI think it is a decent start.

Knowing the existence of bad hats and corrupt individuals, they are not sufficiently convinced to come forward to register.\n\n\u201cAt least, when agents were allowed to register on behalf of others, the risk was lower,\u201d he said.\n\nThirty thousand foreign workers have registered for the department\u2019s \u201crecalibration programme\u201d since it was launched last Nov 16 and MEF has said the figure represented only a little more than 2% of the estimated number of migrant workers.\n\nPereira said most foreign workers were aware they would have to face poor working conditions, be forced to live in horrible accommodation and receive low pay after being legalised.\n\n\u201cWe have created an artificial labour environment and we have ourselves to blame,\u201d he said.\n\nFormer human resources minister M Kula Segaran said bureaucratic procedures were to blame for the reluctance of employers or workers to sign up for the programme.\n\nHe said the online system was difficult to use and most applicants were being asked to go to Putrajaya to complete their registration.\n\nHe suggested that the process be decentralised to the district and state labour offices.\n\nKula also said all matters relating to foreign employment ought to be handled by the human resources ministry alone. Currently, some functions are handled by the home affairs ministry.\n\n\u201cAmong 64 countries with a similar labour system, Malaysia is the only country to have foreign employment matters overseen by the home ministry instead of human resource authorities.\n\n\u201cThe home ministry should focus on security.

growth since it debuted in May 2020\n\nBy LYDIA NATHAN / Pics courtesy of Snappea\n\nTHE concept of non-dairy milk is no longer new as it is a trending diet, with the dairy alternative market set to reach RM186.7 billion by 2027.\n\nIt\u2019s also interesting to note that 65% of people today have a reduced ability to digest lactose after the infancy stage.\n\nBranding itself as the first pea milk in Asia, Snappea hits the ground running, with consistent achievement of double-digit growth since it debuted in May 2020, as the popularity of plant-based milk has continued soaring not just in Malaysia, but globally as well.\n\nWith many arising concerns over the cruelty and lack of sustainability efforts of the dairy industry, more and more people have begun looking into alternatives on the shelves \u2014 vegans and non-vegans alike.\n\nSnappea founders Justin Chan and Phoebe Cheong said it was a timely launch despite being in the middle of the Movement Control Order last year. It was also launched on e-commerce platforms simultaneously.\n\nChan said the brand \u2014 which is certified halal by the Department of Islamic Development Malaysia \u2014 is currently one of the top three plant-based milks on Lazada, alongside two other international brands.\n\n\u201cSince we launched both in-store and online in less than 10 months, we have done well. We have successfully listed in more than 120 retail outlets, including big retail chains such as Jaya Grocer, Village Grocer, AEON, Ben\u2019s Independent Grocer, Lazada, Shopee and others.\n\n\u201cHowever, we believe we have barely 1% done in our mission to promote pea as one of the most sustainable food sources in the world,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve in an interview recently.\n\nSnappea is made with 100% non-genetically modified organism (GMO) Canadian peas, which is high in protein and has 0% cholesterol, and comes in three flavours: Utterly Original, Simply Unsweetened and Richly Chocolate.\n\nChan said the uniqueness of the milk is its taste and texture, as he noticed other plan-based milk had drawbacks of their own.\n\n\u201cWe noticed some plant-based milk had a watery consistency and a bland taste, nutritionally-inferior, especially for its low protein and low calcium contents.\n\n\u201cFor example, one cup of almond milk contains one gramme (1g) of protein. Besides that, there were also prevailing environmental concerns within the market surrounding unsustainable farming practices, excessive carbon footprint and high-water usage,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the company created something better using one of the most sustainable food sources in the world \u2014 peas.\n\n\u201cSnappea contains 10g of plant-based protein per cup, which is 10 times more than almond milk and 20% more than cow\u2019s milk. Each cup of Snappea also contains 170mg plant-based calcium,\u201d Chan noted.\n\nHe said Richly Chocolate has been the bestseller so far as it contains half the sugar of regular chocolate milk, but without any added preservatives.\n\nMeanwhile, Chan said sales are expected to be strong and the growth would continue in the next two to three years, as the brand has barely scratched the surface of the milk alternative market.\n\n\u201cMoving forward in 2021, we will be focusing on expanding our penetration locally in Malaysia and our neighbouring country, Singa- pore. As the first pea milk in Asia, there\u2019s a lot of awareness and education about peas that need to be done in the market,\u201d he said.\n\nThe brand will also look into having more retailers offer Snappea\u2019s products, in an aim to make it more accessible to a wider group of consumers.\n\n\u201cAnd of course, as a pea-focused company with a mission to educate about the sustainability and health benefits of peas, there are more pea-based products in the pipeline and we will definitely share more with our consumers when things get clearer,\u201d Chan said.", "keyword": ["momentum",

which IDEAS expects to increase by 58% this year.\n\n\u201cThis transparency is key to ensure accountability and efficient use of public funds,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nThe government also needs to ensure that the decisions made around the 665km project were based on achieving value for money and high-quality service delivery,\u201d and not subject to political agenda\u201d.\n\nTwo days

resulted in a reduction of RM21.5 billion and in significant realignments.\n\nAt the time, these renegotiations were initiated as a cost-saving exercise as 85% of the project costs were being funded through a loan from EXIM Bank which has a 3.25% interest rate and seven-year repayment moratorium.\n\n\u201cAlthough the transport minister has argued that the prior revised costs under the PH administration had excluded certain other expenditures, IDEAS stresses that the conflicting information coming out concerning the ECRL project points to the need for greater transparency.\u201d\n\nShe

coordinating minister for the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme (PICK), said these partnerships are expected to increase the number of vaccine registrations for Covid-19 in the country.\n\n\u201cThe priority for all the partners is to utilise their ubiquitous presence by distributing flyers door-to-door in rural areas and states with low registration rates, whether through delivery, retail, the NGO sector or athletes who are also influencers.\n\n\u201cWe hope this effort will convince and influence more people in the country to register for the vaccination,\u201d he said in a virtual media briefing after launching the corporate collaboration for PICK yesterday.\n\nUnder the collaboration, he said Pos Malaysia will launch a special Covid-19 stamp edition to appreciate frontliners and a #BersamaMencegahCovid-19 campaign to boost vaccine registration.\n\nHe added that Pos Malaysia will also send flyers door-to-door, while delivering parcels to their customers.\n\n\u201cInformation posters on vaccination are also provided at post offices throughout Malaysia.\n\n\u201cIn the meantime, Pos Malaysia\u2019s social media platform will also be used to channel information on the immunisation programme to the public,\u201d he noted.\n\nThe minister also said he will be happy to consider the request from Pos Malaysia to categorise postmen as frontliners to be inoculated in the near future.\n\nMeanwhile, in collaboration with Grab Malaysia, Khairy said the e-hailing provider will display advertisements on their application, in which it will have a direct link to MySejahtera to facilitate people on the vaccine registration process.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, Grab will provide updated and accurate information about the vaccination programme via its application to users.\n\n\u201cWe are also planning to discuss further on how we can map out vaccination centres and ensure those with appointments can easily get e-hailing rides from their homes.\n\n\u201cWe hope that we can utilise a similar partnership that we had during the SEA Games previously to identify drop-off points for vaccination centres,\u201d he added.\n\nKhairy also noted that Grab drivers will be considered to be included in the upcoming phases of vaccination, which will involve economic frontliners.\n\nCommenting on local sports marketing company Living Minds, Khairy said the company has come forward to offer 12 professional football players under their management as vaccination ambassadors, as well as to help spread the message on vaccination through their social media platform.\n\nHe hoped that the message from top athletes and footballers will encourage people in the sports sector to get themselves inoculated in order to allow the industry to\n\noperate in full force again. Meanwhile, Parkson Corp has agreed to set up vaccination registration counters in 20 selected retail stores to assist people with the vaccine registration process.\n\nApart from corporate groups, SJAM will mobilise volunteers to publicise the vaccination programme, while assisting people on the registration through MySejahtera.\n\nThe minister said SJAM will also provide ambulance and medical teams at vaccination centres for emergency support.\n\nHe added that SJAM will also be doing blood donation drives in 50 locations nationwide from May 28 to May 30, and set up counters for volunteers to help the public with vaccine registration.\n\nAccording to Khairy, there are currently about seven million people who have registered for the vaccination programme in the country.\n\n\u201cI think it is a decent start. However, the preparations that we are doing now are in anticipation of a mass vaccination exercise that will take place from June onwards,\u201d he noted.\n\nRead our previous report here", "keyword": ["vaccination", "grab", "sjam", "khairy", "boost", "corporates", "help", "registrations", "registration", "covid19", "collaboration", "minister", "ngos", "programme", "vaccine"], "summary": "by S BIRRUNTHA / pic by RAZAK GHAZALITHE government is collaborating with corporates and NGOs to encourage more Malaysians to sign up for the Covid-19 vaccine.\nUnder the collaboration, he said Pos Malaysia will launch a special Covid-19 stamp edition to appreciate frontliners and a #BersamaMencegahCovid-19 campaign to boost vaccine registration.\n\u201cAdditionally, Grab will provide updated and accurate information about the vaccination programme via its application to users.\nMeanwhile, Parkson Corp has agreed to set up vaccination registration counters in 20 selected retail stores to assist people with the vaccine registration process.\nAccording to Khairy, there are currently about seven million people who have registered for the vaccination programme in the country.", "news": "The Malaysian Reserve", "date": "2021-04-01 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "M\u2019sians Mad At Blank Interstate Travel Permits Already Signed & Approved, Police Say They\u2019re Investigating", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVyYWt5YXRwb3N0LmNvbS9uZXdzL21hbGF5c2lhLzIwMjEvMDQvMDgvbXNpYW5zLW1hZC1hdC1ibGFuay1pbnRlcnN0YXRlLXRyYXZlbC1wZXJtaXRzLWFscmVhZHktc2lnbmVkLWFwcHJvdmVkLXBvbGljZS1zYXktdGhleXJlLWludmVzdGlnYXRpbmcv0gGhAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wNC8wOC9tc2lhbnMtbWFkLWF0LWJsYW5rLWludGVyc3RhdGUtdHJhdmVsLXBlcm1pdHMtYWxyZWFkeS1zaWduZWQtYXBwcm92ZWQtcG9saWNlLXNheS10aGV5cmUtaW52ZXN0aWdhdGluZy9hbXAv?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Kirat Kaur", "Maya Suraya", "Azizul Rahman Ismail"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/pre-approved-police-form-interstate-travel.jpg", "text": "Subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates.\n\nUnder the nationwide Movement Control Order (MCO), interstate travel is not allowed without police approval.

growth since it debuted in May 2020\n\nBy LYDIA NATHAN / Pics courtesy of Snappea\n\nTHE concept of non-dairy milk is no longer new as it is a trending diet, with the dairy alternative market set to reach RM186.7 billion by 2027.\n\nIt\u2019s also interesting to note that 65% of people today have a reduced ability to digest lactose after the infancy stage.\n\nBranding itself as the first pea milk in Asia, Snappea hits the ground running, with consistent achievement of double-digit growth since it debuted in May 2020, as the popularity of plant-based milk has continued soaring not just in Malaysia, but globally as well.\n\nWith many arising concerns over the cruelty and lack of sustainability efforts of the dairy industry, more and more people have begun looking into alternatives on the shelves \u2014 vegans and non-vegans alike.\n\nSnappea founders Justin Chan and Phoebe Cheong said it was a timely launch despite being in the middle of the Movement Control Order last year. It was also launched on e-commerce platforms simultaneously.\n\nChan said the brand \u2014 which is certified halal by the Department of Islamic Development Malaysia \u2014 is currently one of the top three plant-based milks on Lazada, alongside two other international brands.\n\n\u201cSince we launched both in-store and online in less than 10 months, we have done well. We have successfully listed in more than 120 retail outlets, including big retail chains such as Jaya Grocer, Village Grocer, AEON, Ben\u2019s Independent Grocer, Lazada, Shopee and others.\n\n\u201cHowever, we believe we have barely 1% done in our mission to promote pea as one of the most sustainable food sources in the world,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve in an interview recently.\n\nSnappea is made with 100% non-genetically modified organism (GMO) Canadian peas, which is high in protein and has 0% cholesterol, and comes in three flavours: Utterly Original, Simply Unsweetened and Richly Chocolate.\n\nChan said the uniqueness of the milk is its taste and texture, as he noticed other plan-based milk had drawbacks of their own.\n\n\u201cWe noticed some plant-based milk had a watery consistency and a bland taste, nutritionally-inferior, especially for its low protein and low calcium contents.\n\n\u201cFor example, one cup of almond milk contains one gramme (1g) of protein. Besides that, there were also prevailing environmental concerns within the market surrounding unsustainable farming practices, excessive carbon footprint and high-water usage,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the company created something better using one of the most sustainable food sources in the world \u2014 peas.\n\n\u201cSnappea contains 10g of plant-based protein per cup, which is 10 times more than almond milk and 20% more than cow\u2019s milk. Each cup of Snappea also contains 170mg plant-based calcium,\u201d Chan noted.\n\nHe said Richly Chocolate has been the bestseller so far as it contains half the sugar of regular chocolate milk, but without any added preservatives.\n\nMeanwhile, Chan said sales are expected to be strong and the growth would continue in the next two to three years, as the brand has barely scratched the surface of the milk alternative market.\n\n\u201cMoving forward in 2021, we will be focusing on expanding our penetration locally in Malaysia and our neighbouring country, Singa- pore. As the first pea milk in Asia, there\u2019s a lot of awareness and education about peas that need to be done in the market,\u201d he said.\n\nThe brand will also look into having more retailers offer Snappea\u2019s products, in an aim to make it more accessible to a wider group of consumers.\n\n\u201cAnd of course, as a pea-focused company with a mission to educate about the sustainability and health benefits of peas, there are more pea-based products in the pipeline and we will definitely share more with our consumers when things get clearer,\u201d Chan said.", "keyword": ["momentum",

interest rate.\n\nIDEAS chief executive officer Tricia Yeoh said release of the details would allow the public to assess the project\u2019s financial feasibility and the implications for public debt, which IDEAS expects to increase by 58% this year.\n\n\u201cThis transparency is key to ensure accountability and efficient use of public funds,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nThe government also needs to ensure that the decisions made around the 665km project were based on achieving value for money and high-quality service delivery,\u201d and not subject to political agenda\u201d.\n\nTwo days ago, the transport ministry said the ECRL, which will now be known as ECRL 3.0, will revert to the northern alignment to connect Pahang and Selangor as previously planned by the Barisan Nasional administration.\n\nConstruction will take seven years and the ECRL will be operational in 2027.\n\nYeoh said that when the project was renegotiated by the previous Pakatan Harapan government, it had resulted in a reduction of RM21.5 billion and in significant realignments.\n\nAt the time, these renegotiations were initiated as a cost-saving exercise as 85% of the project costs were being funded through a loan from EXIM Bank which has a 3.25% interest rate and seven-year repayment moratorium.\n\n\u201cAlthough the transport minister has argued that the prior revised costs under the PH administration had excluded certain other expenditures, IDEAS stresses that the conflicting information coming out concerning the ECRL project points to the need for greater transparency.\u201d\n\nShe also said there was \u201ca serious lack of coordination\u201d between federal and state governments in the process.\n\nThis was based on Selangor state executive councillor Teng Chang Khim\u2019s

state government has completed the preliminary works required for land acquisition for the southern alignment under the \u201cECRL 2.0\u201d.\n\n\u201cSince these incurred costs are unrecoverable, the

corporates and NGOs to encourage more Malaysians to sign up for the Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nScience, Technology and Innovation Minister Khairy Jamaluddin Abu Bakar (picture) said Pos Malaysia Bhd, Grab Malaysia, Parkson Corp Sdn Bhd, Living Minds Sdn Bhd and St John Ambulance of Malaysia (SJAM) will join forces with the government to raise awareness of the vaccine.\n\nKhairy, who is also the coordinating minister for the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme (PICK), said these partnerships are expected to increase the number of vaccine registrations for Covid-19 in the country.\n\n\u201cThe priority for all the partners is to utilise their ubiquitous presence by distributing flyers door-to-door in rural areas and states with low registration rates, whether through delivery, retail, the NGO sector or athletes who are also influencers.\n\n\u201cWe hope this effort will convince and influence more people in the country to register for the vaccination,\u201d he said in a virtual media briefing after launching the corporate collaboration for PICK yesterday.\n\nUnder the collaboration, he said Pos Malaysia will launch a special Covid-19 stamp edition to appreciate frontliners and a #BersamaMencegahCovid-19 campaign to boost vaccine registration.\n\nHe added that Pos Malaysia will also send flyers door-to-door, while delivering parcels to their customers.\n\n\u201cInformation posters on vaccination are also provided at post offices throughout Malaysia.\n\n\u201cIn the meantime, Pos Malaysia\u2019s social media platform will also be used to channel information on the immunisation programme to the public,\u201d he noted.\n\nThe minister also said he will be happy to consider the request from Pos Malaysia to categorise postmen as frontliners to be inoculated in the near future.\n\nMeanwhile, in collaboration with Grab Malaysia, Khairy said the e-hailing provider will display advertisements on their application, in which it will have a direct link to MySejahtera to facilitate people on the vaccine registration process.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, Grab will provide updated and accurate information about the vaccination programme via its application to users.\n\n\u201cWe are also planning to discuss further on how we can map out vaccination centres and ensure those with appointments can easily get e-hailing rides from their homes.\n\n\u201cWe hope that we can utilise a similar partnership that we had during the SEA Games previously to identify drop-off points for vaccination centres,\u201d he added.\n\nKhairy also noted that Grab drivers will be considered to be included in the upcoming phases of vaccination, which will involve economic frontliners.\n\nCommenting on local sports marketing company Living Minds, Khairy said the company has come forward to offer 12 professional football players under their management as vaccination ambassadors, as well as to help spread the message on vaccination through their social media platform.\n\nHe hoped that the message from top athletes and footballers will encourage people in the sports sector to get themselves inoculated in order to allow the industry to\n\noperate in full force again. Meanwhile, Parkson Corp has agreed to set up vaccination registration counters in 20 selected retail stores to assist people with the vaccine registration process.\n\nApart from corporate groups, SJAM will mobilise volunteers to publicise the vaccination programme, while assisting people on the registration through MySejahtera.\n\nThe minister said SJAM will also provide ambulance and medical teams at vaccination centres for emergency support.\n\nHe added that SJAM will also be doing blood donation drives in 50 locations nationwide from May 28 to May 30, and set up counters for volunteers to help the public with vaccine registration.\n\nAccording to Khairy, there are currently about seven million people who have registered for the vaccination programme in the country.\n\n\u201cI think it is a decent start.

growth since it debuted in May 2020\n\nBy LYDIA NATHAN / Pics courtesy of Snappea\n\nTHE concept of non-dairy milk is no longer new as it is a trending diet, with the dairy alternative market set to reach RM186.7 billion by 2027.\n\nIt\u2019s also interesting to note that 65% of people today have a reduced ability to digest lactose after the infancy stage.\n\nBranding itself as the first pea milk in Asia, Snappea hits the ground running, with consistent achievement of double-digit growth since it debuted in May 2020, as the popularity of plant-based milk has continued soaring not just in Malaysia, but globally as well.\n\nWith many arising concerns over the cruelty and lack of sustainability efforts of the dairy industry, more and more people have begun looking into alternatives on the shelves \u2014 vegans and non-vegans alike.\n\nSnappea founders Justin Chan and Phoebe Cheong said it was a timely launch despite being in the middle of the Movement Control Order last year. It was also launched on e-commerce platforms simultaneously.\n\nChan said the brand \u2014 which is certified halal by the Department of Islamic Development Malaysia \u2014 is currently one of the top three plant-based milks on Lazada, alongside two other international brands.\n\n\u201cSince we launched both in-store and online in less than 10 months, we have done well. We have successfully listed in more than 120 retail outlets, including big retail chains such as Jaya Grocer, Village Grocer, AEON, Ben\u2019s Independent Grocer, Lazada, Shopee and others.\n\n\u201cHowever, we believe we have barely 1% done in our mission to promote pea as one of the most sustainable food sources in the world,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve in an interview recently.\n\nSnappea is made with 100% non-genetically modified organism (GMO) Canadian peas, which is high in protein and has 0% cholesterol, and comes in three flavours: Utterly Original, Simply Unsweetened and Richly Chocolate.\n\nChan said the uniqueness of the milk is its taste and texture, as he noticed other plan-based milk had drawbacks of their own.\n\n\u201cWe noticed some plant-based milk had a watery consistency and a bland taste, nutritionally-inferior, especially for its low protein and low calcium contents.\n\n\u201cFor example, one cup of almond milk contains one gramme (1g) of protein. Besides that, there were also prevailing environmental concerns within the market surrounding unsustainable farming practices, excessive carbon footprint and high-water usage,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the company created something better using one of the most sustainable food sources in the world \u2014 peas.\n\n\u201cSnappea contains 10g of plant-based protein per cup, which is 10 times more than almond milk and 20% more than cow\u2019s milk. Each cup of Snappea also contains 170mg plant-based calcium,\u201d Chan noted.\n\nHe said Richly Chocolate has been the bestseller so far as it contains half the sugar of regular chocolate milk, but without any added preservatives.\n\nMeanwhile, Chan said sales are expected to be strong and the growth would continue in the next two to three years, as the brand has barely scratched the surface of the milk alternative market.\n\n\u201cMoving forward in 2021, we will be focusing on expanding our penetration locally in Malaysia and our neighbouring country, Singa- pore. As the first pea milk in Asia, there\u2019s a lot of awareness and education about peas that need to be done in the market,\u201d he said.\n\nThe brand will also look into having more retailers offer Snappea\u2019s products, in an aim to make it more accessible to a wider group of consumers.\n\n\u201cAnd of course, as a pea-focused company with a mission to educate about the sustainability and health benefits of peas, there are more pea-based products in the pipeline and we will definitely share more with our consumers when things get clearer,\u201d Chan said.", "keyword": ["momentum",

resulted in a reduction of RM21.5 billion and in significant realignments.\n\nAt the time, these renegotiations were initiated as a cost-saving exercise as 85% of the project costs were being funded

the Covid-19 pandemic are urged to immediately apply for the restructuring of installment payments from banking institutions and credit companies.\n\nDomestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) Deputy Minister Datuk Rosol Wahid said since the Temporary Measures for Government Financing (Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19)) Bill 2020 to help those affected by Covid-19 was gazetted in December last year, only about 25 per cent or 267 bus operators had applied for the restructuring.\n\n\u201cThere are more than 1,000 bus operators nationwide but the number that have applied for the restructuring is less than 30 per cent. The results of an analysis found that as many as 75 per cent of bus operators have not made the application.\n\n\u201cThis number is quite low given the problems they face. So we hope those (bus operators) who are in trouble would come and discuss with banking institutions or credit companies,\u201d he told reporters after officiating the Terengganu Bus Operators 2021 annual general meeting, here today.\n\nHe said of the 267 bus operators that had applied for restructuring, 195 were approved while the remaining 74 companies failed in their applications due to various factors such as high outstanding arrears.\n\nIn the meantime, Rosol said the bus operators\u2019 associations nationwide should play their roles in publicising the facility on restructuring installment payment so that more bus operators can enjoy the assistance provided by the government.\n\nHe said the government through other ministries also played their respective roles to help the group, among others through the Bus and Taxi Hire Purchase Rehabilitation Scheme, Perlindungan Ekonomi Dan Rakyat Malaysia (PERMAI), flexibility in borrowing conditions, 50 per cent exemption on all interest charges and payments as well as creating a Covid Mediation Centre (PMC).\n\nHe said the restructuring was also aimed at preventing their vehicles from being repossessed by banking institutions and credit companies when installment payments were not made. \u2013 Bernama", "keyword": ["apply", "restructuring", "rosol", "payment", "payments", "cent", "companies", "operators",

corporates and NGOs to encourage more Malaysians to sign up for the Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nScience, Technology and Innovation Minister Khairy Jamaluddin Abu Bakar (picture) said Pos Malaysia Bhd, Grab Malaysia, Parkson Corp Sdn Bhd, Living Minds Sdn Bhd and St John Ambulance of Malaysia (SJAM) will join forces with the government to raise awareness of the vaccine.\n\nKhairy, who is also the coordinating minister for the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme (PICK), said these partnerships are expected to increase the number of vaccine registrations for Covid-19 in the country.\n\n\u201cThe priority for all the partners is to utilise their ubiquitous presence by distributing flyers door-to-door in rural areas and states with low registration rates, whether through delivery, retail, the NGO sector or athletes who are also influencers.\n\n\u201cWe hope this effort will convince and influence more people in the country to register for the vaccination,\u201d he said in a virtual media briefing after launching the corporate collaboration for PICK yesterday.\n\nUnder the collaboration, he said Pos Malaysia will launch a special Covid-19 stamp edition to appreciate frontliners and a #BersamaMencegahCovid-19 campaign to boost vaccine registration.\n\nHe added that Pos Malaysia will also send flyers door-to-door, while delivering parcels to their customers.\n\n\u201cInformation posters on vaccination are also provided at post offices throughout Malaysia.\n\n\u201cIn the meantime, Pos Malaysia\u2019s social media platform will also be used to channel information on the immunisation programme to the public,\u201d he noted.\n\nThe minister also said he will be happy to consider the request from Pos Malaysia to categorise postmen as frontliners to be inoculated in the near future.\n\nMeanwhile, in collaboration with Grab Malaysia, Khairy said the e-hailing provider will display advertisements on their application, in which it will have a direct link to MySejahtera to facilitate people on the vaccine registration process.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, Grab will provide updated and accurate information about the vaccination programme via its application to users.\n\n\u201cWe are also planning to discuss further on how we can map out vaccination centres and ensure those with appointments can easily get e-hailing rides from their homes.\n\n\u201cWe hope that we can utilise a similar partnership that we had during the SEA Games previously to identify drop-off points for vaccination centres,\u201d he added.\n\nKhairy also noted that Grab drivers will be considered to be included in the upcoming phases of vaccination, which will involve economic frontliners.\n\nCommenting on local sports marketing company Living Minds, Khairy said the company has come forward to offer 12 professional football players under their management as vaccination ambassadors, as well as to help spread the message on vaccination through their social media platform.\n\nHe hoped that the message from top athletes and footballers will encourage people in the sports sector to get themselves inoculated in order to allow the industry to\n\noperate in full force again. Meanwhile, Parkson Corp has agreed to set up vaccination registration counters in 20 selected retail stores to assist people with the vaccine registration process.\n\nApart from corporate groups, SJAM will mobilise volunteers to publicise the vaccination programme, while assisting people on the registration through MySejahtera.\n\nThe minister said SJAM will also provide ambulance and medical teams at vaccination centres for emergency support.\n\nHe added that SJAM will also be doing blood donation drives in 50 locations nationwide from May 28 to May 30, and set up counters for volunteers to help the public with vaccine registration.\n\nAccording to Khairy, there are currently about seven million people who have registered for the vaccination programme in the country.\n\n\u201cI think it is a decent start.

Knowing the existence of bad hats and corrupt individuals, they are not sufficiently convinced to come forward to register.\n\n\u201cAt least, when agents were allowed to register on behalf of others, the risk was lower,\u201d he said.\n\nThirty thousand foreign workers have registered for the department\u2019s \u201crecalibration programme\u201d since it was launched last Nov 16 and MEF has said the figure represented only a little more than 2% of the estimated number of migrant workers.\n\nPereira said most foreign workers were aware they would have to face poor working conditions, be forced to live in horrible accommodation and receive low pay after being legalised.\n\n\u201cWe have created an artificial labour environment and we have ourselves to blame,\u201d he said.\n\nFormer human resources minister M Kula Segaran said bureaucratic procedures were to blame for the reluctance of employers or workers to sign up for the programme.\n\nHe said the online system was difficult to use and most applicants were being asked to go to Putrajaya to complete their registration.\n\nHe suggested that the process be decentralised to the district and state labour offices.\n\nKula also said all matters relating to foreign employment ought to be handled by the human resources ministry alone. Currently, some functions are handled by the home affairs ministry.\n\n\u201cAmong 64 countries with a similar labour system, Malaysia is the only country to have foreign employment matters overseen by the home ministry instead of human resource authorities.\n\n\u201cThe home ministry should focus on security.

growth since it debuted in May 2020\n\nBy LYDIA NATHAN / Pics courtesy of Snappea\n\nTHE concept of non-dairy milk is no longer new as it is a trending diet, with the dairy alternative market set to reach RM186.7 billion by 2027.\n\nIt\u2019s also interesting to note that 65% of people today have a reduced ability to digest lactose after the infancy stage.\n\nBranding itself as the first pea milk in Asia, Snappea hits the ground running, with consistent achievement of double-digit growth since it debuted in May 2020, as the popularity of plant-based milk has continued soaring not just in Malaysia, but globally as well.\n\nWith many arising concerns over the cruelty and lack of sustainability efforts of the dairy industry, more and more people have begun looking into alternatives on the shelves \u2014 vegans and non-vegans alike.\n\nSnappea founders Justin Chan and Phoebe Cheong said it was a timely launch despite being in the middle of the Movement Control Order last year. It was also launched on e-commerce platforms simultaneously.\n\nChan said the brand \u2014 which is certified halal by the Department of Islamic Development Malaysia \u2014 is currently one of the top three plant-based milks on Lazada, alongside two other international brands.\n\n\u201cSince we launched both in-store and online in less than 10 months, we have done well. We have successfully listed in more than 120 retail outlets, including big retail chains such as Jaya Grocer, Village Grocer, AEON, Ben\u2019s Independent Grocer, Lazada, Shopee and others.\n\n\u201cHowever, we believe we have barely 1% done in our mission to promote pea as one of the most sustainable food sources in the world,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve in an interview recently.\n\nSnappea is made with 100% non-genetically modified organism (GMO) Canadian peas, which is high in protein and has 0% cholesterol, and comes in three flavours: Utterly Original, Simply Unsweetened and Richly Chocolate.\n\nChan said the uniqueness of the milk is its taste and texture, as he noticed other plan-based milk had drawbacks of their own.\n\n\u201cWe noticed some plant-based milk had a watery consistency and a bland taste, nutritionally-inferior, especially for its low protein and low calcium contents.\n\n\u201cFor example, one cup of almond milk contains one gramme (1g) of protein. Besides that, there were also prevailing environmental concerns within the market surrounding unsustainable farming practices, excessive carbon footprint and high-water usage,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the company created something better using one of the most sustainable food sources in the world \u2014 peas.\n\n\u201cSnappea contains 10g of plant-based protein per cup, which is 10 times more than almond milk and 20% more than cow\u2019s milk. Each cup of Snappea also contains 170mg plant-based calcium,\u201d Chan noted.\n\nHe said Richly Chocolate has been the bestseller so far as it contains half the sugar of regular chocolate milk, but without any added preservatives.\n\nMeanwhile, Chan said sales are expected to be strong and the growth would continue in the next two to three years, as the brand has barely scratched the surface of the milk alternative market.\n\n\u201cMoving forward in 2021, we will be focusing on expanding our penetration locally in Malaysia and our neighbouring country, Singa- pore. As the first pea milk in Asia, there\u2019s a lot of awareness and education about peas that need to be done in the market,\u201d he said.\n\nThe brand will also look into having more retailers offer Snappea\u2019s products, in an aim to make it more accessible to a wider group of consumers.\n\n\u201cAnd of course, as a pea-focused company with a mission to educate about the sustainability and health benefits of peas, there are more pea-based products in the pipeline and we will definitely share more with our consumers when things get clearer,\u201d Chan said.", "keyword": ["momentum",

which IDEAS expects to increase by 58% this year.\n\n\u201cThis transparency is key to ensure accountability and efficient use of public funds,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nThe government also needs to ensure that the decisions made around the 665km project were based on achieving value for money and high-quality service delivery,\u201d and not subject to political agenda\u201d.\n\nTwo days

resulted in a reduction of RM21.5 billion and in significant realignments.\n\nAt the time, these renegotiations were initiated as a cost-saving exercise as 85% of the project costs were being funded through a loan from EXIM Bank which has a 3.25% interest rate and seven-year repayment moratorium.\n\n\u201cAlthough the transport minister has argued that the prior revised costs under the PH administration had excluded certain other expenditures, IDEAS stresses that the conflicting information coming out concerning the ECRL project points to the need for greater transparency.\u201d\n\nShe

corporates and NGOs to encourage more Malaysians to sign up for the Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nScience, Technology and Innovation Minister Khairy Jamaluddin Abu Bakar (picture) said Pos Malaysia Bhd, Grab Malaysia, Parkson Corp Sdn Bhd, Living Minds Sdn Bhd and St John Ambulance of Malaysia (SJAM) will join forces with the government to raise awareness of the vaccine.\n\nKhairy, who is also the coordinating minister for the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme (PICK), said these partnerships are expected to increase the number of vaccine registrations for Covid-19 in the country.\n\n\u201cThe priority for all the partners is to utilise their ubiquitous presence by distributing flyers door-to-door in rural areas and states with low registration rates, whether through delivery, retail, the NGO sector or athletes who are also influencers.\n\n\u201cWe hope this effort will convince and influence more people in the country to register for the vaccination,\u201d he said in a virtual media briefing after launching the corporate collaboration for PICK yesterday.\n\nUnder the collaboration, he said Pos Malaysia will launch a special Covid-19 stamp edition to appreciate frontliners and a #BersamaMencegahCovid-19 campaign to boost vaccine registration.\n\nHe added that Pos Malaysia will also send flyers door-to-door, while delivering parcels to their customers.\n\n\u201cInformation posters on vaccination are also provided at post offices throughout Malaysia.\n\n\u201cIn the meantime, Pos Malaysia\u2019s social media platform will also be used to channel information on the immunisation programme to the public,\u201d he noted.\n\nThe minister also said he will be happy to consider the request from Pos Malaysia to categorise postmen as frontliners to be inoculated in the near future.\n\nMeanwhile, in collaboration with Grab Malaysia, Khairy said the e-hailing provider will display advertisements on their application, in which it will have a direct link to MySejahtera to facilitate people on the vaccine registration process.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, Grab will provide updated and accurate information about the vaccination programme via its application to users.\n\n\u201cWe are also planning to discuss further on how we can map out vaccination centres and ensure those with appointments can easily get e-hailing rides from their homes.\n\n\u201cWe hope that we can utilise a similar partnership that we had during the SEA Games previously to identify drop-off points for vaccination centres,\u201d he added.\n\nKhairy also noted that Grab drivers will be considered to be included in the upcoming phases of vaccination, which will involve economic frontliners.\n\nCommenting on local sports marketing company Living Minds, Khairy said the company has come forward to offer 12 professional football players under their management as vaccination ambassadors, as well as to help spread the message on vaccination through their social media platform.\n\nHe hoped that the message from top athletes and footballers will encourage people in the sports sector to get themselves inoculated in order to allow the

growth since it debuted in May 2020\n\nBy LYDIA NATHAN / Pics courtesy of Snappea\n\nTHE concept of non-dairy milk is no longer new as it is a trending diet, with the dairy alternative market set to reach RM186.7 billion by 2027.\n\nIt\u2019s also interesting to note that 65% of people today have a reduced ability to digest lactose after the infancy stage.\n\nBranding itself as the first pea milk in Asia, Snappea hits the ground running, with consistent achievement of double-digit growth since it debuted in May 2020, as the popularity of plant-based milk has continued soaring not just in Malaysia, but globally as well.\n\nWith many arising concerns over the cruelty and lack of sustainability efforts of the dairy industry, more and more people have begun looking into alternatives on the shelves \u2014 vegans and non-vegans alike.\n\nSnappea founders Justin Chan and Phoebe Cheong said it was a timely launch despite being in the middle of the Movement Control Order last year. It was also launched on e-commerce platforms simultaneously.\n\nChan said the brand \u2014 which is certified halal by the Department of Islamic Development Malaysia \u2014 is currently one of the top three plant-based milks on Lazada, alongside two other international brands.\n\n\u201cSince we launched both in-store and online in less than 10 months, we have done well. We have successfully listed in more than 120 retail outlets, including big retail chains such as Jaya Grocer, Village Grocer, AEON, Ben\u2019s Independent Grocer, Lazada, Shopee and others.\n\n\u201cHowever, we believe we have barely 1% done in our mission to promote pea as one of the most sustainable food sources in the world,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve in an interview recently.\n\nSnappea is made with 100% non-genetically modified organism (GMO) Canadian peas, which is high in protein and has 0% cholesterol, and comes in three flavours: Utterly Original, Simply Unsweetened and Richly Chocolate.\n\nChan said the uniqueness of the milk is its taste and texture, as he noticed other plan-based milk had drawbacks of their own.\n\n\u201cWe noticed some plant-based milk had a watery consistency and a bland taste, nutritionally-inferior, especially for its low protein and low calcium contents.\n\n\u201cFor example, one cup of almond milk contains one gramme (1g) of protein. Besides that, there were also prevailing environmental concerns within the market surrounding unsustainable farming practices, excessive carbon footprint and high-water usage,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the company created something better using one of the most sustainable food sources in the world \u2014 peas.\n\n\u201cSnappea contains 10g of plant-based protein per cup, which is 10 times more than almond milk and 20% more than cow\u2019s milk. Each cup of Snappea also contains 170mg plant-based calcium,\u201d Chan noted.\n\nHe said Richly Chocolate has been the bestseller so far as it contains half the sugar of regular chocolate milk, but without any added preservatives.\n\nMeanwhile, Chan said sales are expected to be strong and the growth would continue in the next two to three years, as the brand has barely scratched the surface of the milk alternative market.\n\n\u201cMoving forward in 2021, we will be focusing on expanding our penetration locally in Malaysia and our neighbouring country, Singa- pore. As the first pea milk in Asia, there\u2019s a lot of awareness and education about peas that need to be done in the market,\u201d he said.\n\nThe brand will also look into having more retailers offer Snappea\u2019s products, in an aim to make it more accessible to a wider group of consumers.\n\n\u201cAnd of course, as a pea-focused company with a mission to educate about the sustainability and health benefits of peas, there are more pea-based products in the pipeline and we will definitely share more with our consumers when things get clearer,\u201d Chan said.", "keyword": ["momentum",

interest rate.\n\nIDEAS chief executive officer Tricia Yeoh said release of the details would allow the public to assess the project\u2019s financial feasibility and the implications for public debt, which IDEAS expects to increase by 58% this year.\n\n\u201cThis transparency is key to ensure accountability and efficient use of public funds,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nThe government also needs to ensure that the decisions made around the 665km project were based on achieving value for money and high-quality service delivery,\u201d and not subject to political agenda\u201d.\n\nTwo days ago, the transport ministry said the ECRL, which will now be known as ECRL 3.0, will revert to the northern alignment to connect Pahang and Selangor as previously planned by the Barisan Nasional administration.\n\nConstruction will take seven years and the ECRL will be operational in 2027.\n\nYeoh said that when the project was renegotiated by the previous Pakatan Harapan government, it had resulted in a reduction of RM21.5 billion and in significant realignments.\n\nAt the time, these renegotiations were initiated as a cost-saving exercise as 85% of the project costs were being funded through a loan from EXIM Bank which has a 3.25% interest rate and seven-year repayment moratorium.\n\n\u201cAlthough the transport minister has argued that the prior revised costs under the PH administration had excluded certain other expenditures, IDEAS stresses that the conflicting information coming out concerning the ECRL project points to the need for greater transparency.\u201d\n\nShe also said there was \u201ca serious lack of coordination\u201d between federal and state governments in the process.\n\nThis was based on Selangor state executive councillor Teng Chang Khim\u2019s

state government has completed the preliminary works required for land acquisition for the southern alignment under the \u201cECRL 2.0\u201d.\n\n\u201cSince these incurred costs are unrecoverable, the

corporates and NGOs to encourage more Malaysians to sign up for the Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nScience, Technology and Innovation Minister Khairy Jamaluddin Abu Bakar (picture) said Pos Malaysia Bhd, Grab Malaysia, Parkson Corp Sdn Bhd, Living Minds Sdn Bhd and St John Ambulance of Malaysia (SJAM) will join forces with the government to raise awareness of the vaccine.\n\nKhairy, who is also the coordinating minister for the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme (PICK), said these partnerships are expected to increase the number of vaccine registrations for Covid-19 in the country.\n\n\u201cThe priority for all the partners is to utilise their ubiquitous presence by distributing flyers door-to-door in rural areas and states with low registration rates, whether through delivery, retail, the NGO sector or athletes who are also influencers.\n\n\u201cWe hope this effort will convince and influence more people in the country to register for the vaccination,\u201d he said in a virtual media briefing after launching the corporate collaboration for PICK yesterday.\n\nUnder the collaboration, he said Pos Malaysia will launch a special Covid-19 stamp edition to appreciate frontliners and a #BersamaMencegahCovid-19 campaign to boost vaccine registration.\n\nHe added that Pos Malaysia will also send flyers door-to-door, while delivering parcels to their customers.\n\n\u201cInformation posters on vaccination are also provided at post offices throughout Malaysia.\n\n\u201cIn the meantime, Pos Malaysia\u2019s social media platform will also be used to channel information on the immunisation programme to the public,\u201d he noted.\n\nThe minister also said he will be happy to consider the request from Pos Malaysia to categorise postmen as frontliners to be inoculated in the near future.\n\nMeanwhile, in collaboration with Grab Malaysia, Khairy said the e-hailing provider will display advertisements on their application, in which it will have a direct link to MySejahtera to facilitate people on the vaccine registration process.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, Grab will provide updated and accurate information about the vaccination programme via its application to users.\n\n\u201cWe are also planning to discuss further on how we can map out vaccination centres and ensure those with appointments can easily get e-hailing rides from their homes.\n\n\u201cWe hope that we can utilise a similar partnership that we had during the SEA Games previously to identify drop-off points for vaccination centres,\u201d he added.\n\nKhairy also noted that Grab drivers will be considered to be included in the upcoming phases of vaccination, which will involve economic frontliners.\n\nCommenting on local sports marketing company Living Minds, Khairy said the company has come forward to offer 12 professional football players under their management as vaccination ambassadors, as well as to help spread the message on vaccination through their social media platform.\n\nHe hoped that the message from top athletes and footballers will encourage people in the sports sector to get themselves inoculated in order to allow the industry to\n\noperate in full force again. Meanwhile, Parkson Corp has agreed to set up vaccination registration counters in 20 selected retail stores to assist people with the vaccine registration process.\n\nApart from corporate groups, SJAM will mobilise volunteers to publicise the vaccination programme, while assisting people on the registration through MySejahtera.\n\nThe minister said SJAM will also provide ambulance and medical teams at vaccination centres for emergency support.\n\nHe added that SJAM will also be doing blood donation drives in 50 locations nationwide from May 28 to May 30, and set up counters for volunteers to help the public with vaccine registration.\n\nAccording to Khairy, there are currently about seven million people who have registered for the vaccination programme in the country.\n\n\u201cI think it is a decent start.

growth since it debuted in May 2020\n\nBy LYDIA NATHAN / Pics courtesy of Snappea\n\nTHE concept of non-dairy milk is no longer new as it is a trending diet, with the dairy alternative market set to reach RM186.7 billion by 2027.\n\nIt\u2019s also interesting to note that 65% of people today have a reduced ability to digest lactose after the infancy stage.\n\nBranding itself as the first pea milk in Asia, Snappea hits the ground running, with consistent achievement of double-digit growth since it debuted in May 2020, as the popularity of plant-based milk has continued soaring not just in Malaysia, but globally as well.\n\nWith many arising concerns over the cruelty and lack of sustainability efforts of the dairy industry, more and more people have begun looking into alternatives on the shelves \u2014 vegans and non-vegans alike.\n\nSnappea founders Justin Chan and Phoebe Cheong said it was a timely launch despite being in the middle of the Movement Control Order last year. It was also launched on e-commerce platforms simultaneously.\n\nChan said the brand \u2014 which is certified halal by the Department of Islamic Development Malaysia \u2014 is currently one of the top three plant-based milks on Lazada, alongside two other international brands.\n\n\u201cSince we launched both in-store and online in less than 10 months, we have done well. We have successfully listed in more than 120 retail outlets, including big retail chains such as Jaya Grocer, Village Grocer, AEON, Ben\u2019s Independent Grocer, Lazada, Shopee and others.\n\n\u201cHowever, we believe we have barely 1% done in our mission to promote pea as one of the most sustainable food sources in the world,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve in an interview recently.\n\nSnappea is made with 100% non-genetically modified organism (GMO) Canadian peas, which is high in protein and has 0% cholesterol, and comes in three flavours: Utterly Original, Simply Unsweetened and Richly Chocolate.\n\nChan said the uniqueness of the milk is its taste and texture, as he noticed other plan-based milk had drawbacks of their own.\n\n\u201cWe noticed some plant-based milk had a watery consistency and a bland taste, nutritionally-inferior, especially for its low protein and low calcium contents.\n\n\u201cFor example, one cup of almond milk contains one gramme (1g) of protein. Besides that, there were also prevailing environmental concerns within the market surrounding unsustainable farming practices, excessive carbon footprint and high-water usage,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the company created something better using one of the most sustainable food sources in the world \u2014 peas.\n\n\u201cSnappea contains 10g of plant-based protein per cup, which is 10 times more than almond milk and 20% more than cow\u2019s milk. Each cup of Snappea also contains 170mg plant-based calcium,\u201d Chan noted.\n\nHe said Richly Chocolate has been the bestseller so far as it contains half the sugar of regular chocolate milk, but without any added preservatives.\n\nMeanwhile, Chan said sales are expected to be strong and the growth would continue in the next two to three years, as the brand has barely scratched the surface of the milk alternative market.\n\n\u201cMoving forward in 2021, we will be focusing on expanding our penetration locally in Malaysia and our neighbouring country, Singa- pore. As the first pea milk in Asia, there\u2019s a lot of awareness and education about peas that need to be done in the market,\u201d he said.\n\nThe brand will also look into having more retailers offer Snappea\u2019s products, in an aim to make it more accessible to a wider group of consumers.\n\n\u201cAnd of course, as a pea-focused company with a mission to educate about the sustainability and health benefits of peas, there are more pea-based products in the pipeline and we will definitely share more with our consumers when things get clearer,\u201d Chan said.", "keyword": ["momentum",

resulted in a reduction of RM21.5 billion and in significant realignments.\n\nAt the time, these renegotiations were initiated as a cost-saving exercise as 85% of the project costs were being funded

the Covid-19 pandemic are urged to immediately apply for the restructuring of installment payments from banking institutions and credit companies.\n\nDomestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) Deputy Minister Datuk Rosol Wahid said since the Temporary Measures for Government Financing (Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19)) Bill 2020 to help those affected by Covid-19 was gazetted in December last year, only about 25 per cent or 267 bus operators had applied for the restructuring.\n\n\u201cThere are more than 1,000 bus operators nationwide but the number that have applied for the restructuring is less than 30 per cent. The results of an analysis found that as many as 75 per cent of bus operators have not made the application.\n\n\u201cThis number is quite low given the problems they face. So we hope those (bus operators) who are in trouble would come and discuss with banking institutions or credit companies,\u201d he told reporters after officiating the Terengganu Bus Operators 2021 annual general meeting, here today.\n\nHe said of the 267 bus operators that had applied for restructuring, 195 were approved while the remaining 74 companies failed in their applications due to various factors such as high outstanding arrears.\n\nIn the meantime, Rosol said the bus operators\u2019 associations nationwide should play their roles in publicising the facility on restructuring installment payment so that more bus operators can enjoy the assistance provided by the government.\n\nHe said the government through other ministries also played their respective roles to help the group, among others through the Bus and Taxi Hire Purchase Rehabilitation Scheme, Perlindungan Ekonomi Dan Rakyat Malaysia (PERMAI), flexibility in borrowing conditions, 50 per cent exemption on all interest charges and payments as well as creating a Covid Mediation Centre (PMC).\n\nHe said the restructuring was also aimed at preventing their vehicles from being repossessed by banking institutions and credit companies when installment payments were not made. \u2013 Bernama", "keyword": ["apply", "restructuring", "rosol", "payment", "payments", "cent", "companies", "operators",

corporates and NGOs to encourage more Malaysians to sign up for the Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nScience, Technology and Innovation Minister Khairy Jamaluddin Abu Bakar (picture) said Pos Malaysia Bhd, Grab Malaysia, Parkson Corp Sdn Bhd, Living Minds Sdn Bhd and St John Ambulance of Malaysia (SJAM) will join forces with the government to raise awareness of the vaccine.\n\nKhairy, who is also the coordinating minister for the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme (PICK), said these partnerships are expected to increase the number of vaccine registrations for Covid-19 in the country.\n\n\u201cThe priority for all the partners is to utilise their ubiquitous presence by distributing flyers door-to-door in rural areas and states with low registration rates, whether through delivery, retail, the NGO sector or athletes who are also influencers.\n\n\u201cWe hope this effort will convince and influence more people in the country to register for the vaccination,\u201d he said in a virtual media briefing after launching the corporate collaboration for PICK yesterday.\n\nUnder the collaboration, he said Pos Malaysia will launch a special Covid-19 stamp edition to appreciate frontliners and a #BersamaMencegahCovid-19 campaign to boost vaccine registration.\n\nHe added that Pos Malaysia will also send flyers door-to-door, while delivering parcels to their customers.\n\n\u201cInformation posters on vaccination are also provided at post offices throughout Malaysia.\n\n\u201cIn the meantime, Pos Malaysia\u2019s social media platform will also be used to channel information on the immunisation programme to the public,\u201d he noted.\n\nThe minister also said he will be happy to consider the request from Pos Malaysia to categorise postmen as frontliners to be inoculated in the near future.\n\nMeanwhile, in collaboration with Grab Malaysia, Khairy said the e-hailing provider will display advertisements on their application, in which it will have a direct link to MySejahtera to facilitate people on the vaccine registration process.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, Grab will provide updated and accurate information about the vaccination programme via its application to users.\n\n\u201cWe are also planning to discuss further on how we can map out vaccination centres and ensure those with appointments can easily get e-hailing rides from their homes.\n\n\u201cWe hope that we can utilise a similar partnership that we had during the SEA Games previously to identify drop-off points for vaccination centres,\u201d he added.\n\nKhairy also noted that Grab drivers will be considered to be included in the upcoming phases of vaccination, which will involve economic frontliners.\n\nCommenting on local sports marketing company Living Minds, Khairy said the company has come forward to offer 12 professional football players under their management as vaccination ambassadors, as well as to help spread the message on vaccination through their social media platform.\n\nHe hoped that the message from top athletes and footballers will encourage people in the sports sector to get themselves inoculated in order to allow the industry to\n\noperate in full force again. Meanwhile, Parkson Corp has agreed to set up vaccination registration counters in 20 selected retail stores to assist people with the vaccine registration process.\n\nApart from corporate groups, SJAM will mobilise volunteers to publicise the vaccination programme, while assisting people on the registration through MySejahtera.\n\nThe minister said SJAM will also provide ambulance and medical teams at vaccination centres for emergency support.\n\nHe added that SJAM will also be doing blood donation drives in 50 locations nationwide from May 28 to May 30, and set up counters for volunteers to help the public with vaccine registration.\n\nAccording to Khairy, there are currently about seven million people who have registered for the vaccination programme in the country.\n\n\u201cI think it is a decent start.

Knowing the existence of bad hats and corrupt individuals, they are not sufficiently convinced to come forward to register.\n\n\u201cAt least, when agents were allowed to register on behalf of others, the risk was lower,\u201d he said.\n\nThirty thousand foreign workers have registered for the department\u2019s \u201crecalibration programme\u201d since it was launched last Nov 16 and MEF has said the figure represented only a little more than 2% of the estimated number of migrant workers.\n\nPereira said most foreign workers were aware they would have to face poor working conditions, be forced to live in horrible accommodation and receive low pay after being legalised.\n\n\u201cWe have created an artificial labour environment and we have ourselves to blame,\u201d he said.\n\nFormer human resources minister M Kula Segaran said bureaucratic procedures were to blame for the reluctance of employers or workers to sign up for the programme.\n\nHe said the online system was difficult to use and most applicants were being asked to go to Putrajaya to complete their registration.\n\nHe suggested that the process be decentralised to the district and state labour offices.\n\nKula also said all matters relating to foreign employment ought to be handled by the human resources ministry alone. Currently, some functions are handled by the home affairs ministry.\n\n\u201cAmong 64 countries with a similar labour system, Malaysia is the only country to have foreign employment matters overseen by the home ministry instead of human resource authorities.\n\n\u201cThe home ministry should focus on security.

growth since it debuted in May 2020\n\nBy LYDIA NATHAN / Pics courtesy of Snappea\n\nTHE concept of non-dairy milk is no longer new as it is a trending diet, with the dairy alternative market set to reach RM186.7 billion by 2027.\n\nIt\u2019s also interesting to note that 65% of people today have a reduced ability to digest lactose after the infancy stage.\n\nBranding itself as the first pea milk in Asia, Snappea hits the ground running, with consistent achievement of double-digit growth since it debuted in May 2020, as the popularity of plant-based milk has continued soaring not just in Malaysia, but globally as well.\n\nWith many arising concerns over the cruelty and lack of sustainability efforts of the dairy industry, more and more people have begun looking into alternatives on the shelves \u2014 vegans and non-vegans alike.\n\nSnappea founders Justin Chan and Phoebe Cheong said it was a timely launch despite being in the middle of the Movement Control Order last year. It was also launched on e-commerce platforms simultaneously.\n\nChan said the brand \u2014 which is certified halal by the Department of Islamic Development Malaysia \u2014 is currently one of the top three plant-based milks on Lazada, alongside two other international brands.\n\n\u201cSince we launched both in-store and online in less than 10 months, we have done well. We have successfully listed in more than 120 retail outlets, including big retail chains such as Jaya Grocer, Village Grocer, AEON, Ben\u2019s Independent Grocer, Lazada, Shopee and others.\n\n\u201cHowever, we believe we have barely 1% done in our mission to promote pea as one of the most sustainable food sources in the world,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve in an interview recently.\n\nSnappea is made with 100% non-genetically modified organism (GMO) Canadian peas, which is high in protein and has 0% cholesterol, and comes in three flavours: Utterly Original, Simply Unsweetened and Richly Chocolate.\n\nChan said the uniqueness of the milk is its taste and texture, as he noticed other plan-based milk had drawbacks of their own.\n\n\u201cWe noticed some plant-based milk had a watery consistency and a bland taste, nutritionally-inferior, especially for its low protein and low calcium contents.\n\n\u201cFor example, one cup of almond milk contains one gramme (1g) of protein. Besides that, there were also prevailing environmental concerns within the market surrounding unsustainable farming practices, excessive carbon footprint and high-water usage,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the company created something better using one of the most sustainable food sources in the world \u2014 peas.\n\n\u201cSnappea contains 10g of plant-based protein per cup, which is 10 times more than almond milk and 20% more than cow\u2019s milk. Each cup of Snappea also contains 170mg plant-based calcium,\u201d Chan noted.\n\nHe said Richly Chocolate has been the bestseller so far as it contains half the sugar of regular chocolate milk, but without any added preservatives.\n\nMeanwhile, Chan said sales are expected to be strong and the growth would continue in the next two to three years, as the brand has barely scratched the surface of the milk alternative market.\n\n\u201cMoving forward in 2021, we will be focusing on expanding our penetration locally in Malaysia and our neighbouring country, Singa- pore. As the first pea milk in Asia, there\u2019s a lot of awareness and education about peas that need to be done in the market,\u201d he said.\n\nThe brand will also look into having more retailers offer Snappea\u2019s products, in an aim to make it more accessible to a wider group of consumers.\n\n\u201cAnd of course, as a pea-focused company with a mission to educate about the sustainability and health benefits of peas, there are more pea-based products in the pipeline and we will definitely share more with our consumers when things get clearer,\u201d Chan said.", "keyword": ["momentum",

which IDEAS expects to increase by 58% this year.\n\n\u201cThis transparency is key to ensure accountability and efficient use of public funds,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nThe government also needs to ensure that the decisions made around the 665km project were based on achieving value for money and high-quality service delivery,\u201d and not subject to political agenda\u201d.\n\nTwo days

resulted in a reduction of RM21.5 billion and in significant realignments.\n\nAt the time, these renegotiations were initiated as a cost-saving exercise as 85% of the project costs were being funded through a loan from EXIM Bank which has a 3.25% interest rate and seven-year repayment moratorium.\n\n\u201cAlthough the transport minister has argued that the prior revised costs under the PH administration had excluded certain other expenditures, IDEAS stresses that the conflicting information coming out concerning the ECRL project points to the need for greater transparency.\u201d\n\nShe

coordinating minister for the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme (PICK), said these partnerships are expected to increase the number of vaccine registrations for Covid-19 in the country.\n\n\u201cThe priority for all the partners is to utilise their ubiquitous presence by distributing flyers door-to-door in rural areas and states with low registration rates, whether through delivery, retail, the NGO sector or athletes who are also influencers.\n\n\u201cWe hope this effort will convince and influence more people in the country to register for the vaccination,\u201d he said in a virtual media briefing after launching the corporate collaboration for PICK yesterday.\n\nUnder the collaboration, he said Pos Malaysia will launch a special Covid-19 stamp edition to appreciate frontliners and a #BersamaMencegahCovid-19 campaign to boost vaccine registration.\n\nHe added that Pos Malaysia will also send flyers door-to-door, while delivering parcels to their customers.\n\n\u201cInformation posters on vaccination are also provided at post offices throughout Malaysia.\n\n\u201cIn the meantime, Pos Malaysia\u2019s social media platform will also be used to channel information on the immunisation programme to the public,\u201d he noted.\n\nThe minister also said he will be happy to consider the request from Pos Malaysia to categorise postmen as frontliners to be inoculated in the near future.\n\nMeanwhile, in collaboration with Grab Malaysia, Khairy said the e-hailing provider will display advertisements on their application, in which it will have a direct link to MySejahtera to facilitate people on the vaccine registration process.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, Grab will provide updated and accurate information about the vaccination programme via its application to users.\n\n\u201cWe are also planning to discuss further on how we can map out vaccination centres and ensure those with appointments can easily get e-hailing rides from their homes.\n\n\u201cWe hope that we can utilise a similar partnership that we had during the SEA Games previously to identify drop-off points for vaccination centres,\u201d he added.\n\nKhairy also noted that Grab drivers will be considered to be included in the upcoming phases of vaccination, which will involve economic frontliners.\n\nCommenting on local sports marketing company Living Minds, Khairy said the company has come forward to offer 12 professional football players under their management as vaccination ambassadors, as well as to help spread the message on vaccination through their social media platform.\n\nHe hoped that the message from top athletes and footballers will encourage people in the sports sector to get themselves inoculated in order to allow the industry to\n\noperate in full force again. Meanwhile, Parkson Corp has agreed to set up vaccination registration counters in 20 selected retail stores to assist people with the vaccine registration process.\n\nApart from corporate groups, SJAM will mobilise volunteers to publicise the vaccination programme, while assisting people on the registration through MySejahtera.\n\nThe minister said SJAM will also provide ambulance and medical teams at vaccination centres for emergency support.\n\nHe added that SJAM will also be doing blood donation drives in 50 locations nationwide from May 28 to May 30, and set up counters for volunteers to help the public with vaccine registration.\n\nAccording to Khairy, there are currently about seven million people who have registered for the vaccination programme in the country.\n\n\u201cI think it is a decent start. However, the preparations that we are doing now are in anticipation of a mass vaccination exercise that will take place from June onwards,\u201d he noted.\n\nRead our previous report here", "keyword": ["vaccination", "grab", "sjam", "khairy", "boost", "corporates", "help", "registrations", "registration", "covid19", "collaboration", "minister", "ngos", "programme", "vaccine"], "summary": "by S BIRRUNTHA / pic by RAZAK GHAZALITHE government is collaborating with corporates and NGOs to encourage more Malaysians to sign up for the Covid-19 vaccine.\nUnder the collaboration, he said Pos Malaysia will launch a special Covid-19 stamp edition to appreciate frontliners and a #BersamaMencegahCovid-19 campaign to boost vaccine registration.\n\u201cAdditionally, Grab will provide updated and accurate information about the vaccination programme via its application to users.\nMeanwhile, Parkson Corp has agreed to set up vaccination registration counters in 20 selected retail stores to assist people with the vaccine registration process.\nAccording to Khairy, there are currently about seven million people who have registered for the vaccination programme in the country.", "news": "The Malaysian Reserve", "date": "2021-04-01 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "M\u2019sians Mad At Blank Interstate Travel Permits Already Signed & Approved, Police Say They\u2019re Investigating", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVyYWt5YXRwb3N0LmNvbS9uZXdzL21hbGF5c2lhLzIwMjEvMDQvMDgvbXNpYW5zLW1hZC1hdC1ibGFuay1pbnRlcnN0YXRlLXRyYXZlbC1wZXJtaXRzLWFscmVhZHktc2lnbmVkLWFwcHJvdmVkLXBvbGljZS1zYXktdGhleXJlLWludmVzdGlnYXRpbmcv0gGhAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wNC8wOC9tc2lhbnMtbWFkLWF0LWJsYW5rLWludGVyc3RhdGUtdHJhdmVsLXBlcm1pdHMtYWxyZWFkeS1zaWduZWQtYXBwcm92ZWQtcG9saWNlLXNheS10aGV5cmUtaW52ZXN0aWdhdGluZy9hbXAv?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Kirat Kaur", "Maya Suraya", "Azizul Rahman Ismail"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/pre-approved-police-form-interstate-travel.jpg", "text": "Subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates.\n\nUnder the nationwide Movement Control Order (MCO), interstate travel is not allowed without police approval.

growth since it debuted in May 2020\n\nBy LYDIA NATHAN / Pics courtesy of Snappea\n\nTHE concept of non-dairy milk is no longer new as it is a trending diet, with the dairy alternative market set to reach RM186.7 billion by 2027.\n\nIt\u2019s also interesting to note that 65% of people today have a reduced ability to digest lactose after the infancy stage.\n\nBranding itself as the first pea milk in Asia, Snappea hits the ground running, with consistent achievement of double-digit growth since it debuted in May 2020, as the popularity of plant-based milk has continued soaring not just in Malaysia, but globally as well.\n\nWith many arising concerns over the cruelty and lack of sustainability efforts of the dairy industry, more and more people have begun looking into alternatives on the shelves \u2014 vegans and non-vegans alike.\n\nSnappea founders Justin Chan and Phoebe Cheong said it was a timely launch despite being in the middle of the Movement Control Order last year. It was also launched on e-commerce platforms simultaneously.\n\nChan said the brand \u2014 which is certified halal by the Department of Islamic Development Malaysia \u2014 is currently one of the top three plant-based milks on Lazada, alongside two other international brands.\n\n\u201cSince we launched both in-store and online in less than 10 months, we have done well. We have successfully listed in more than 120 retail outlets, including big retail chains such as Jaya Grocer, Village Grocer, AEON, Ben\u2019s Independent Grocer, Lazada, Shopee and others.\n\n\u201cHowever, we believe we have barely 1% done in our mission to promote pea as one of the most sustainable food sources in the world,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve in an interview recently.\n\nSnappea is made with 100% non-genetically modified organism (GMO) Canadian peas, which is high in protein and has 0% cholesterol, and comes in three flavours: Utterly Original, Simply Unsweetened and Richly Chocolate.\n\nChan said the uniqueness of the milk is its taste and texture, as he noticed other plan-based milk had drawbacks of their own.\n\n\u201cWe noticed some plant-based milk had a watery consistency and a bland taste, nutritionally-inferior, especially for its low protein and low calcium contents.\n\n\u201cFor example, one cup of almond milk contains one gramme (1g) of protein. Besides that, there were also prevailing environmental concerns within the market surrounding unsustainable farming practices, excessive carbon footprint and high-water usage,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the company created something better using one of the most sustainable food sources in the world \u2014 peas.\n\n\u201cSnappea contains 10g of plant-based protein per cup, which is 10 times more than almond milk and 20% more than cow\u2019s milk. Each cup of Snappea also contains 170mg plant-based calcium,\u201d Chan noted.\n\nHe said Richly Chocolate has been the bestseller so far as it contains half the sugar of regular chocolate milk, but without any added preservatives.\n\nMeanwhile, Chan said sales are expected to be strong and the growth would continue in the next two to three years, as the brand has barely scratched the surface of the milk alternative market.\n\n\u201cMoving forward in 2021, we will be focusing on expanding our penetration locally in Malaysia and our neighbouring country, Singa- pore. As the first pea milk in Asia, there\u2019s a lot of awareness and education about peas that need to be done in the market,\u201d he said.\n\nThe brand will also look into having more retailers offer Snappea\u2019s products, in an aim to make it more accessible to a wider group of consumers.\n\n\u201cAnd of course, as a pea-focused company with a mission to educate about the sustainability and health benefits of peas, there are more pea-based products in the pipeline and we will definitely share more with our consumers when things get clearer,\u201d Chan said.", "keyword": ["momentum",

interest rate.\n\nIDEAS chief executive officer Tricia Yeoh said release of the details would allow the public to assess the project\u2019s financial feasibility and the implications for public debt, which IDEAS expects to increase by 58% this year.\n\n\u201cThis transparency is key to ensure accountability and efficient use of public funds,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nThe government also needs to ensure that the decisions made around the 665km project were based on achieving value for money and high-quality service delivery,\u201d and not subject to political agenda\u201d.\n\nTwo days ago, the transport ministry said the ECRL, which will now be known as ECRL 3.0, will revert to the northern alignment to connect Pahang and Selangor as previously planned by the Barisan Nasional administration.\n\nConstruction will take seven years and the ECRL will be operational in 2027.\n\nYeoh said that when the project was renegotiated by the previous Pakatan Harapan government, it had resulted in a reduction of RM21.5 billion and in significant realignments.\n\nAt the time, these renegotiations were initiated as a cost-saving exercise as 85% of the project costs were being funded through a loan from EXIM Bank which has a 3.25% interest rate and seven-year repayment moratorium.\n\n\u201cAlthough the transport minister has argued that the prior revised costs under the PH administration had excluded certain other expenditures, IDEAS stresses that the conflicting information coming out concerning the ECRL project points to the need for greater transparency.\u201d\n\nShe also said there was \u201ca serious lack of coordination\u201d between federal and state governments in the process.\n\nThis was based on Selangor state executive councillor Teng Chang Khim\u2019s

state government has completed the preliminary works required for land acquisition for the southern alignment under the \u201cECRL 2.0\u201d.\n\n\u201cSince these incurred costs are unrecoverable, the

corporates and NGOs to encourage more Malaysians to sign up for the Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nScience, Technology and Innovation Minister Khairy Jamaluddin Abu Bakar (picture) said Pos Malaysia Bhd, Grab Malaysia, Parkson Corp Sdn Bhd, Living Minds Sdn Bhd and St John Ambulance of Malaysia (SJAM) will join forces with the government to raise awareness of the vaccine.\n\nKhairy, who is also the coordinating minister for the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme (PICK), said these partnerships are expected to increase the number of vaccine registrations for Covid-19 in the country.\n\n\u201cThe priority for all the partners is to utilise their ubiquitous presence by distributing flyers door-to-door in rural areas and states with low registration rates, whether through delivery, retail, the NGO sector or athletes who are also influencers.\n\n\u201cWe hope this effort will convince and influence more people in the country to register for the vaccination,\u201d he said in a virtual media briefing after launching the corporate collaboration for PICK yesterday.\n\nUnder the collaboration, he said Pos Malaysia will launch a special Covid-19 stamp edition to appreciate frontliners and a #BersamaMencegahCovid-19 campaign to boost vaccine registration.\n\nHe added that Pos Malaysia will also send flyers door-to-door, while delivering parcels to their customers.\n\n\u201cInformation posters on vaccination are also provided at post offices throughout Malaysia.\n\n\u201cIn the meantime, Pos Malaysia\u2019s social media platform will also be used to channel information on the immunisation programme to the public,\u201d he noted.\n\nThe minister also said he will be happy to consider the request from Pos Malaysia to categorise postmen as frontliners to be inoculated in the near future.\n\nMeanwhile, in collaboration with Grab Malaysia, Khairy said the e-hailing provider will display advertisements on their application, in which it will have a direct link to MySejahtera to facilitate people on the vaccine registration process.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, Grab will provide updated and accurate information about the vaccination programme via its application to users.\n\n\u201cWe are also planning to discuss further on how we can map out vaccination centres and ensure those with appointments can easily get e-hailing rides from their homes.\n\n\u201cWe hope that we can utilise a similar partnership that we had during the SEA Games previously to identify drop-off points for vaccination centres,\u201d he added.\n\nKhairy also noted that Grab drivers will be considered to be included in the upcoming phases of vaccination, which will involve economic frontliners.\n\nCommenting on local sports marketing company Living Minds, Khairy said the company has come forward to offer 12 professional football players under their management as vaccination ambassadors, as well as to help spread the message on vaccination through their social media platform.\n\nHe hoped that the message from top athletes and footballers will encourage people in the sports sector to get themselves inoculated in order to allow the industry to\n\noperate in full force again. Meanwhile, Parkson Corp has agreed to set up vaccination registration counters in 20 selected retail stores to assist people with the vaccine registration process.\n\nApart from corporate groups, SJAM will mobilise volunteers to publicise the vaccination programme, while assisting people on the registration through MySejahtera.\n\nThe minister said SJAM will also provide ambulance and medical teams at vaccination centres for emergency support.\n\nHe added that SJAM will also be doing blood donation drives in 50 locations nationwide from May 28 to May 30, and set up counters for volunteers to help the public with vaccine registration.\n\nAccording to Khairy, there are currently about seven million people who have registered for the vaccination programme in the country.\n\n\u201cI think it is a decent start.

growth since it debuted in May 2020\n\nBy LYDIA NATHAN / Pics courtesy of Snappea\n\nTHE concept of non-dairy milk is no longer new as it is a trending diet, with the dairy alternative market set to reach RM186.7 billion by 2027.\n\nIt\u2019s also interesting to note that 65% of people today have a reduced ability to digest lactose after the infancy stage.\n\nBranding itself as the first pea milk in Asia, Snappea hits the ground running, with consistent achievement of double-digit growth since it debuted in May 2020, as the popularity of plant-based milk has continued soaring not just in Malaysia, but globally as well.\n\nWith many arising concerns over the cruelty and lack of sustainability efforts of the dairy industry, more and more people have begun looking into alternatives on the shelves \u2014 vegans and non-vegans alike.\n\nSnappea founders Justin Chan and Phoebe Cheong said it was a timely launch despite being in the middle of the Movement Control Order last year. It was also launched on e-commerce platforms simultaneously.\n\nChan said the brand \u2014 which is certified halal by the Department of Islamic Development Malaysia \u2014 is currently one of the top three plant-based milks on Lazada, alongside two other international brands.\n\n\u201cSince we launched both in-store and online in less than 10 months, we have done well. We have successfully listed in more than 120 retail outlets, including big retail chains such as Jaya Grocer, Village Grocer, AEON, Ben\u2019s Independent Grocer, Lazada, Shopee and others.\n\n\u201cHowever, we believe we have barely 1% done in our mission to promote pea as one of the most sustainable food sources in the world,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve in an interview recently.\n\nSnappea is made with 100% non-genetically modified organism (GMO) Canadian peas, which is high in protein and has 0% cholesterol, and comes in three flavours: Utterly Original, Simply Unsweetened and Richly Chocolate.\n\nChan said the uniqueness of the milk is its taste and texture, as he noticed other plan-based milk had drawbacks of their own.\n\n\u201cWe noticed some plant-based milk had a watery consistency and a bland taste, nutritionally-inferior, especially for its low protein and low calcium contents.\n\n\u201cFor example, one cup of almond milk contains one gramme (1g) of protein. Besides that, there were also prevailing environmental concerns within the market surrounding unsustainable farming practices, excessive carbon footprint and high-water usage,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the company created something better using one of the most sustainable food sources in the world \u2014 peas.\n\n\u201cSnappea contains 10g of plant-based protein per cup, which is 10 times more than almond milk and 20% more than cow\u2019s milk. Each cup of Snappea also contains 170mg plant-based calcium,\u201d Chan noted.\n\nHe said Richly Chocolate has been the bestseller so far as it contains half the sugar of regular chocolate milk, but without any added preservatives.\n\nMeanwhile, Chan said sales are expected to be strong and the growth would continue in the next two to three years, as the brand has barely scratched the surface of the milk alternative market.\n\n\u201cMoving forward in 2021, we will be focusing on expanding our penetration locally in Malaysia and our neighbouring country, Singa- pore. As the first pea milk in Asia, there\u2019s a lot of awareness and education about peas that need to be done in the market,\u201d he said.\n\nThe brand will also look into having more retailers offer Snappea\u2019s products, in an aim to make it more accessible to a wider group of consumers.\n\n\u201cAnd of course, as a pea-focused company with a mission to educate about the sustainability and health benefits of peas, there are more pea-based products in the pipeline and we will definitely share more with our consumers when things get clearer,\u201d Chan said.", "keyword": ["momentum",

which IDEAS expects to increase by 58% this year.\n\n\u201cThis transparency is key to ensure accountability and efficient use of public funds,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nThe government also

resulted in a reduction of RM21.5 billion and in significant realignments.\n\nAt the time, these renegotiations were initiated as a cost-saving exercise as 85% of the project costs were being funded through a loan from EXIM Bank which has a 3.25% interest rate and seven-year repayment moratorium.\n\n\u201cAlthough the transport minister has argued that the prior revised costs under the PH administration had excluded certain other expenditures, IDEAS stresses that the conflicting information coming out concerning the ECRL project points to the need for greater transparency.\u201d\n\nShe also said there was \u201ca serious lack of coordination\u201d between federal and state governments in the process.\n\nThis was based on Selangor state executive councillor Teng Chang Khim\u2019s
