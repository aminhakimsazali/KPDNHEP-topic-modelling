According to The Grocer, the company \u2013 which sells bamboo-based toilet paper, kitchen roll, tissues and baby wipes across China, Europe, the Middle East and the United States \u2013 is working with KPMG on an IPO strategy and running a dual-track process, which includes plans to either float on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) (a sub-market of the London Stock Exchange designed to help smaller companies access capital from the public market) in 2022 or raise money in a private placing followed by a much bigger flotation on the main market a year or two later. Valuation expectations for the company stand between \u00a3150 million and \u00a3300 million for the former route, or between \u00a3300 million and \u00a3600 million for the latter. The ambitious plans would be a first for a crowdfunded business. Having grown rapidly over the past three years, Cheeky Panda sales leapt from \u00a3100,000 in 2017 to \u00a35.7 million last year, with a 200% jump in 2020. \u201cThe paper category has not been disrupted in decades,\u201d founder Chris Forbes told The Grocer. \u201cWe believe we can stand alone in the market against the big guys and become a mainstream player\u2026 We think we\u2019re being conservative with our forecasts.

Specifically, advertisements claimed that its anti-virus activewear had been sprayed with a substance (LJ Shield) which protected people against pathogens, with copy stating: \u201cCure for the Spread of Covid-19? Lorna Jane Thinks So.\u201d The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) initiated legal action over the claims, with a federal judge subsequently stating that the company had sought to \u201cexploit the fear and concern\u201d surrounding the pandemic, adding: \u201cLorna Jane sought to profit from the fear with concerns of the public in a way that involves unlawful conduct in contravention of the relevant provisions of the Australian consumer law. The behaviour of Lorna Jane can only be described as exploitative, predatory and potentially dangerous.\u201d In a statement, the company said that it had been let down by a trusted supplier. Company CEO Bill Clarkson expanded: \u201cA trusted supplier sold us a product that did not perform as promised. They led us to believe the technology behind LJ Shield was being sold elsewhere in Australia, the USA, China, and Taiwan and that it was both anti-bacterial and anti-viral. We believed we were passing on a benefit to our customers at no extra cost to them.\u201d The incident came to light in July 2020. Clarkson added: \u201cIn the last 12 months we have reviewed the fundamentals of the production and marketing areas of our business, created new management roles in both teams and have now introduced an improved product testing regime so this cannot happen again.\u201d (TL)\n\nUS court rejects pre-emptive colour suit against Deutsche Telekom \u2013 The US District Court for the Northern District of California has rejected a case filed by San Francisco-based tech company Splunk Inc over its trademark rights in a colour gradient that includes Deutsche Telekom\u2019s signature magenta colour. Splunk filed the pre-emptive lawsuit seeking declaration that its use of a coral, magenta and orange colour gradient did not infringe the German telecoms company\u2019s US trademark rights in the colour magenta after receiving a cease and desist letter stating that the business \u201creserves its right\u201d to sue under US law. Despite similar action between the companies in Germany, the US court held that Splunk had \u201cfailed to demonstrate a reasonable apprehension of being sued in the United States\u201d, going so far as to state that the facts were \u201ca country mile\u201d from those necessary to establish jurisdiction. Neither company is out of the woods just yet though, as the court permitted Splunk to file an amended complaint to address the jurisdiction issues.

This will be done via its new arm, the F&B division, launched today in a virtual media conference.\n\nIn light of the Covid-19 pandemic, MRCA immediate past president and chief of F&B division Datuk Seri Garry Chua highlighted that the F&B division will lobby the government for extension and improvement to the Covid-19 Act and to protect and preserve retail businesses affected by the various Movement Control Orders (MCOs), for fair charges by delivery platforms and anti-competitive behaviour, for dine-in for vaccinated patrons as soon as possible, for business recovery funding for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and for government-initiated mediation on outstanding rent issues between landlords and tenants during the MCO.\n\n\u201cMRCA\u2019s F&B members are expected to gain invaluable opportunities to raise business-related issues and gain unhindered access to first-hand information from the authorities that would greatly benefit their respective businesses by leveraging on cordial relationships with various government bodies relevant to F&B operations including the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP), Human Resources Development Fund (HRDF) and Pertubuhan Keselamatan Sosial (Perkeso),\u201d said Chua.\n\nMeanwhile, the new F&B division aims to represent the voice and plight of F&B retailers with six main objectives.\n\n\u201cThese include to form a body of retailers specialising in the F&B industry among MRCA members to assist and support each other in matters of business; to arrange training, programmes, social and business networking events for its members to encourage and foster collaboration, goodwill and better understanding; to equip its members with the right skills, information and training to expand and develop their businesses particularly in the F&B industry; to promote and advance the professional development of the F&B division in the retail chain business and franchise industry; to assist and support the association in achieving and/or attaining its objectives; and any other matters that are incidental or conducive,\u201d said Chua.\n\nAlso present at the virtual conference were Tourism, Arts and Culture Minister Datuk Seri Nancy Shukri, MRCA president Shirley Tay, MRCA vice president and deputy chief of F&B division Valerie Choo and MRCA F&B division treasurer Datuk Kenneth Soh.\n\n\u201cThis new division will be a concrete and formidable platform for MRCA members, not just to assist and support each other, but also to expand the business network to foster more collaboration, goodwill, and understanding. It will also benefit entrepreneurs in developing local businesses and attract more F&B brand participation, which will ultimately increase economic activities to ensure viable long-term benefits to stakeholders within the industry,\u201d said Nancy.\n\nShe added that the F&B division is timely right now and is in line with one of their strategies, which is to enhance demand sophistication by increasing tourist experiences that are unique, differentiated and memorable. Therefore, it is important to increase the value of services and goods provided to tourists.\n\nIn anticipation of a business rebound post-pandemic, the F&B division should organise relevant workshops and training to ensure its members are well prepared to adapt to the new consumer trend and behaviour in the future.\n\n\u201cWe will provide members with knowledge and techniques to improve their operational efficiency, as well as an opportunity for expansion through franchising.

Over the next two weeks, all staff required to work on-site at HEINEKEN Malaysia\u2019s Sungei Way Brewery in Petaling Jaya are scheduled to receive their second dose of the vaccine through the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme (PICK), the Public-Private Partnership Covid-19 Industry Immunisation Programme (PIKAS), or the AstraZeneca Voluntary Opt-in Programme.\n\nFor employees based outside of Kuala Lumpur and Selangor, the Company will secure their vaccination through the Selangor Covid-19 Vaccination Programme (SelVAX) designated panel clinics nationwide.\n\nRoland Bala, Managing Director of HEINEKEN Malaysia, commented: \u201cWe commend the Government on its efforts to accelerate vaccinations through various programmes. We are thankful for the efficient roll-out of PIKAS by Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which has enabled 100% of our brewery\u2019s essential workforce to receive their first dose of the vaccine last week. HEINEKEN Malaysia is committed to protecting the health and safety of our workers, getting our staff vaccinated is a big step towards ensuring we are well prepared to resume operations as soon as we can.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt HEINEKEN Malaysia, we have been implementing a rigorous process to proactively screen for and prevent the spread of Covid-19 at the workplace. Besides fully complying with all required SOPs by the Government, we test all on-site employees and contractors on a bi-weekly basis. Our operations are highly automated, thus requiring only a minimal number of workers to handle systems and machines on our a 23.72-acre site and allowing physical distancing of at least 10 metres between operators. With no\n\nvisitors allowed to our brewery and our office staff all working from home, we have effectively created a workplace bubble comprised of essential workers who are critical for production operations only. This method has ensured zero workplace clusters, so with the added protection of 100% vaccinations, we are confident that we can operate safely,\u201d Roland added.\n\nHEINEKEN Malaysia is continuing its efforts to engage the Government on allowing brewers to resume operations, albeit at a scaled down level if necessary. According to the Confederation of Malaysian Brewers Berhad (CMBB), the impact of shutting down brewers is estimated to be at least RM200 million per month. In 2020, brewers contributed more than RM2 billion in taxes to the Government. However, under the current situation, no revenue can be generated for the Government.\n\nRoland commented, \u201cWe are ready to support the Government on accelerating Malaysia\u2019s recovery. With the economy and livelihoods at stake, we are prepared to help lessen the burden and inject much needed income to support the Government\u2019s revenue collection. Our impact also goes beyond direct tax contributions but through the supply, distribution, and retail of our products through over 35,000 local businesses in Malaysia. In a time when businesses in the food and beverage industry are struggling to survive, it is crucial that we ensure uninterrupted supply of products to the market to prevent any sudden shortages.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the curtailing of distribution of products deemed as non-essential by the authorities mean that finished goods stored in external warehouse are not allowed to be delivered to replenish depleting stock levels at retail outlets which are allowed to open, including supermarkets, convenience stores, grocery shops, restaurants, and coffee shops. We recommend that the distribution of finished goods be allowed, especially when the taxes on such products have already been paid in full to the Government. With breweries unable to operate and distribution not allowed, the market is expected to be depleted of stocks in the next three weeks. We are concerned that consumers may turn to illicit products that may be harmful to health.

The ongoing pandemic has impacted the country\u2019s economy, overburdened the healthcare system and virtually made prisoners of its residents for months.\n\nWalk-ins are a successful way to increase vaccination rates, as seen from the \u201cJab first, register later\u201d initiative in Kapit, Sarawak in June and the United States\u2019 walk-in vaccinations in pharmacies in May. To date, Malaysia has one of the fastest vaccination rates in the world with 1.35 doses administered per 100 people.\n\nActivists and community leaders have lauded the walk-in programme and expect it to mainly benefit migrants who are in the country legally with valid work permits but could not register for a vaccine under MySejahtera for some reason or other.\n\nFilipino community leader Liezl (not her real name) is relieved to know walk-ins would begin soon in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor as many members of her community have not been able to get their vaccine due to passport issues.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good especially for those who have passports that have already expired and still waiting (to renew their passports) since last year, ever since the pandemic began,\u201d she said, adding it would also help some of her stateless members.\n\nBut the same cannot be said for irregular migrants who include the undocumented, those who were documented but became undocumented as well as migrants who work under someone else\u2019s work permit.\n\nPublic health experts and civil society officials are concerned that the walk-in programme may not work as well for them, saying most migrants are leery of stepping foot into a vaccination centre as they still fear arrest and detention despite assurances of safe passage.\n\nOn Sunday, coordinating minister for the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme (Pick) Khairy Jamaluddin Abu Bakar announced that the guidelines to administer vaccines for migrants and refugees have been approved.\n\nHe added most of the vaccinations would be handled by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to reassure the migrants.\n\nImmigration Department director-general Datuk Khairul Dzaimee Daud promised a safe passage for them, telling Bernama via WhatsApp that \u201cimmigration will not interfere in (the) vaccination programme for migrants nor station its officials near the Covid-19 vaccination sites\u201d.\n\nMERCY Malaysia president Datuk Dr Ahmad Faizal Perdaus said walk-in vaccinations would be an ideal solution for irregular migrants and refugees as long as the groups, agencies and people responsible for allowing them into the PPV (vaccination centre) and administering the vaccine adhere to the assurance given by the Immigration Department director-general.\n\nHowever, he said governmental policy did not always translate well to the people on the ground, who may end up preventing some migrants and refugees from walking in to get their vaccine.\n\n\u201cThe proof will be in the pudding. And it will be in the eating of the pudding. Unfortunately, until it actually happens, we have no way of verifying (it is safe for migrants),\u201d he said.\n\nWhile walk-in vaccinations can do wonders to increase vaccination rates, experts and activists say the government should also start reaching out to irregular migrants and refugees through other methods.\n\nCurrently, the government\u2019s outreach programmes for the bedridden, the disabled and those living in rural areas include door-to-door and drive-through vaccinations, as well as the use of community centres as PPV and mobile vaccination sites. Currently, these initiatives only serve Malaysians.\n\nDr Ahmad Faizal said the government should not wait to include irregular migrants and refugees in the outreach programmes scheduled for Phase 4 of PICK.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should wait until that long. Because migrants are a reservoir of the virus. To a lesser extent, the refugee community,\u201d he said.\n\nNon-Malaysians are overrepresented in total infections. For instance, about 20 percent of infections recorded so far in July comprised non-citizens despite them being around 10 percent of the population overall.\n\nThere were about 1.7 million foreign workers in Malaysia in 2020, according to the Ministry of Human Resources. The International Organisation for Migration estimated that there was an additional two to four million irregular migrants in 2018. As of June this year, there were more than 179,000 refugees in Malaysia, according to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR).\n\nFounder and director of Our Journey Sumitha Shaanthinni Kishna said options other than walk-in vaccinations are also needed as many migrant workers are unlikely to avail of the initiative. Her group plans to provide a mobile vaccination site for migrants as soon as the Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) approves it.\n\n\u201c(They won\u2019t go into) government premises. For undocumented migrants, past experience has shown that it is very difficult (for them) to walk into government premises. For example, hospitals. The fear is there still (of being reported to Immigration),\u201d she said.\n\nThere are early signs that the walk-in programme may yet succeed, however.\n\nWhile many irregular migrants and refugees may be leery of walk-in vaccinations, some are willing to risk it if it means getting the vaccine sooner rather than later.\n\nAn undocumented migrant from Indonesia, who asked to be identified only as Surya, said his painless experience with the AstraZeneca opt-in programme made him encourage others to get their shot as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cI told them they should go get the shot for themselves. If we get the vaccine, we won\u2019t be so afraid. Yes, life and death are up to God but we must make the effort to be safe,\u201d he said. -Bernama", "keyword": ["migrants", "efforts", "outreach", "vaccination", "walkin", "good", "vaccinations", "work", "community", "analysis", "vaccine", "irregular", "walkins", "refugees", "begin", "programme", "reach"], "summary": "Vaccinating the millions of irregular migrants in Malaysia remains part of the country\u2019s plan to gain control of Covid-19 within its borders.\nBut the same cannot be said for irregular migrants who include the undocumented, those who were documented but became undocumented as well as migrants who work under someone else\u2019s work permit.\nDr Ahmad Faizal said the government should not wait to include irregular migrants and refugees in the outreach programmes scheduled for Phase 4 of PICK.\nThe International Organisation for Migration estimated that there was an additional two to four million irregular migrants in 2018.\nThere are early signs that the walk-in programme may yet succeed, however.", "news": "The Sun Daily", "date": "2021-07-30 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Food basket programme has its limitations, acknowledges minister", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWJvcm5lb3Bvc3QuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvMTkvZm9vZC1iYXNrZXQtcHJvZ3JhbW1lLWhhcy1pdHMtbGltaXRhdGlvbnMtYWNrbm93bGVkZ2VzLW1pbmlzdGVyL9IBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2021/07/kpt-bp-180721-jl-YB-Nanta.jpg", "text": "KAPIT (July 19): Minister of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Dato Sri Alexander Nanta Linggi acknowledges the limitation in the food basket programme under the People\u2019s Wellbeing and Economic Recovery Package (Pemulih).\n\nTaking his Kapit constituency as an example, he said the allocated RM300,000 for the programme would not be able to accommodate all 15,000 households across the parliamentary area.\n\n\u201cUnder the food basket programme, every parliamentary constituency \u2013 regardless of it being undereither the ruling coalition, or the opposition \u2013 is given RM300,000.\n\n\u201cUnder Kapit, there are three DUN (State Legislative Assembly) constituencies: Pelagus, Katibas and Bukit Goram; for each DUN area, I allocate RM100,000 for their respective food baskets.

This means that the government would need more manpower and resources.\n\nTo help the government achieve this target and the country to achieve herd immunity, Columbia Asia Group has volunteered to open up vaccination centres (PPV).\n\nColumbia Asia has been proactive in registering its hospitals as vaccination centres as part of the PICK campaign. This was carried out via applications submitted to ProtectHealth Corporation Sdn Bhd (ProtectHealth), a wholly-owned non-profit subsidiary of ProtectHealth Malaysia, established under the MOH.\n\n\u201cOur hospital setup is relatively small compared to other hospitals. Nevertheless, we are determined to fight this pandemic together with the nation by helping the country to speed up the Covid-19 vaccination campaign,\u201d said Dr Sharonpal Singh, Columbia Asia Regional Emergency Services Coordinator.\n\n\u201cOur hospital team designed and constructed viable workflows and organised dedicated rooms and space so we can serve our duty as a PPV,\u201d\n\nCurrently, Columbia Asia is working with the MOH through its eight branches that are functioning as vaccination centres, namely Bintulu, Iskandar Puteri, Miri, Setapak, Puchong, Seremban, Taiping and Tebrau.\n\nSome 160 on-ground Columbia Asia hospital staff have been assigned to man these urgent vaccination exercises across Selangor, Johor, Negeri Sembilan, Perak, Sarawak and Kuala Lumpur.\n\nThe number of vaccines allocated for each hospital depends on available resources such as space and manpower. Collectively, the eight Columbia Asia hospitals are capable of vaccinating 600 people a day.\n\nIn order to expedite the vaccine rollout, Columbia Asia has been formed collaborations with corporations.\n\nFor example, in Bintulu, Columbia Asia Bintulu and Petronas worked together to set up an industrial vaccine centre at Kidurong Club in Bintulu. Some 5,000 employees who are attached to oil and gas companies based in Bintulu will be vaccinated here. It commenced operations on July 5 and offers both Covid-19 tests as well as vaccinations.\n\nOther than Bintulu, Columbia Asia Miri also joined forces with health care company Qualitas to vaccinate oil and gas employees at the Petronas Carigali office in Lutong, Miri.\n\nColumbia Asia Miri was also the first PPV in the Columbia Asia group of hospitals to commence operations when they started vaccinations on May 25.\n\nThe latest to participate in the vaccination campaign is Columbia Asia Taiping, which became the eighth hospital to offer vaccinations. This came as a huge relief to Taiping residents, who previously had to rely on just one PPV.\n\nMedical officers at each hospital are on site to perform pre-vaccination assessment. They also carry out post-vaccination observations with the help of nurses. If any side effects should occur within the observation time, patients will be treated accordingly.\n\nIf patents develop symptoms after they have gone home and need treatment afterwards, they can choose to go back to the same hospital, or visit the nearest medical facility.\n\nEveryone should do their part in the fight against Covid-19 by registering with MySejahtera to be vaccinated.\n\nOnce an appointment is made, check the location of the vaccination centre and the date of the appointment. The number and list of vaccines are based on allocated slots prepared by the district health office (PKD). Vaccination venues will depend on where vacinees live.\n\n\u201cWe hope the public will not walk in without a MySejahtera appointment or try to make an appointment directly with our hospitals. Our hospitals will contact you prior to your appointment,\u201d said Dr Sharonpal.\n\n\u201cWe do not procure the vaccines ourselves. The Malaysian government is procuring the vaccines from manufacturers and appointing third party organisations to manage the vaccine distribution.

Vaccination also protects us from requiring hospitalisation or contracting severe Covid-19,\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother benefit of vaccination is that it is more economical compared to the cost of quarantine, loss of income, and repeated testing.

financial results from Ping Petroleum Ltd and SilTerra Malaysia Sdn Bhd.\n\nGroup MD Tan Sri Syed Zainal Abidin Syed Mohamed Tahir (picture) said with the oil price currently hovering above US$70 (RM295) per barrel, coupled with its enlarged shareholding of 90% in Ping, he foresees a significant improvement in revenue and profit contribution from Ping moving forward.\n\n\u201cThere is opportunity to further improve Ping\u2019s production output by rejuvenating existing wells to monetise economically attractive reserves in the Anasuria Cluster.\n\n\u201cWe are also looking into acquiring additional late cycle producing target markets as the North Sea, Malaysia and within the region as well,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve.\n\nOn June 30, DNeX equity stake in Ping rose to 90%, following the completion of the acquisition for an additional 60% stake in the upstream oil and gas player, valued at US$78 million.\n\nDNeX recorded a total revenue of RM284.6 million for the cumulative 15-month period ended March 31, 2021.\n\nOf that, the information technology and e-services segment represented RM197.8 million or 69.5%, whereas the energy segment contributed the balance RM86.8 million or 30.5%.\n\nAs at Ping\u2019s latest financial year ended Dec 31, 2020 (FY20), Ping recorded a total profit after tax of RM9.3 million on the back of RM142.4 million in revenue.\n\nHe said Ping had managed to stay profitable and generated positive operating cashflows during the year.\n\n\u201cIn relation to SilTerra, given the bullish outlook for the semiconductor sector today, where demand firmly outstrips supply and is expected to persist up to 2024, we are confident our business in the semiconductor market will grow at a strong pace.\n\n\u201cThe growing adoption of technology such as the Internet of Things, 5G, artificial intelligence and electric vehicles will continue to drive up demand for chips,\u201d Syed Zainal Abidin noted.\n\nHe added that the group has received a three-year contract extension for the National Single Window for Trade Facilitation concession up until 2024 which will continue to provide positive earnings.\n\n\u201cIt is expected to be a key contributor to our financial performance in our trade facilitation segment moving forward, contributing a revenue of about RM100 million a year,\u201d he said.\n\nThe contract extension also serves as a testament to DNeX\u2019s strength and capabilities as a leading e-services provider in trade facilitation.\n\nDNeX will continue to pursue opportunities in digitalisation among the public and private sectors in the country, he added.\n\nDNeX has secured a three-year contract with further three-year option for extension to supply installation and maintenance support services of submarine cable communications with PT Infrastruktur Telekomunikasi Indonesia (TelkomInfra).\n\nUnder the agreement, TelkomInfra will pay a standby charge of 213 billion rupiah (RM63 million) over the initial three-year period, excluding daily rates applicable depending on the work scope.\n\n\u201cWith an assumption of 65% vessel utilisation rate in a year, estimated total revenue per year, including standby charge, is about 215 billion rupiah.\n\n\n\n\u201cThus, revenue for the initial three years of contract can reach up to RM186 million, and RM372 million with the additional three-year option,\u201d he added.\n\nOn DNeX plans to raise RM642 million, Syed Zainal Abidin said the duration of the timeframe for the implementation of this exercise hinges on the take-up rate of the group\u2019s placement shares.\n\nThe exercise may be implemented in multiple tranches within six months from the date of approval of Bursa Securities or any extended period as may be approved by Bursa Securities, he explained.\n\n\u201cThe reason we opt for private placement is because it allows DNeX to bring in strategic investors which we can leverage for their track record and capabilities, to add value to our business and fuel our future growth.

According to The Grocer, the company \u2013 which sells bamboo-based toilet paper, kitchen roll, tissues and baby wipes across China, Europe, the Middle East and the United States \u2013 is working with KPMG on an IPO strategy and running a dual-track process, which includes plans to either float on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) (a sub-market of the London Stock Exchange designed to help smaller companies access capital from the public market) in 2022 or raise money in a private placing followed by a much bigger flotation on the main market a year or two later. Valuation expectations for the company stand between \u00a3150 million and \u00a3300 million for the former route, or between \u00a3300 million and \u00a3600 million for the latter. The ambitious plans would be a first for a crowdfunded business. Having grown rapidly over the past three years, Cheeky Panda sales leapt from \u00a3100,000 in 2017 to \u00a35.7 million last year, with a 200% jump in 2020. \u201cThe paper category has not been disrupted in decades,\u201d founder Chris Forbes told The Grocer. \u201cWe believe we can stand alone in the market against the big guys and become a mainstream player\u2026 We think we\u2019re being conservative with our forecasts.

Specifically, advertisements claimed that its anti-virus activewear had been sprayed with a substance (LJ Shield) which protected people against pathogens, with copy stating: \u201cCure for the Spread of Covid-19? Lorna Jane Thinks So.\u201d The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) initiated legal action over the claims, with a federal judge subsequently stating that the company had sought to \u201cexploit the fear and concern\u201d surrounding the pandemic, adding: \u201cLorna Jane sought to profit from the fear with concerns of the public in a way that involves unlawful conduct in contravention of the relevant provisions of the Australian consumer law. The behaviour of Lorna Jane can only be described as exploitative, predatory and potentially dangerous.\u201d In a statement, the company said that it had been let down by a trusted supplier. Company CEO Bill Clarkson expanded: \u201cA trusted supplier sold us a product that did not perform as promised. They led us to believe the technology behind LJ Shield was being sold elsewhere in Australia, the USA, China, and Taiwan and that it was both anti-bacterial and anti-viral. We believed we were passing on a benefit to our customers at no extra cost to them.\u201d The incident came to light in July 2020. Clarkson added: \u201cIn the last 12 months we have reviewed the fundamentals of the production and marketing areas of our business, created new management roles in both teams and have now introduced an improved product testing regime so this cannot happen again.\u201d (TL)\n\nUS court rejects pre-emptive colour suit against Deutsche Telekom \u2013 The US District Court for the Northern District of California has rejected a case filed by San Francisco-based tech company Splunk Inc over its trademark rights in a colour gradient that includes Deutsche Telekom\u2019s signature magenta colour. Splunk filed the pre-emptive lawsuit seeking declaration that its use of a coral, magenta and orange colour gradient did not infringe the German telecoms company\u2019s US trademark rights in the colour magenta after receiving a cease and desist letter stating that the business \u201creserves its right\u201d to sue under US law. Despite similar action between the companies in Germany, the US court held that Splunk had \u201cfailed to demonstrate a reasonable apprehension of being sued in the United States\u201d, going so far as to state that the facts were \u201ca country mile\u201d from those necessary to establish jurisdiction. Neither company is out of the woods just yet though, as the court permitted Splunk to file an amended complaint to address the jurisdiction issues.

This will be done via its new arm, the F&B division, launched today in a virtual media conference.\n\nIn light of the Covid-19 pandemic, MRCA immediate past president and chief of F&B division Datuk Seri Garry Chua highlighted that the F&B division will lobby the government for extension and improvement to the Covid-19 Act and to protect and preserve retail businesses affected by the various Movement Control Orders (MCOs), for fair charges by delivery platforms and anti-competitive behaviour, for dine-in for vaccinated patrons as soon as possible, for business recovery funding for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and for government-initiated mediation on outstanding rent issues between landlords and tenants during the MCO.\n\n\u201cMRCA\u2019s F&B members are expected to gain invaluable opportunities to raise business-related issues and gain unhindered access to first-hand information from the authorities that would greatly benefit their respective businesses by leveraging on cordial relationships with various government bodies relevant to F&B operations including the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP), Human Resources Development Fund (HRDF) and Pertubuhan Keselamatan Sosial (Perkeso),\u201d said Chua.\n\nMeanwhile, the new F&B division aims to represent the voice and plight of F&B retailers with six main objectives.\n\n\u201cThese include to form a body of retailers specialising in the F&B industry among MRCA members to assist and support each other in matters of business; to arrange training, programmes, social and business networking events for its members to encourage and foster collaboration, goodwill and better understanding; to equip its members with the right skills, information and training to expand and develop their businesses particularly in the F&B industry; to promote and advance the professional development of the F&B division in the retail chain business and franchise industry; to assist and support the association in achieving and/or attaining its objectives; and any other matters that are incidental or conducive,\u201d said Chua.\n\nAlso present at the virtual conference were Tourism, Arts and Culture Minister Datuk Seri Nancy Shukri, MRCA president Shirley Tay, MRCA vice president and deputy chief of F&B division Valerie Choo and MRCA F&B division treasurer Datuk Kenneth Soh.\n\n\u201cThis new division will be a concrete and formidable platform for MRCA members, not just to assist and support each other, but also to expand the business network to foster more collaboration, goodwill, and understanding. It will also benefit entrepreneurs in developing local businesses and attract more F&B brand participation, which will ultimately increase economic activities to ensure viable long-term benefits to stakeholders within the industry,\u201d said Nancy.\n\nShe added that the F&B division is timely right now and is in line with one of their strategies, which is to enhance demand sophistication by increasing tourist experiences that are unique, differentiated and memorable. Therefore, it is important to increase the value of services and goods provided to tourists.\n\nIn anticipation of a business rebound post-pandemic, the F&B division should organise relevant workshops and training to ensure its members are well prepared to adapt to the new consumer trend and behaviour in the future.\n\n\u201cWe will provide members with knowledge and techniques to improve their operational efficiency, as well as an opportunity for expansion through franchising.

Over the next two weeks, all staff required to work on-site at HEINEKEN Malaysia\u2019s Sungei Way Brewery in Petaling Jaya are scheduled to receive their second dose of the vaccine through the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme (PICK), the Public-Private Partnership Covid-19 Industry Immunisation Programme (PIKAS), or the AstraZeneca Voluntary Opt-in Programme.\n\nFor employees based outside of Kuala Lumpur and Selangor, the Company will secure their vaccination through the Selangor Covid-19 Vaccination Programme (SelVAX) designated panel clinics nationwide.\n\nRoland Bala, Managing Director of HEINEKEN Malaysia, commented: \u201cWe commend the Government on its efforts to accelerate vaccinations through various programmes. We are thankful for the efficient roll-out of PIKAS by Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which has enabled 100% of our brewery\u2019s essential workforce to receive their first dose of the vaccine last week. HEINEKEN Malaysia is committed to protecting the health and safety of our workers, getting our staff vaccinated is a big step towards ensuring we are well prepared to resume operations as soon as we can.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt HEINEKEN Malaysia, we have been implementing a rigorous process to proactively screen for and prevent the spread of Covid-19 at the workplace. Besides fully complying with all required SOPs by the Government, we test all on-site employees and contractors on a bi-weekly basis. Our operations are highly automated, thus requiring only a minimal number of workers to handle systems and machines on our a 23.72-acre site and allowing physical distancing of at least 10 metres between operators. With no\n\nvisitors allowed to our brewery and our office staff all working from home, we have effectively created a workplace bubble comprised of essential workers who are critical for production operations only. This method has ensured zero workplace clusters, so with the added protection of 100% vaccinations, we are confident that we can operate safely,\u201d Roland added.\n\nHEINEKEN Malaysia is continuing its efforts to engage the Government on allowing brewers to resume operations, albeit at a scaled down level if necessary. According to the Confederation of Malaysian Brewers Berhad (CMBB), the impact of shutting down brewers is estimated to be at least RM200 million per month. In 2020, brewers contributed more than RM2 billion in taxes to the Government. However, under the current situation, no revenue can be generated for the Government.\n\nRoland commented, \u201cWe are ready to support the Government on accelerating Malaysia\u2019s recovery. With the economy and livelihoods at stake, we are prepared to help lessen the burden and inject much needed income to support the Government\u2019s revenue collection. Our impact also goes beyond direct tax contributions but through the supply, distribution, and retail of our products through over 35,000 local businesses in Malaysia. In a time when businesses in the food and beverage industry are struggling to survive, it is crucial that we ensure uninterrupted supply of products to the market to prevent any sudden shortages.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the curtailing of distribution of products deemed as non-essential by the authorities mean that finished goods stored in external warehouse are not allowed to be delivered to replenish depleting stock levels at retail outlets which are allowed to open, including supermarkets, convenience stores, grocery shops, restaurants, and coffee shops. We recommend that the distribution of finished goods be allowed, especially when the taxes on such products have already been paid in full to the Government. With breweries unable to operate and distribution not allowed, the market is expected to be depleted of stocks in the next three weeks.

The ongoing pandemic has impacted the country\u2019s economy, overburdened the healthcare system and virtually made prisoners of its residents for months.\n\nWalk-ins are a successful way to increase vaccination rates, as seen from the \u201cJab first, register later\u201d initiative in Kapit, Sarawak in June and the United States\u2019 walk-in vaccinations in pharmacies in May. To date, Malaysia has one of the fastest vaccination rates in the world with 1.35 doses administered per 100 people.\n\nActivists and community leaders have lauded the walk-in programme and expect it to mainly benefit migrants who are in the country legally with valid work permits but could not register for a vaccine under MySejahtera for some reason or other.\n\nFilipino community leader Liezl (not her real name) is relieved to know walk-ins would begin soon in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor as many members of her community have not been able to get their vaccine due to passport issues.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good especially for those who have passports that have already expired and still waiting (to renew their passports) since last year, ever since the pandemic began,\u201d she said, adding it would also help some of her stateless members.\n\nBut the same cannot be said for irregular migrants who include the undocumented, those who were documented but became undocumented as well as migrants who work under someone else\u2019s work permit.\n\nPublic health experts and civil society officials are concerned that the walk-in programme may not work as well for them, saying most migrants are leery of stepping foot into a vaccination centre as they still fear arrest and detention despite assurances of safe passage.\n\nOn Sunday, coordinating minister for the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme (Pick) Khairy Jamaluddin Abu Bakar announced that the guidelines to administer vaccines for migrants and refugees have been approved.\n\nHe added most of the vaccinations would be handled by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to reassure the migrants.\n\nImmigration Department director-general Datuk Khairul Dzaimee Daud promised a safe passage for them, telling Bernama via WhatsApp that \u201cimmigration will not interfere in (the) vaccination programme for migrants nor station its officials near the Covid-19 vaccination sites\u201d.\n\nMERCY Malaysia president Datuk Dr Ahmad Faizal Perdaus said walk-in vaccinations would be an ideal solution for irregular migrants and refugees as long as the groups, agencies and people responsible for allowing them into the PPV (vaccination centre) and administering the vaccine adhere to the assurance given by the Immigration Department director-general.\n\nHowever, he said governmental policy did not always translate well to the people on the ground, who may end up preventing some migrants and refugees from walking in to get their vaccine.\n\n\u201cThe proof will be in the pudding. And it will be in the eating of the pudding. Unfortunately, until it actually happens, we have no way of verifying (it is safe for migrants),\u201d he said.\n\nWhile walk-in vaccinations can do wonders to increase vaccination rates, experts and activists say the government should also start reaching out to irregular migrants and refugees through other methods.\n\nCurrently, the government\u2019s outreach programmes for the bedridden, the disabled and those living in rural areas include door-to-door and drive-through vaccinations, as well as the use of community centres as PPV and mobile vaccination sites. Currently, these initiatives only serve Malaysians.\n\nDr Ahmad Faizal said the government should not wait to include irregular migrants and refugees in the outreach programmes scheduled for Phase 4 of PICK.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should wait until that long. Because migrants are a reservoir of the virus. To a lesser extent, the refugee community,\u201d he said.\n\nNon-Malaysians are overrepresented in total infections. For instance, about 20 percent of infections recorded so far in July comprised non-citizens despite them being around 10 percent of the population overall.\n\nThere were about 1.7 million foreign workers in Malaysia in 2020, according to the Ministry of Human Resources. The International Organisation for Migration estimated that there was an additional two to four million irregular migrants in 2018. As of June this year, there were more than 179,000 refugees in Malaysia, according to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR).\n\nFounder and director of Our Journey Sumitha Shaanthinni Kishna said options other than walk-in vaccinations are also needed as many migrant workers are unlikely to avail of the initiative.

If we get the vaccine, we won\u2019t be so afraid.

This means that the government would need more manpower and resources.\n\nTo help the government achieve this target and the country to achieve herd immunity, Columbia Asia Group has volunteered to open up vaccination centres (PPV).\n\nColumbia Asia has been proactive in registering its hospitals as vaccination centres as part of the PICK campaign. This was carried out via applications submitted to ProtectHealth Corporation Sdn Bhd (ProtectHealth), a wholly-owned non-profit subsidiary of ProtectHealth Malaysia, established under the MOH.\n\n\u201cOur hospital setup is relatively small compared to other hospitals. Nevertheless, we are determined to fight this pandemic together with the nation by helping the country to speed up the Covid-19 vaccination campaign,\u201d said Dr Sharonpal Singh, Columbia Asia Regional Emergency Services Coordinator.\n\n\u201cOur hospital team designed and constructed viable workflows and organised dedicated rooms and space so we can serve our duty as a PPV,\u201d\n\nCurrently, Columbia Asia is working with the MOH through its eight branches that are functioning as vaccination centres, namely Bintulu, Iskandar Puteri, Miri, Setapak, Puchong, Seremban, Taiping and Tebrau.\n\nSome 160 on-ground Columbia Asia hospital staff have been assigned to man these urgent vaccination exercises across Selangor, Johor, Negeri Sembilan, Perak, Sarawak and Kuala Lumpur.\n\nThe number of vaccines allocated for each hospital depends on available resources such as space and manpower. Collectively, the eight Columbia Asia hospitals are capable of vaccinating 600 people a day.\n\nIn order to expedite the vaccine rollout, Columbia Asia has been formed collaborations with corporations.\n\nFor example, in Bintulu, Columbia Asia Bintulu and Petronas worked together to set up an industrial vaccine centre at Kidurong Club in Bintulu. Some 5,000 employees who are attached to oil and gas companies based in Bintulu will be vaccinated here. It commenced operations on July 5 and offers both Covid-19 tests as well as vaccinations.\n\nOther than Bintulu, Columbia Asia Miri also joined forces with health care company Qualitas to vaccinate oil and gas employees at the Petronas Carigali office in Lutong, Miri.\n\nColumbia Asia Miri was also the first PPV in the Columbia Asia group of hospitals to commence operations when they started vaccinations on May 25.\n\nThe latest to participate in the vaccination campaign is Columbia Asia Taiping, which became the eighth hospital to offer vaccinations. This came as a huge relief to Taiping residents, who previously had to rely on just one PPV.\n\nMedical officers at each hospital are on site to perform pre-vaccination assessment. They also carry out post-vaccination observations with the help of nurses. If any side effects should occur within the observation time, patients will be treated accordingly.\n\nIf patents develop symptoms after they have gone home and need treatment afterwards, they can choose to go back to the same hospital, or visit the nearest medical facility.\n\nEveryone should do their part in the fight against Covid-19 by registering with MySejahtera to be vaccinated.\n\nOnce an appointment is made, check the location of the vaccination centre and the date of the appointment. The number and list of vaccines are based on allocated slots prepared by the district health office (PKD). Vaccination venues will depend on where vacinees live.\n\n\u201cWe hope the public will not walk in without a MySejahtera appointment or try to make an appointment directly with our hospitals. Our hospitals will contact you prior to your appointment,\u201d said Dr Sharonpal.\n\n\u201cWe do not procure the vaccines ourselves. The Malaysian government is procuring the vaccines from manufacturers and appointing third party organisations to manage the vaccine distribution. The role of a PPV is entrusted upon us and we shall abide by its rules and regulations,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cFor those who have not registered, or are hesitant to take the vaccine, we urge you to register because unvaccinated individuals can serve as a reservoir for the virus to mutate,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cVaccination provides immunity and has been largely protecting us even against the newer variants. Vaccination also protects us from requiring hospitalisation or contracting severe Covid-19,\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother benefit of vaccination is that it is more economical compared to the cost of quarantine, loss of income, and repeated testing. Vaccination may be our best exit strategy of returning to normalcy, so we are determined to be part of this programme, regardless of challenges.\u201d\n\nTo know more about Columbia Asia\u2019s Covid-19 initiatives, log onto the Covid-19 information page on the Columbia Asia website.", "keyword": ["vaccination", "sites", "hospital", "bintulu", "vaccines", "assigned", "taiping", "hospitals", "columbia", "appointment", "covid19", "vaccine"], "summary": "The eight Columbia Asia vaccination centres are located in Bintulu, Iskandar Puteri, Miri, Setapak, Puchong, Seremban, Taiping and Tebrau.\nColumbia Asia has been proactive in registering its hospitals as vaccination centres as part of the PICK campaign.\nNevertheless, we are determined to fight this pandemic together with the nation by helping the country to speed up the Covid-19 vaccination campaign,\u201d said Dr Sharonpal Singh, Columbia Asia Regional Emergency Services Coordinator.\nFor example, in Bintulu, Columbia Asia Bintulu and Petronas worked together to set up an industrial vaccine centre at Kidurong Club in Bintulu.\nThe latest to participate in the vaccination campaign is Columbia Asia Taiping, which became the eighth hospital to offer vaccinations.", "news": "CodeBlue", "date": "2021-07-19 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Malaysia\u2019s economic fundamentals still strong, supported by stable capital market, liquidity", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVib3JuZW9wb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA3LzI4L21hbGF5c2lhcy1lY29ub21pYy1mdW5kYW1lbnRhbHMtc3RpbGwtc3Ryb25nLXN1cHBvcnRlZC1ieS1zdGFibGUtY2FwaXRhbC1tYXJrZXQtbGlxdWlkaXR5L9IBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2021/03/lead1-MALAYSIA-ECON-p1.jpg", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR, July 28 (Bernama) \u2014 Malaysia\u2019s economic fundamentals are still strong and its growth prospect for the medium term is still bright, supported by a stable capital market, while the financial sector has ample liquidity and capital buffer, said Finance Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz.\n\nHe said among the issues raised by the Members of Parliament during the Special Parliament Meeting were whether the investors\u2019 confidence was affected following the Covid-19 pandemic in the country.\n\n\u201cA brief answer, no.

The seizure, which took place over the weekend, involved a raid of three premises that sold various types of face mask. In this case, the suspected counterfeit goods are Neutrovis brand masks. \u201cWe believe that they are using the premises as a storage location and to carry out distribution activities of the seized face masks,\u201d a law enforcement spokesperson said, before confirming that the raid took place in cooperation with the trademark owner. \u201cThe Johor KPDNHEP will continue to work with trademark owners and other agencies in the effort to protect the rights of consumers and the intellectual property rights of the industry. Traders are also warned not to conduct transactions using fake trade descriptions or counterfeit goods because the Johor KPDNHEP is constantly monitoring and will take stern action against offenders.\u201d (TJL)\n\nEluceda completes \u00a31.1 million institutional fundraising \u2013 Authentication and detection solutions company Eluceda has completed a \u00a31.1 million institutional fundraising round.

(BD)\n\nEco-friendly Cheeky Panda breaks new ground for crowdfunds with \u00a3300 million IPO \u2013 Eco hygiene company The Cheeky Panda is lining up a whopping \u00a3300 million initial public offering (IPO) on London\u2019s junior market next year to capitalise on the demand for sustainable brands. According to The Grocer, the company \u2013 which sells bamboo-based toilet paper, kitchen roll, tissues and baby wipes across China, Europe, the Middle East and the United States \u2013 is working with KPMG on an IPO strategy and running a dual-track process, which includes plans to either float on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) (a sub-market of the London Stock Exchange designed to help smaller companies access capital from the public market) in 2022 or raise money in a private placing followed by a much bigger flotation on the main market a year or two later. Valuation expectations for the company stand between \u00a3150 million and \u00a3300 million for the former route, or between \u00a3300 million and \u00a3600 million for the latter. The ambitious plans would be a first for a crowdfunded business. Having grown rapidly over the past three years, Cheeky Panda sales leapt from \u00a3100,000 in 2017 to \u00a35.7 million last year, with a 200% jump in 2020. \u201cThe paper category has not been disrupted in decades,\u201d founder Chris Forbes told The Grocer. \u201cWe believe we can stand alone in the market against the big guys and become a mainstream player\u2026 We think we\u2019re being conservative with our forecasts. We\u2019re comfortable \u2013 because of the size of the category and where the consumer trends are \u2013 that we\u2019ll get to a market cap of \u00a31bn in five years.\u201d (VA)\n\nLegal radar:\n\nLorna Jane responds to fine for covid-19-related advertising claims \u2013 The Guardian reports that Lorna Jane, an activewear brand based in Australia, has been fined A$5 million for falsely claiming that items of its clothing range \u201celiminated\u201d and prevented the spread of covid-19. Specifically, advertisements claimed that its anti-virus activewear had been sprayed with a substance (LJ Shield) which protected people against pathogens, with copy stating: \u201cCure for the Spread of Covid-19? Lorna Jane Thinks So.\u201d The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) initiated legal action over the claims, with a federal judge subsequently stating that the company had sought to \u201cexploit the fear and concern\u201d surrounding the pandemic, adding: \u201cLorna Jane sought to profit from the fear with concerns of the public in a way that involves unlawful conduct in contravention of the relevant provisions of the Australian consumer law. The behaviour of Lorna Jane can only be described as exploitative, predatory and potentially dangerous.\u201d In a statement, the company said that it had been let down by a trusted supplier. Company CEO Bill Clarkson expanded: \u201cA trusted supplier sold us a product that did not perform as promised. They led us to believe the technology behind LJ Shield was being sold elsewhere in Australia, the USA, China, and Taiwan and that it was both anti-bacterial and anti-viral. We believed we were passing on a benefit to our customers at no extra cost to them.\u201d The incident came to light in July 2020. Clarkson added: \u201cIn the last 12 months we have reviewed the fundamentals of the production and marketing areas of our business, created new management roles in both teams and have now introduced an improved product testing regime so this cannot happen again.\u201d (TL)\n\nUS court rejects pre-emptive colour suit against Deutsche Telekom \u2013 The US District Court for the Northern District of California has rejected a case filed by San Francisco-based tech company Splunk Inc over its trademark rights in a colour gradient that includes Deutsche Telekom\u2019s signature magenta colour. Splunk filed the pre-emptive lawsuit seeking declaration that its use of a coral, magenta and orange colour gradient did not infringe the German telecoms company\u2019s US trademark rights in the colour magenta after receiving a cease and desist letter stating that the business \u201creserves its right\u201d to sue under US law. Despite similar action between the companies in Germany, the US court held that Splunk had \u201cfailed to demonstrate a reasonable apprehension of being sued in the United States\u201d, going so far as to state that the facts were \u201ca country mile\u201d from those necessary to establish jurisdiction. Neither company is out of the woods just yet though, as the court permitted Splunk to file an amended complaint to address the jurisdiction issues.

This will be done via its new arm, the F&B division, launched today in a virtual media conference.\n\nIn light of the Covid-19 pandemic, MRCA immediate past president and chief of F&B division Datuk Seri Garry Chua highlighted that the F&B division will lobby the government for extension and improvement to the Covid-19 Act and to protect and preserve retail businesses affected by the various Movement Control Orders (MCOs), for fair charges by delivery platforms and anti-competitive behaviour, for dine-in for vaccinated patrons as soon as possible, for business recovery funding for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and for government-initiated mediation on outstanding rent issues between landlords and tenants during the MCO.\n\n\u201cMRCA\u2019s F&B members are expected to gain invaluable opportunities to raise business-related issues and gain unhindered access to first-hand information from the authorities that would greatly benefit their respective businesses by leveraging on cordial relationships with various government bodies relevant to F&B operations including the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP), Human Resources Development Fund (HRDF) and Pertubuhan Keselamatan Sosial (Perkeso),\u201d said Chua.\n\nMeanwhile, the new F&B division aims to represent the voice and plight of F&B retailers with six main objectives.\n\n\u201cThese include to form a body of retailers specialising in the F&B industry among MRCA members to assist and support each other in matters of business; to arrange training, programmes, social and business networking events for its members to encourage and foster collaboration, goodwill and better understanding; to equip its members with the right skills, information and training to expand and develop their businesses particularly in the F&B industry; to promote and advance the professional development of the F&B division in the retail chain business and franchise industry; to assist and support the association in achieving and/or attaining its objectives; and any other matters that are incidental or conducive,\u201d said Chua.\n\nAlso present at the virtual conference were Tourism, Arts and Culture Minister Datuk Seri Nancy Shukri, MRCA president Shirley Tay, MRCA vice president and deputy chief of F&B division Valerie Choo and MRCA F&B division treasurer Datuk Kenneth Soh.\n\n\u201cThis new division will be a concrete and formidable platform for MRCA members, not just to assist and support each other, but also to expand the business network to foster more collaboration, goodwill, and understanding. It will also benefit entrepreneurs in developing local businesses and attract more F&B brand participation, which will ultimately increase economic activities to ensure viable long-term benefits to stakeholders within the industry,\u201d said Nancy.\n\nShe added that the F&B division is timely right now and is in line with one of their strategies, which is to enhance demand sophistication by increasing tourist experiences that are unique, differentiated and memorable. Therefore, it is important to increase the value of services and goods provided to tourists.\n\nIn anticipation of a business rebound post-pandemic, the F&B division should organise relevant workshops and training to ensure its members are well prepared to adapt to the new consumer trend and behaviour in the future.\n\n\u201cWe will provide members with knowledge and techniques to improve their operational efficiency, as well as an opportunity for expansion through franchising.

Over the next two weeks, all staff required to work on-site at HEINEKEN Malaysia\u2019s Sungei Way Brewery in Petaling Jaya are scheduled to receive their second dose of the vaccine through the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme (PICK), the Public-Private Partnership Covid-19 Industry Immunisation Programme (PIKAS), or the AstraZeneca Voluntary Opt-in Programme.\n\nFor employees based outside of Kuala Lumpur and Selangor, the Company will secure their vaccination through the Selangor Covid-19 Vaccination Programme (SelVAX) designated panel clinics nationwide.\n\nRoland Bala, Managing Director of HEINEKEN Malaysia, commented: \u201cWe commend the Government on its efforts to accelerate vaccinations through various programmes. We are thankful for the efficient roll-out of PIKAS by Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which has enabled 100% of our brewery\u2019s essential workforce to receive their first dose of the vaccine last week. HEINEKEN Malaysia is committed to protecting the health and safety of our workers, getting our staff vaccinated is a big step towards ensuring we are well prepared to resume operations as soon as we can.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt HEINEKEN Malaysia, we have been implementing a rigorous process to proactively screen for and prevent the spread of Covid-19 at the workplace. Besides fully complying with all required SOPs by the Government, we test all on-site employees and contractors on a bi-weekly basis. Our operations are highly automated, thus requiring only a minimal number of workers to handle systems and machines on our a 23.72-acre site and allowing physical distancing of at least 10 metres between operators. With no\n\nvisitors allowed to our brewery and our office staff all working from home, we have effectively created a workplace bubble comprised of essential workers who are critical for production operations only. This method has ensured zero workplace clusters, so with the added protection of 100% vaccinations, we are confident that we can operate safely,\u201d Roland added.\n\nHEINEKEN Malaysia is continuing its efforts to engage the Government on allowing brewers to resume operations, albeit at a scaled down level if necessary. According to the Confederation of Malaysian Brewers Berhad (CMBB), the impact of shutting down brewers is estimated to be at least RM200 million per month. In 2020, brewers contributed more than RM2 billion in taxes to the Government. However, under the current situation, no revenue can be generated for the Government.\n\nRoland commented, \u201cWe are ready to support the Government on accelerating Malaysia\u2019s recovery. With the economy and livelihoods at stake, we are prepared to help lessen the burden and inject much needed income to support the Government\u2019s revenue collection. Our impact also goes beyond direct tax contributions but through the supply, distribution, and retail of our products through over 35,000 local businesses in Malaysia. In a time when businesses in the food and beverage industry are struggling to survive, it is crucial that we ensure uninterrupted supply of products to the market to prevent any sudden shortages.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the curtailing of distribution of products deemed as non-essential by the authorities mean that finished goods stored in external warehouse are not allowed to be delivered to replenish depleting stock levels at retail outlets which are allowed to open, including supermarkets, convenience stores, grocery shops, restaurants, and coffee shops. We recommend that the distribution of finished goods be allowed, especially when the taxes on such products have already been paid in full to the Government. With breweries unable to operate and distribution not allowed, the market is expected to be depleted of stocks in the next three weeks. We are concerned that consumers may turn to illicit products that may be harmful to health.

The ongoing pandemic has impacted the country\u2019s economy, overburdened the healthcare system and virtually made prisoners of its residents for months.\n\nWalk-ins are a successful way to increase vaccination rates, as seen from the \u201cJab first, register later\u201d initiative in Kapit, Sarawak in June and the United States\u2019 walk-in vaccinations in pharmacies in May. To date, Malaysia has one of the fastest vaccination rates in the world with 1.35 doses administered per 100 people.\n\nActivists and community leaders have lauded the walk-in programme and expect it to mainly benefit migrants who are in the country legally with valid work permits but could not register for a vaccine under MySejahtera for some reason or other.\n\nFilipino community leader Liezl (not her real name) is relieved to know walk-ins would begin soon in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor as many members of her community have not been able to get their vaccine due to passport issues.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good especially for those who have passports that have already expired and still waiting (to renew their passports) since last year, ever since the pandemic began,\u201d she said, adding it would also help some of her stateless members.\n\nBut the same cannot be said for irregular migrants who include the undocumented, those who were documented but became undocumented as well as migrants who work under someone else\u2019s work permit.\n\nPublic health experts and civil society officials are concerned that the walk-in programme may not work as well for them, saying most migrants are leery of stepping foot into a vaccination centre as they still fear arrest and detention despite assurances of safe passage.\n\nOn Sunday, coordinating minister for the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme (Pick) Khairy Jamaluddin Abu Bakar announced that the guidelines to administer vaccines for migrants and refugees have been approved.\n\nHe added most of the vaccinations would be handled by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to reassure the migrants.\n\nImmigration Department director-general Datuk Khairul Dzaimee Daud promised a safe passage for them, telling Bernama via WhatsApp that \u201cimmigration will not interfere in (the) vaccination programme for migrants nor station its officials near the Covid-19 vaccination sites\u201d.\n\nMERCY Malaysia president Datuk Dr Ahmad Faizal Perdaus said walk-in vaccinations would be an ideal solution for irregular migrants and refugees as long as the groups, agencies and people responsible for allowing them into the PPV (vaccination centre) and administering the vaccine adhere to the assurance given by the Immigration Department director-general.\n\nHowever, he said governmental policy did not always translate well to the people on the ground, who may end up preventing some migrants and refugees from walking in to get their vaccine.\n\n\u201cThe proof will be in the pudding. And it will be in the eating of the pudding. Unfortunately, until it actually happens, we have no way of verifying (it is safe for migrants),\u201d he said.\n\nWhile walk-in vaccinations can do wonders to increase vaccination rates, experts and activists say the government should also start reaching out to irregular migrants and refugees through other methods.\n\nCurrently, the government\u2019s outreach programmes for the bedridden, the disabled and those living in rural areas include door-to-door and drive-through vaccinations, as well as the use of community centres as PPV and mobile vaccination sites. Currently, these initiatives only serve Malaysians.\n\nDr Ahmad Faizal said the government should not wait to include irregular migrants and refugees in the outreach programmes scheduled for Phase 4 of PICK.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should wait until that long. Because migrants are a reservoir of the virus. To a lesser extent, the refugee community,\u201d he said.\n\nNon-Malaysians are overrepresented in total infections. For instance, about 20 percent of infections recorded so far in July comprised non-citizens despite them being around 10 percent of the population overall.\n\nThere were about 1.7 million foreign workers in Malaysia in 2020, according to the Ministry of Human Resources. The International Organisation for Migration estimated that there was an additional two to four million irregular migrants in 2018. As of June this year, there were more than 179,000 refugees in Malaysia, according to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR).\n\nFounder and director of Our Journey Sumitha Shaanthinni Kishna said options other than walk-in vaccinations are also needed as many migrant workers are unlikely to avail of the initiative. Her group plans to provide a mobile vaccination site for migrants as soon as the Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) approves it.\n\n\u201c(They won\u2019t go into) government premises. For undocumented migrants, past experience has shown that it is very difficult (for them) to walk into government premises. For example, hospitals. The fear is there still (of being reported to Immigration),\u201d she said.\n\nThere are early signs that the walk-in programme may yet succeed, however.\n\nWhile many irregular migrants and refugees may be leery of walk-in vaccinations, some are willing to risk it if it means getting the vaccine sooner rather than later.\n\nAn undocumented migrant from Indonesia, who asked to be identified only as Surya, said his painless experience with the AstraZeneca opt-in programme made him encourage others to get their shot as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cI told them they should go get the shot for themselves. If we get the vaccine, we won\u2019t be so afraid. Yes, life and death are up to God but we must make the effort to be safe,\u201d he said. -Bernama", "keyword": ["migrants", "efforts", "outreach", "vaccination", "walkin", "good", "vaccinations", "work", "community", "analysis", "vaccine", "irregular", "walkins", "refugees", "begin", "programme", "reach"], "summary": "Vaccinating the millions of irregular migrants in Malaysia remains part of the country\u2019s plan to gain control of Covid-19 within its borders.\nBut the same cannot be said for irregular migrants who include the undocumented, those who were documented but became undocumented as well as migrants who work under someone else\u2019s work permit.\nDr Ahmad Faizal said the government should not wait to include irregular migrants and refugees in the outreach programmes scheduled for Phase 4 of PICK.\nThe International Organisation for Migration estimated that there was an additional two to four million irregular migrants in 2018.\nThere are early signs that the walk-in programme may yet succeed, however.", "news": "The Sun Daily", "date": "2021-07-30 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Food basket programme has its limitations, acknowledges minister", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWJvcm5lb3Bvc3QuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvMTkvZm9vZC1iYXNrZXQtcHJvZ3JhbW1lLWhhcy1pdHMtbGltaXRhdGlvbnMtYWNrbm93bGVkZ2VzLW1pbmlzdGVyL9IBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2021/07/kpt-bp-180721-jl-YB-Nanta.jpg", "text": "KAPIT (July 19): Minister of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Dato Sri Alexander Nanta Linggi acknowledges the limitation in the food basket programme under the People\u2019s Wellbeing and Economic Recovery Package (Pemulih).\n\nTaking his Kapit constituency as an example, he said the allocated RM300,000 for the programme would not be able to accommodate all 15,000 households across the parliamentary area.\n\n\u201cUnder the food basket programme, every parliamentary constituency \u2013 regardless of it being undereither the ruling coalition, or the opposition \u2013 is given RM300,000.\n\n\u201cUnder Kapit, there are three DUN (State Legislative Assembly) constituencies: Pelagus, Katibas and Bukit Goram; for each DUN area, I allocate RM100,000 for their respective food baskets.

This means that the government would need more manpower and resources.\n\nTo help the government achieve this target and the country to achieve herd immunity, Columbia Asia Group has volunteered to open up vaccination centres (PPV).\n\nColumbia Asia has been proactive in registering its hospitals as vaccination centres as part of the PICK campaign. This was carried out via applications submitted to ProtectHealth Corporation Sdn Bhd (ProtectHealth), a wholly-owned non-profit subsidiary of ProtectHealth Malaysia, established under the MOH.\n\n\u201cOur hospital setup is relatively small compared to other hospitals. Nevertheless, we are determined to fight this pandemic together with the nation by helping the country to speed up the Covid-19 vaccination campaign,\u201d said Dr Sharonpal Singh, Columbia Asia Regional Emergency Services Coordinator.\n\n\u201cOur hospital team designed and constructed viable workflows and organised dedicated rooms and space so we can serve our duty as a PPV,\u201d\n\nCurrently, Columbia Asia is working with the MOH through its eight branches that are functioning as vaccination centres, namely Bintulu, Iskandar Puteri, Miri, Setapak, Puchong, Seremban, Taiping and Tebrau.\n\nSome 160 on-ground Columbia Asia hospital staff have been assigned to man these urgent vaccination exercises across Selangor, Johor, Negeri Sembilan, Perak, Sarawak and Kuala Lumpur.\n\nThe number of vaccines allocated for each hospital depends on available resources such as space and manpower. Collectively, the eight Columbia Asia hospitals are capable of vaccinating 600 people a day.\n\nIn order to expedite the vaccine rollout, Columbia Asia has been formed collaborations with corporations.\n\nFor example, in Bintulu, Columbia Asia Bintulu and Petronas worked together to set up an industrial vaccine centre at Kidurong Club in Bintulu. Some 5,000 employees who are attached to oil and gas companies based in Bintulu will be vaccinated here. It commenced operations on July 5 and offers both Covid-19 tests as well as vaccinations.\n\nOther than Bintulu, Columbia Asia Miri also joined forces with health care company Qualitas to vaccinate oil and gas employees at the Petronas Carigali office in Lutong, Miri.\n\nColumbia Asia Miri was also the first PPV in the Columbia Asia group of hospitals to commence operations when they started vaccinations on May 25.\n\nThe latest to participate in the vaccination campaign is Columbia Asia Taiping, which became the eighth hospital to offer vaccinations. This came as a huge relief to Taiping residents, who previously had to rely on just one PPV.\n\nMedical officers at each hospital are on site to perform pre-vaccination assessment. They also carry out post-vaccination observations with the help of nurses. If any side effects should occur within the observation time, patients will be treated accordingly.\n\nIf patents develop symptoms after they have gone home and need treatment afterwards, they can choose to go back to the same hospital, or visit the nearest medical facility.\n\nEveryone should do their part in the fight against Covid-19 by registering with MySejahtera to be vaccinated.\n\nOnce an appointment is made, check the location of the vaccination centre and the date of the appointment. The number and list of vaccines are based on allocated slots prepared by the district health office (PKD). Vaccination venues will depend on where vacinees live.\n\n\u201cWe hope the public will not walk in without a MySejahtera appointment or try to make an appointment directly with our hospitals. Our hospitals will contact you prior to your appointment,\u201d said Dr Sharonpal.\n\n\u201cWe do not procure the vaccines ourselves.

Vaccination also protects us from requiring hospitalisation or contracting severe Covid-19,\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother benefit of vaccination is that it is more economical compared to the cost of quarantine, loss of income, and repeated testing.

financial results from Ping Petroleum Ltd and SilTerra Malaysia Sdn Bhd.\n\nGroup MD Tan Sri Syed Zainal Abidin Syed Mohamed Tahir (picture) said with the oil price currently hovering above US$70 (RM295) per barrel, coupled with its enlarged shareholding of 90% in Ping, he foresees a significant improvement in revenue and profit contribution from Ping moving forward.\n\n\u201cThere is opportunity to further improve Ping\u2019s production output by rejuvenating existing wells to monetise economically attractive reserves in the Anasuria Cluster.\n\n\u201cWe are also looking into acquiring additional late cycle producing target markets as the North Sea, Malaysia and within the region as well,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve.\n\nOn June 30, DNeX equity stake in Ping rose to 90%, following the completion of the acquisition for an additional 60% stake in the upstream oil and gas player, valued at US$78 million.\n\nDNeX recorded a total revenue of RM284.6 million for the cumulative 15-month period ended March 31, 2021.\n\nOf that, the information technology and e-services segment represented RM197.8 million or 69.5%, whereas the energy segment contributed the balance RM86.8 million or 30.5%.\n\nAs at Ping\u2019s latest financial year ended Dec 31, 2020 (FY20), Ping recorded a total profit after tax of RM9.3 million on the back of RM142.4 million in revenue.\n\nHe said Ping had managed to stay profitable and generated positive operating cashflows during the year.\n\n\u201cIn relation to SilTerra, given the bullish outlook for the semiconductor sector today, where demand firmly outstrips supply and is expected to persist up to 2024, we are confident our business in the semiconductor market will grow at a strong pace.\n\n\u201cThe growing adoption of technology such as the Internet of Things, 5G, artificial intelligence and electric vehicles will continue to drive up demand for chips,\u201d Syed Zainal Abidin noted.\n\nHe added that the group has received a three-year contract extension for the National Single Window for Trade Facilitation concession up until 2024 which will continue to provide positive earnings.\n\n\u201cIt is expected to be a key contributor to our financial performance in our trade facilitation segment moving forward, contributing a revenue of about RM100 million a year,\u201d he said.\n\nThe contract extension also serves as a testament to DNeX\u2019s strength and capabilities as a leading e-services provider in trade facilitation.\n\nDNeX will continue to pursue opportunities in digitalisation among the public and private sectors in the country, he added.\n\nDNeX has secured a three-year contract with further three-year option for extension to supply installation and maintenance support services of submarine cable communications with PT Infrastruktur Telekomunikasi Indonesia (TelkomInfra).\n\nUnder the agreement, TelkomInfra will pay a standby charge of 213 billion rupiah (RM63 million) over the initial three-year period, excluding daily rates applicable depending on the work scope.\n\n\u201cWith an assumption of 65% vessel utilisation rate in a year, estimated total revenue per year, including standby charge, is about 215 billion rupiah.\n\n\n\n\u201cThus, revenue for the initial three years of contract can reach up to RM186 million, and RM372 million with the additional three-year option,\u201d he added.\n\nOn DNeX plans to raise RM642 million, Syed Zainal Abidin said the duration of the timeframe for the implementation of this exercise hinges on the take-up rate of the group\u2019s placement shares.\n\nThe exercise may be implemented in multiple tranches within six months from the date of approval of Bursa Securities or any extended period as may be approved by Bursa Securities, he explained.\n\n\u201cThe reason we opt for private placement is because it allows DNeX to bring in strategic investors which we can leverage for their track record and capabilities, to add value to our business and fuel our future growth.

According to The Grocer, the company \u2013 which sells bamboo-based toilet paper, kitchen roll, tissues and baby wipes across China, Europe, the Middle East and the United States \u2013 is working with KPMG on an IPO strategy and running a dual-track process, which includes plans to either float on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) (a sub-market of the London Stock Exchange designed to help smaller companies access capital from the public market) in 2022 or raise money in a private placing followed by a much bigger flotation on the main market a year or two later. Valuation expectations for the company stand between \u00a3150 million and \u00a3300 million for the former route, or between \u00a3300 million and \u00a3600 million for the latter. The ambitious plans would be a first for a crowdfunded business. Having grown rapidly over the past three years, Cheeky Panda sales leapt from \u00a3100,000 in 2017 to \u00a35.7 million last year, with a 200% jump in 2020. \u201cThe paper category has not been disrupted in decades,\u201d founder Chris Forbes told The Grocer. \u201cWe believe we can stand alone in the market against the big guys and become a mainstream player\u2026 We think we\u2019re being conservative with our forecasts.

Specifically, advertisements claimed that its anti-virus activewear had been sprayed with a substance (LJ Shield) which protected people against pathogens, with copy stating: \u201cCure for the Spread of Covid-19? Lorna Jane Thinks So.\u201d The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) initiated legal action over the claims, with a federal judge subsequently stating that the company had sought to \u201cexploit the fear and concern\u201d surrounding the pandemic, adding: \u201cLorna Jane sought to profit from the fear with concerns of the public in a way that involves unlawful conduct in contravention of the relevant provisions of the Australian consumer law. The behaviour of Lorna Jane can only be described as exploitative, predatory and potentially dangerous.\u201d In a statement, the company said that it had been let down by a trusted supplier. Company CEO Bill Clarkson expanded: \u201cA trusted supplier sold us a product that did not perform as promised. They led us to believe the technology behind LJ Shield was being sold elsewhere in Australia, the USA, China, and Taiwan and that it was both anti-bacterial and anti-viral. We believed we were passing on a benefit to our customers at no extra cost to them.\u201d The incident came to light in July 2020. Clarkson added: \u201cIn the last 12 months we have reviewed the fundamentals of the production and marketing areas of our business, created new management roles in both teams and have now introduced an improved product testing regime so this cannot happen again.\u201d (TL)\n\nUS court rejects pre-emptive colour suit against Deutsche Telekom \u2013 The US District Court for the Northern District of California has rejected a case filed by San Francisco-based tech company Splunk Inc over its trademark rights in a colour gradient that includes Deutsche Telekom\u2019s signature magenta colour. Splunk filed the pre-emptive lawsuit seeking declaration that its use of a coral, magenta and orange colour gradient did not infringe the German telecoms company\u2019s US trademark rights in the colour magenta after receiving a cease and desist letter stating that the business \u201creserves its right\u201d to sue under US law. Despite similar action between the companies in Germany, the US court held that Splunk had \u201cfailed to demonstrate a reasonable apprehension of being sued in the United States\u201d, going so far as to state that the facts were \u201ca country mile\u201d from those necessary to establish jurisdiction. Neither company is out of the woods just yet though, as the court permitted Splunk to file an amended complaint to address the jurisdiction issues.

This will be done via its new arm, the F&B division, launched today in a virtual media conference.\n\nIn light of the Covid-19 pandemic, MRCA immediate past president and chief of F&B division Datuk Seri Garry Chua highlighted that the F&B division will lobby the government for extension and improvement to the Covid-19 Act and to protect and preserve retail businesses affected by the various Movement Control Orders (MCOs), for fair charges by delivery platforms and anti-competitive behaviour, for dine-in for vaccinated patrons as soon as possible, for business recovery funding for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and for government-initiated mediation on outstanding rent issues between landlords and tenants during the MCO.\n\n\u201cMRCA\u2019s F&B members are expected to gain invaluable opportunities to raise business-related issues and gain unhindered access to first-hand information from the authorities that would greatly benefit their respective businesses by leveraging on cordial relationships with various government bodies relevant to F&B operations including the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP), Human Resources Development Fund (HRDF) and Pertubuhan Keselamatan Sosial (Perkeso),\u201d said Chua.\n\nMeanwhile, the new F&B division aims to represent the voice and plight of F&B retailers with six main objectives.\n\n\u201cThese include to form a body of retailers specialising in the F&B industry among MRCA members to assist and support each other in matters of business; to arrange training, programmes, social and business networking events for its members to encourage and foster collaboration, goodwill and better understanding; to equip its members with the right skills, information and training to expand and develop their businesses particularly in the F&B industry; to promote and advance the professional development of the F&B division in the retail chain business and franchise industry; to assist and support the association in achieving and/or attaining its objectives; and any other matters that are incidental or conducive,\u201d said Chua.\n\nAlso present at the virtual conference were Tourism, Arts and Culture Minister Datuk Seri Nancy Shukri, MRCA president Shirley Tay, MRCA vice president and deputy chief of F&B division Valerie Choo and MRCA F&B division treasurer Datuk Kenneth Soh.\n\n\u201cThis new division will be a concrete and formidable platform for MRCA members, not just to assist and support each other, but also to expand the business network to foster more collaboration, goodwill, and understanding. It will also benefit entrepreneurs in developing local businesses and attract more F&B brand participation, which will ultimately increase economic activities to ensure viable long-term benefits to stakeholders within the industry,\u201d said Nancy.\n\nShe added that the F&B division is timely right now and is in line with one of their strategies, which is to enhance demand sophistication by increasing tourist experiences that are unique, differentiated and memorable. Therefore, it is important to increase the value of services and goods provided to tourists.\n\nIn anticipation of a business rebound post-pandemic, the F&B division should organise relevant workshops and training to ensure its members are well prepared to adapt to the new consumer trend and behaviour in the future.\n\n\u201cWe will provide members with knowledge and techniques to improve their operational efficiency, as well as an opportunity for expansion through franchising.

Over the next two weeks, all staff required to work on-site at HEINEKEN Malaysia\u2019s Sungei Way Brewery in Petaling Jaya are scheduled to receive their second dose of the vaccine through the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme (PICK), the Public-Private Partnership Covid-19 Industry Immunisation Programme (PIKAS), or the AstraZeneca Voluntary Opt-in Programme.\n\nFor employees based outside of Kuala Lumpur and Selangor, the Company will secure their vaccination through the Selangor Covid-19 Vaccination Programme (SelVAX) designated panel clinics nationwide.\n\nRoland Bala, Managing Director of HEINEKEN Malaysia, commented: \u201cWe commend the Government on its efforts to accelerate vaccinations through various programmes. We are thankful for the efficient roll-out of PIKAS by Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which has enabled 100% of our brewery\u2019s essential workforce to receive their first dose of the vaccine last week. HEINEKEN Malaysia is committed to protecting the health and safety of our workers, getting our staff vaccinated is a big step towards ensuring we are well prepared to resume operations as soon as we can.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt HEINEKEN Malaysia, we have been implementing a rigorous process to proactively screen for and prevent the spread of Covid-19 at the workplace. Besides fully complying with all required SOPs by the Government, we test all on-site employees and contractors on a bi-weekly basis. Our operations are highly automated, thus requiring only a minimal number of workers to handle systems and machines on our a 23.72-acre site and allowing physical distancing of at least 10 metres between operators. With no\n\nvisitors allowed to our brewery and our office staff all working from home, we have effectively created a workplace bubble comprised of essential workers who are critical for production operations only. This method has ensured zero workplace clusters, so with the added protection of 100% vaccinations, we are confident that we can operate safely,\u201d Roland added.\n\nHEINEKEN Malaysia is continuing its efforts to engage the Government on allowing brewers to resume operations, albeit at a scaled down level if necessary. According to the Confederation of Malaysian Brewers Berhad (CMBB), the impact of shutting down brewers is estimated to be at least RM200 million per month. In 2020, brewers contributed more than RM2 billion in taxes to the Government. However, under the current situation, no revenue can be generated for the Government.\n\nRoland commented, \u201cWe are ready to support the Government on accelerating Malaysia\u2019s recovery. With the economy and livelihoods at stake, we are prepared to help lessen the burden and inject much needed income to support the Government\u2019s revenue collection. Our impact also goes beyond direct tax contributions but through the supply, distribution, and retail of our products through over 35,000 local businesses in Malaysia. In a time when businesses in the food and beverage industry are struggling to survive, it is crucial that we ensure uninterrupted supply of products to the market to prevent any sudden shortages.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the curtailing of distribution of products deemed as non-essential by the authorities mean that finished goods stored in external warehouse are not allowed to be delivered to replenish depleting stock levels at retail outlets which are allowed to open, including supermarkets, convenience stores, grocery shops, restaurants, and coffee shops. We recommend that the distribution of finished goods be allowed, especially when the taxes on such products have already been paid in full to the Government. With breweries unable to operate and distribution not allowed, the market is expected to be depleted of stocks in the next three weeks.

The ongoing pandemic has impacted the country\u2019s economy, overburdened the healthcare system and virtually made prisoners of its residents for months.\n\nWalk-ins are a successful way to increase vaccination rates, as seen from the \u201cJab first, register later\u201d initiative in Kapit, Sarawak in June and the United States\u2019 walk-in vaccinations in pharmacies in May. To date, Malaysia has one of the fastest vaccination rates in the world with 1.35 doses administered per 100 people.\n\nActivists and community leaders have lauded the walk-in programme and expect it to mainly benefit migrants who are in the country legally with valid work permits but could not register for a vaccine under MySejahtera for some reason or other.\n\nFilipino community leader Liezl (not her real name) is relieved to know walk-ins would begin soon in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor as many members of her community have not been able to get their vaccine due to passport issues.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good especially for those who have passports that have already expired and still waiting (to renew their passports) since last year, ever since the pandemic began,\u201d she said, adding it would also help some of her stateless members.\n\nBut the same cannot be said for irregular migrants who include the undocumented, those who were documented but became undocumented as well as migrants who work under someone else\u2019s work permit.\n\nPublic health experts and civil society officials are concerned that the walk-in programme may not work as well for them, saying most migrants are leery of stepping foot into a vaccination centre as they still fear arrest and detention despite assurances of safe passage.\n\nOn Sunday, coordinating minister for the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme (Pick) Khairy Jamaluddin Abu Bakar announced that the guidelines to administer vaccines for migrants and refugees have been approved.\n\nHe added most of the vaccinations would be handled by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to reassure the migrants.\n\nImmigration Department director-general Datuk Khairul Dzaimee Daud promised a safe passage for them, telling Bernama via WhatsApp that \u201cimmigration will not interfere in (the) vaccination programme for migrants nor station its officials near the Covid-19 vaccination sites\u201d.\n\nMERCY Malaysia president Datuk Dr Ahmad Faizal Perdaus said walk-in vaccinations would be an ideal solution for irregular migrants and refugees as long as the groups, agencies and people responsible for allowing them into the PPV (vaccination centre) and administering the vaccine adhere to the assurance given by the Immigration Department director-general.\n\nHowever, he said governmental policy did not always translate well to the people on the ground, who may end up preventing some migrants and refugees from walking in to get their vaccine.\n\n\u201cThe proof will be in the pudding. And it will be in the eating of the pudding. Unfortunately, until it actually happens, we have no way of verifying (it is safe for migrants),\u201d he said.\n\nWhile walk-in vaccinations can do wonders to increase vaccination rates, experts and activists say the government should also start reaching out to irregular migrants and refugees through other methods.\n\nCurrently, the government\u2019s outreach programmes for the bedridden, the disabled and those living in rural areas include door-to-door and drive-through vaccinations, as well as the use of community centres as PPV and mobile vaccination sites. Currently, these initiatives only serve Malaysians.\n\nDr Ahmad Faizal said the government should not wait to include irregular migrants and refugees in the outreach programmes scheduled for Phase 4 of PICK.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should wait until that long. Because migrants are a reservoir of the virus. To a lesser extent, the refugee community,\u201d he said.\n\nNon-Malaysians are overrepresented in total infections. For instance, about 20 percent of infections recorded so far in July comprised non-citizens despite them being around 10 percent of the population overall.\n\nThere were about 1.7 million foreign workers in Malaysia in 2020, according to the Ministry of Human Resources. The International Organisation for Migration estimated that there was an additional two to four million irregular migrants in 2018. As of June this year, there were more than 179,000 refugees in Malaysia, according to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR).\n\nFounder and director of Our Journey Sumitha Shaanthinni Kishna said options other than walk-in vaccinations are also needed as many migrant workers are unlikely to avail of the initiative. Her group plans to provide a mobile vaccination site for migrants as soon as the Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) approves it.\n\n\u201c(They won\u2019t go into) government premises. For undocumented migrants, past experience has shown that it is very difficult (for them) to walk into government premises. For example, hospitals. The fear is there still (of being reported to Immigration),\u201d she said.\n\nThere are early signs that the walk-in programme may yet succeed, however.\n\nWhile many irregular migrants and refugees may be leery of walk-in vaccinations, some are willing to risk it if it means getting the vaccine sooner rather than later.\n\nAn undocumented migrant from Indonesia, who asked to be identified only as Surya, said his painless experience with the AstraZeneca opt-in programme made him encourage others to get their shot as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cI told them they should go get the shot for themselves. If we get the vaccine, we won\u2019t be so afraid. Yes, life and death are up to God but we must make the effort to be safe,\u201d he said. -Bernama", "keyword": ["migrants", "efforts", "outreach", "vaccination", "walkin", "good", "vaccinations", "work", "community", "analysis", "vaccine", "irregular", "walkins", "refugees", "begin", "programme", "reach"], "summary": "Vaccinating the millions of irregular migrants in Malaysia remains part of the country\u2019s plan to gain control of Covid-19 within its borders.\nBut the same cannot be said for irregular migrants who include the undocumented, those who were documented but became undocumented as well as migrants who work under someone else\u2019s work permit.\nDr Ahmad Faizal said the government should not wait to include irregular migrants and refugees in the outreach programmes scheduled for Phase 4 of PICK.\nThe International Organisation for Migration estimated that there was an additional two to four million irregular migrants in 2018.\nThere are early signs that the walk-in programme may yet succeed, however.", "news": "The Sun Daily", "date": "2021-07-30 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Food basket programme has its limitations, acknowledges minister", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWJvcm5lb3Bvc3QuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvMTkvZm9vZC1iYXNrZXQtcHJvZ3JhbW1lLWhhcy1pdHMtbGltaXRhdGlvbnMtYWNrbm93bGVkZ2VzLW1pbmlzdGVyL9IBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2021/07/kpt-bp-180721-jl-YB-Nanta.jpg", "text": "KAPIT (July 19): Minister of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Dato Sri Alexander Nanta Linggi acknowledges the limitation in the food basket programme under the People\u2019s Wellbeing and Economic Recovery Package (Pemulih).\n\nTaking his Kapit constituency as an example, he said the allocated RM300,000 for the programme would not be able to accommodate all 15,000 households across the parliamentary area.\n\n\u201cUnder the food basket programme, every parliamentary constituency \u2013 regardless of it being undereither the ruling coalition, or the opposition \u2013 is given RM300,000.\n\n\u201cUnder Kapit, there are three DUN (State Legislative Assembly) constituencies: Pelagus, Katibas and Bukit Goram; for each DUN area, I allocate RM100,000 for their respective food baskets.

This means that the government would need more manpower and resources.\n\nTo help the government achieve this target and the country to achieve herd immunity, Columbia Asia Group has volunteered to open up vaccination centres (PPV).\n\nColumbia Asia has been proactive in registering its hospitals as vaccination centres as part of the PICK campaign. This was carried out via applications submitted to ProtectHealth Corporation Sdn Bhd (ProtectHealth), a wholly-owned non-profit subsidiary of ProtectHealth Malaysia, established under the MOH.\n\n\u201cOur hospital setup is relatively small compared to other hospitals. Nevertheless, we are determined to fight this pandemic together with the nation by helping the country to speed up the Covid-19 vaccination campaign,\u201d said Dr Sharonpal Singh, Columbia Asia Regional Emergency Services Coordinator.\n\n\u201cOur hospital team designed and constructed viable workflows and organised dedicated rooms and space so we can serve our duty as a PPV,\u201d\n\nCurrently, Columbia Asia is working with the MOH through its eight branches that are functioning as vaccination centres, namely Bintulu, Iskandar Puteri, Miri, Setapak, Puchong, Seremban, Taiping and Tebrau.\n\nSome 160 on-ground Columbia Asia hospital staff have been assigned to man these urgent vaccination exercises across Selangor, Johor, Negeri Sembilan, Perak, Sarawak and Kuala Lumpur.\n\nThe number of vaccines allocated for each hospital depends on available resources such as space and manpower. Collectively, the eight Columbia Asia hospitals are capable of vaccinating 600 people a day.\n\nIn order to expedite the vaccine rollout, Columbia Asia has been formed collaborations with corporations.\n\nFor example, in Bintulu, Columbia Asia Bintulu and Petronas worked together to set up an industrial vaccine centre at Kidurong Club in Bintulu. Some 5,000 employees who are attached to oil and gas companies based in Bintulu will be vaccinated here. It commenced operations on July 5 and offers both Covid-19 tests as well as vaccinations.\n\nOther than Bintulu, Columbia Asia Miri also joined forces with health care company Qualitas to vaccinate oil and gas employees at the Petronas Carigali office in Lutong, Miri.\n\nColumbia Asia Miri was also the first PPV in the Columbia Asia group of hospitals to commence operations when they started vaccinations on May 25.\n\nThe latest to participate in the vaccination campaign is Columbia Asia Taiping, which became the eighth hospital to offer vaccinations. This came as a huge relief to Taiping residents, who previously had to rely on just one PPV.\n\nMedical officers at each hospital are on site to perform pre-vaccination assessment. They also carry out post-vaccination observations with the help of nurses. If any side effects should occur within the observation time, patients will be treated accordingly.\n\nIf patents develop symptoms after they have gone home and need treatment afterwards, they can choose to go back to the same hospital, or visit the nearest medical facility.\n\nEveryone should do their part in the fight against Covid-19 by registering with MySejahtera to be vaccinated.\n\nOnce an appointment is made, check the location of the vaccination centre and the date of the appointment. The number and list of vaccines are based on allocated slots prepared by the district health office (PKD). Vaccination venues will depend on where vacinees live.\n\n\u201cWe hope the public will not walk in without a MySejahtera appointment or try to make an appointment directly with our hospitals. Our hospitals will contact you prior to your appointment,\u201d said Dr Sharonpal.\n\n\u201cWe do not procure the vaccines ourselves. The Malaysian government is procuring the vaccines from manufacturers and appointing third party organisations to manage the vaccine distribution. The role of a PPV is entrusted upon us and we shall abide by its rules and regulations,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cFor those who have not registered, or are hesitant to take the vaccine, we urge you to register because unvaccinated individuals can serve as a reservoir for the virus to mutate,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cVaccination provides immunity and has been largely protecting us even against the newer variants. Vaccination also protects us from requiring hospitalisation or contracting severe Covid-19,\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother benefit of vaccination is that it is more economical compared to the cost of quarantine, loss of income, and repeated testing. Vaccination may be our best exit strategy of returning to normalcy, so we are determined to be part of this programme, regardless of challenges.\u201d\n\nTo know more about Columbia Asia\u2019s Covid-19 initiatives, log onto the Covid-19 information page on the Columbia Asia website.", "keyword": ["vaccination", "sites", "hospital", "bintulu", "vaccines", "assigned", "taiping", "hospitals", "columbia", "appointment", "covid19", "vaccine"], "summary": "The eight Columbia Asia vaccination centres are located in Bintulu, Iskandar Puteri, Miri, Setapak, Puchong, Seremban, Taiping and Tebrau.\nColumbia Asia has been proactive in registering its hospitals as vaccination centres as part of the PICK campaign.\nNevertheless, we are determined to fight this pandemic together with the nation by helping the country to speed up the Covid-19 vaccination campaign,\u201d said Dr Sharonpal Singh, Columbia Asia Regional Emergency Services Coordinator.\nFor example, in Bintulu, Columbia Asia Bintulu and Petronas worked together to set up an industrial vaccine centre at Kidurong Club in Bintulu.\nThe latest to participate in the vaccination campaign is Columbia Asia Taiping, which became the eighth hospital to offer vaccinations.", "news": "CodeBlue", "date": "2021-07-19 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Malaysia\u2019s economic fundamentals still strong, supported by stable capital market, liquidity", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVib3JuZW9wb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA3LzI4L21hbGF5c2lhcy1lY29ub21pYy1mdW5kYW1lbnRhbHMtc3RpbGwtc3Ryb25nLXN1cHBvcnRlZC1ieS1zdGFibGUtY2FwaXRhbC1tYXJrZXQtbGlxdWlkaXR5L9IBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2021/03/lead1-MALAYSIA-ECON-p1.jpg", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR, July 28 (Bernama) \u2014 Malaysia\u2019s economic fundamentals are still strong and its growth prospect for the medium term is still bright, supported by a stable capital market, while the financial sector has ample liquidity and capital buffer, said Finance Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz.\n\nHe said among the issues raised by the Members of Parliament during the Special Parliament Meeting were whether the investors\u2019 confidence was affected following the Covid-19 pandemic in the country.\n\n\u201cA brief answer, no.

financial results from Ping Petroleum Ltd and SilTerra Malaysia Sdn Bhd.\n\nGroup MD Tan Sri Syed Zainal Abidin Syed Mohamed Tahir (picture) said with the oil price currently hovering above US$70 (RM295) per barrel, coupled with its enlarged shareholding of 90% in Ping, he foresees a significant improvement in revenue and profit contribution from Ping moving forward.\n\n\u201cThere is opportunity to further improve Ping\u2019s production output by rejuvenating existing wells to monetise economically attractive reserves in the Anasuria Cluster.\n\n\u201cWe are also looking into acquiring additional late cycle producing target markets as the North Sea, Malaysia and within the region as well,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve.\n\nOn June 30, DNeX equity stake in Ping rose to 90%, following the completion of the acquisition for an additional 60% stake in the upstream oil and gas player, valued at US$78 million.\n\nDNeX recorded a total revenue of RM284.6 million for the cumulative 15-month period ended March 31, 2021.\n\nOf that, the information technology and e-services segment represented RM197.8 million or 69.5%, whereas the energy segment contributed the balance RM86.8 million or 30.5%.\n\nAs at Ping\u2019s latest financial year ended Dec 31, 2020 (FY20), Ping recorded a total profit after tax of RM9.3 million on the back of RM142.4 million in revenue.\n\nHe said Ping had managed to stay profitable and generated positive operating cashflows during the year.\n\n\u201cIn relation to SilTerra, given the bullish outlook for the semiconductor sector today, where demand firmly outstrips supply and is expected to persist up to 2024, we are confident our business in the semiconductor market will grow at a strong pace.\n\n\u201cThe growing adoption of technology such as the Internet of Things, 5G, artificial intelligence and electric vehicles will continue to drive up demand for chips,\u201d Syed Zainal Abidin noted.\n\nHe added that the group has received a three-year contract extension for the National Single Window for Trade Facilitation concession up until 2024 which will continue to provide positive earnings.\n\n\u201cIt is expected to be a key contributor to our financial performance in our trade facilitation segment moving forward, contributing a revenue of about RM100 million a year,\u201d he said.\n\nThe contract extension also serves as a testament to DNeX\u2019s strength and capabilities as a leading e-services provider in trade facilitation.\n\nDNeX will continue to pursue opportunities in digitalisation among the public and private sectors in the country, he added.\n\nDNeX has secured a three-year contract with further three-year option for extension to supply installation and maintenance support services of submarine cable communications with PT Infrastruktur Telekomunikasi Indonesia (TelkomInfra).\n\nUnder the agreement, TelkomInfra will pay a standby charge of 213 billion rupiah (RM63 million) over the initial three-year period, excluding daily rates applicable depending on the work scope.\n\n\u201cWith an assumption of 65% vessel utilisation rate in a year, estimated total revenue per year,

the group\u2019s placement shares.\n\nThe exercise may be implemented in multiple tranches within six months from the date of approval of Bursa Securities or any extended period as may be approved by Bursa Securities, he explained.\n\n\u201cThe reason we opt for private placement is because it allows DNeX to bring in strategic investors which we can leverage for their track record and

According to The Grocer, the company \u2013 which sells bamboo-based toilet paper, kitchen roll, tissues and baby wipes across China, Europe, the Middle East and the United States \u2013 is working with KPMG on an IPO strategy and running a dual-track process, which includes plans to either float on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) (a sub-market of the London Stock Exchange designed to help smaller companies access capital from the public market) in 2022 or raise money in a private placing followed by a much bigger flotation on the main market a year or two later. Valuation expectations for the company stand between \u00a3150 million and \u00a3300 million for the former route, or between \u00a3300 million and \u00a3600 million for the latter. The ambitious plans would be a first for a crowdfunded business. Having grown rapidly over the past three years, Cheeky Panda sales leapt from \u00a3100,000 in 2017 to \u00a35.7 million last year, with a 200% jump in 2020. \u201cThe paper category has not been disrupted in decades,\u201d founder Chris Forbes told The Grocer. \u201cWe believe we can stand alone in the market against the big guys and become a mainstream player\u2026 We think we\u2019re being conservative with our forecasts. We\u2019re comfortable \u2013 because of the size of the category and where the consumer trends are \u2013 that we\u2019ll get to a market cap of \u00a31bn in five years.\u201d (VA)\n\nLegal radar:\n\nLorna Jane responds to fine for covid-19-related advertising claims \u2013 The Guardian reports that Lorna Jane, an activewear brand based in Australia, has been fined A$5 million for falsely claiming that items of its clothing range \u201celiminated\u201d and prevented the spread of covid-19. Specifically, advertisements claimed that its anti-virus activewear had been sprayed with a substance (LJ Shield) which protected people against pathogens, with copy stating: \u201cCure for the Spread of Covid-19? Lorna Jane Thinks So.\u201d The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) initiated legal action over the claims, with a federal judge subsequently stating that the company had sought to \u201cexploit the fear and concern\u201d surrounding the pandemic, adding: \u201cLorna Jane sought to profit from the fear with concerns of the public in a way that involves unlawful conduct in contravention of the relevant provisions of the Australian consumer law. The behaviour of Lorna Jane can only be described as exploitative, predatory and potentially dangerous.\u201d In a statement, the company said that it had been let down by a trusted supplier. Company CEO Bill Clarkson expanded: \u201cA trusted supplier sold us a product that did not perform as promised. They led us to believe the technology behind LJ Shield was being sold elsewhere in Australia, the USA, China, and Taiwan and that it was both anti-bacterial and anti-viral. We believed we were passing on a benefit to our customers at no extra cost to them.\u201d The incident came to light in July 2020. Clarkson added: \u201cIn the last 12 months we have reviewed the fundamentals of the production and marketing areas of our business, created new management roles in both teams and have now introduced an improved product testing regime so this cannot happen again.\u201d (TL)\n\nUS court rejects pre-emptive colour suit against Deutsche Telekom \u2013 The US District Court for the Northern District of California has rejected a case filed by San Francisco-based tech company Splunk Inc over its trademark rights in a colour gradient that includes Deutsche Telekom\u2019s signature magenta colour. Splunk filed the pre-emptive lawsuit seeking declaration that its use of a coral, magenta and orange colour gradient did not infringe the German telecoms company\u2019s US trademark rights in the colour magenta after receiving a cease and desist letter stating that the business \u201creserves its right\u201d to sue under US law. Despite similar action between the companies in Germany, the US court held that Splunk had \u201cfailed to demonstrate a reasonable apprehension of being sued in the United States\u201d, going so far as to state that the facts were \u201ca country mile\u201d from those necessary to establish jurisdiction. Neither company is out of the woods just yet though, as the court permitted Splunk to file an amended complaint to address the jurisdiction issues.

Over the next two weeks, all staff required to work on-site at HEINEKEN Malaysia\u2019s Sungei Way Brewery in Petaling Jaya are scheduled to receive their second dose of the vaccine through the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme (PICK), the Public-Private Partnership Covid-19 Industry Immunisation Programme (PIKAS), or the AstraZeneca Voluntary Opt-in Programme.\n\nFor employees based outside of Kuala Lumpur and Selangor, the Company will secure their vaccination through the Selangor Covid-19 Vaccination Programme (SelVAX) designated panel clinics nationwide.\n\nRoland Bala, Managing Director of HEINEKEN Malaysia, commented: \u201cWe commend the Government on its efforts to accelerate vaccinations through various programmes. We are thankful for the efficient roll-out of PIKAS by Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which has enabled 100% of our brewery\u2019s essential workforce to receive their first dose of the vaccine last week. HEINEKEN Malaysia is committed to protecting the health and safety of our workers, getting our staff vaccinated is a big step towards ensuring we are well prepared to resume operations as soon as we can.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt HEINEKEN Malaysia, we have been implementing a rigorous process to proactively screen for and prevent the spread of Covid-19 at the workplace. Besides fully complying with all required SOPs by the Government, we test all on-site employees and contractors on a bi-weekly basis. Our operations are highly automated, thus requiring only a minimal number of workers to handle systems and machines on our a 23.72-acre site and allowing physical distancing of at least 10 metres between operators. With no\n\nvisitors allowed to our brewery and our office staff all working from home, we have effectively created a workplace bubble comprised of essential workers who are critical for production operations only. This method has ensured zero workplace clusters, so with the added protection of 100% vaccinations, we are confident that we can operate safely,\u201d Roland added.\n\nHEINEKEN Malaysia is continuing its efforts to engage the Government on allowing brewers to resume operations, albeit at a scaled down level if necessary. According to the Confederation of Malaysian Brewers Berhad (CMBB), the impact of shutting down brewers is estimated to be at least RM200 million per month. In 2020, brewers contributed more than RM2 billion in taxes to the Government. However, under the current situation, no revenue can be generated for the Government.\n\nRoland commented, \u201cWe are ready to support the Government on accelerating Malaysia\u2019s recovery. With the economy and livelihoods at stake, we are prepared to help lessen the burden and inject much needed income to support the Government\u2019s revenue collection. Our impact also goes beyond direct tax contributions but through the supply, distribution, and retail of our products through over 35,000 local businesses in Malaysia. In a time when businesses in the food and beverage industry are struggling to survive, it is crucial that we ensure uninterrupted supply of products to the market to prevent any sudden shortages.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the curtailing of distribution of products deemed as non-essential by the authorities mean that finished goods stored in external warehouse are not allowed to be delivered to replenish depleting stock levels at retail outlets which are allowed to open, including supermarkets, convenience stores, grocery shops, restaurants, and coffee shops. We recommend that the distribution of finished goods be allowed, especially when the taxes on such products have already been paid in full to the Government. With breweries unable to operate and distribution not allowed, the market is expected to be depleted of stocks in the next three weeks. We are concerned that consumers may turn to illicit products that may be harmful to health.

The ongoing pandemic has impacted the country\u2019s economy, overburdened the healthcare system and virtually made prisoners of its residents for months.\n\nWalk-ins are a successful way to increase vaccination rates, as seen from the \u201cJab first, register later\u201d initiative in Kapit, Sarawak in June and the United States\u2019 walk-in vaccinations in pharmacies in May. To date, Malaysia has one of the fastest vaccination rates in the world with 1.35 doses administered per 100 people.\n\nActivists and community leaders have lauded the walk-in programme and expect it to mainly benefit migrants who are in the country legally with valid work permits but could not register for a vaccine under MySejahtera for some reason or other.\n\nFilipino community leader Liezl (not her real name) is relieved to know walk-ins would begin soon in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor as many members of her community have not been able to get their vaccine due to passport issues.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good especially for those who have passports that have already expired and still waiting (to renew their passports) since last year, ever since the pandemic began,\u201d she said, adding it would also help some of her stateless members.\n\nBut the same cannot be said for irregular migrants who include the undocumented, those who were documented but became undocumented as well as migrants who work under someone else\u2019s work permit.\n\nPublic health experts and civil society officials are concerned that the walk-in programme may not work as well for them, saying most migrants are leery of stepping foot into a vaccination centre as they still fear arrest and detention despite assurances of safe passage.\n\nOn Sunday, coordinating minister for the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme (Pick) Khairy Jamaluddin Abu Bakar announced that the guidelines to administer vaccines for migrants and refugees have been approved.\n\nHe added most of the vaccinations would be handled by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to reassure the migrants.\n\nImmigration Department director-general Datuk Khairul Dzaimee Daud promised a safe passage for them, telling Bernama via WhatsApp that \u201cimmigration will not interfere in (the) vaccination programme for migrants nor station its officials near the Covid-19 vaccination sites\u201d.\n\nMERCY Malaysia president Datuk Dr Ahmad Faizal Perdaus said walk-in vaccinations would be an ideal solution for irregular migrants and refugees as long as the groups, agencies and people responsible for allowing them into the PPV (vaccination centre) and administering the vaccine adhere to the assurance given by the Immigration Department director-general.\n\nHowever, he said governmental policy did not always translate well to the people on the ground, who may end up preventing some migrants and refugees from walking in to get their vaccine.\n\n\u201cThe proof will be in the pudding. And it will be in the eating of the pudding. Unfortunately, until it actually happens, we have no way of verifying (it is safe for migrants),\u201d he said.\n\nWhile walk-in vaccinations can do wonders to increase vaccination rates, experts and activists say the government should also start reaching out to irregular migrants and refugees through other methods.\n\nCurrently, the government\u2019s outreach programmes for the bedridden, the disabled and those living in rural areas include door-to-door and drive-through vaccinations, as well as the use of community centres as PPV and mobile vaccination sites. Currently, these initiatives only serve Malaysians.\n\nDr Ahmad Faizal said the government should not wait to include irregular migrants and refugees in the outreach programmes scheduled for Phase 4 of PICK.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should wait until that long. Because migrants are a reservoir of the virus. To a lesser extent, the refugee community,\u201d he said.\n\nNon-Malaysians are overrepresented in total infections. For instance, about 20 percent of infections recorded so far in July comprised non-citizens despite them being around 10 percent of the population overall.\n\nThere were about 1.7 million foreign workers in Malaysia in 2020, according to the Ministry of Human Resources. The International Organisation for Migration estimated that there was an additional two to four million irregular migrants in 2018. As of June this year, there were more than 179,000 refugees in Malaysia, according to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR).\n\nFounder and director of Our Journey Sumitha Shaanthinni Kishna said options other than walk-in vaccinations are also needed as many migrant workers are unlikely to avail of the initiative. Her group plans to provide a mobile vaccination site for migrants as soon as the Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) approves it.\n\n\u201c(They won\u2019t go into) government premises. For undocumented migrants, past experience has shown that it is very difficult (for them) to walk into government premises. For example, hospitals. The fear is there still (of being reported to Immigration),\u201d she said.\n\nThere are early signs that the walk-in programme may yet succeed, however.\n\nWhile many irregular migrants and refugees may be leery of walk-in vaccinations, some are willing to risk it if it means getting the vaccine sooner rather than later.\n\nAn undocumented migrant from Indonesia, who asked to be identified only as Surya, said his painless experience with the AstraZeneca opt-in programme made him encourage others to get their shot as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cI told them they should go get the shot for themselves. If we get the vaccine, we won\u2019t be so afraid. Yes, life and death are up to God but we must make the effort to be safe,\u201d he said. -Bernama", "keyword": ["migrants", "efforts", "outreach", "vaccination", "walkin", "good", "vaccinations", "work", "community", "analysis", "vaccine", "irregular", "walkins", "refugees", "begin", "programme", "reach"], "summary": "Vaccinating the millions of irregular migrants in Malaysia remains part of the country\u2019s plan to gain control of Covid-19 within its borders.\nBut the same cannot be said for irregular migrants who include the undocumented, those who were documented but became undocumented as well as migrants who work under someone else\u2019s work permit.\nDr Ahmad Faizal said the government should not wait to include irregular migrants and refugees in the outreach programmes scheduled for Phase 4 of PICK.\nThe International Organisation for Migration estimated that there was an additional two to four million irregular migrants in 2018.\nThere are early signs that the walk-in programme may yet succeed, however.", "news": "The Sun Daily", "date": "2021-07-30 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Food basket programme has its limitations, acknowledges minister", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWJvcm5lb3Bvc3QuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvMTkvZm9vZC1iYXNrZXQtcHJvZ3JhbW1lLWhhcy1pdHMtbGltaXRhdGlvbnMtYWNrbm93bGVkZ2VzLW1pbmlzdGVyL9IBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2021/07/kpt-bp-180721-jl-YB-Nanta.jpg", "text": "KAPIT (July 19): Minister of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Dato Sri Alexander Nanta Linggi acknowledges the limitation in the food basket programme under the People\u2019s Wellbeing and Economic Recovery Package (Pemulih).\n\nTaking his Kapit constituency as an example, he said the allocated RM300,000 for the programme would not be able to accommodate all 15,000 households across the parliamentary area.\n\n\u201cUnder the food basket programme, every parliamentary constituency \u2013 regardless of it being undereither the ruling coalition, or the opposition \u2013 is given RM300,000.\n\n\u201cUnder Kapit, there are three DUN (State Legislative Assembly) constituencies: Pelagus, Katibas and Bukit Goram; for each DUN area, I allocate RM100,000 for their respective food baskets.

This means that the government would need more manpower and resources.\n\nTo help the government achieve this target and the country to achieve herd immunity, Columbia Asia Group has volunteered to open up vaccination centres (PPV).\n\nColumbia Asia has been proactive in registering its hospitals as vaccination centres as part of the PICK campaign. This was carried out via applications submitted to ProtectHealth Corporation Sdn Bhd (ProtectHealth), a wholly-owned non-profit subsidiary of ProtectHealth Malaysia, established under the MOH.\n\n\u201cOur hospital setup is relatively small compared to other hospitals. Nevertheless, we are determined to fight this pandemic together with the nation by helping the country to speed up the Covid-19 vaccination campaign,\u201d said Dr Sharonpal Singh, Columbia Asia Regional Emergency Services Coordinator.\n\n\u201cOur hospital team designed and constructed viable workflows and organised dedicated rooms and space so we can serve our duty as a PPV,\u201d\n\nCurrently, Columbia Asia is working with the MOH through its eight branches that are functioning as vaccination centres, namely Bintulu, Iskandar Puteri, Miri, Setapak, Puchong, Seremban, Taiping and Tebrau.\n\nSome 160 on-ground Columbia Asia hospital staff have been assigned to man these urgent vaccination exercises across Selangor, Johor, Negeri Sembilan, Perak, Sarawak and Kuala Lumpur.\n\nThe number of vaccines allocated for each hospital depends on available resources such as space and manpower. Collectively, the eight Columbia Asia hospitals are capable of vaccinating 600 people a day.\n\nIn order to expedite the vaccine rollout, Columbia Asia has been formed collaborations with corporations.\n\nFor example, in Bintulu, Columbia Asia Bintulu and Petronas worked together to set up an industrial vaccine centre at Kidurong Club in Bintulu. Some 5,000 employees who are attached to oil and gas companies based in Bintulu will be vaccinated here. It commenced operations on July 5 and offers both Covid-19 tests as well as vaccinations.\n\nOther than Bintulu, Columbia Asia Miri also joined forces with health care company Qualitas to vaccinate oil and gas employees at the Petronas Carigali office in Lutong, Miri.\n\nColumbia Asia Miri was also the first PPV in the Columbia Asia group of hospitals to commence operations when they started vaccinations on May 25.\n\nThe latest to participate in the vaccination campaign is Columbia Asia Taiping, which became the eighth hospital to offer vaccinations. This came as a huge relief to Taiping residents, who previously had to rely on just one PPV.\n\nMedical officers at each hospital are on site to perform pre-vaccination assessment. They also carry out post-vaccination observations with the help of nurses. If any side effects should occur within the observation time, patients will be treated accordingly.\n\nIf patents develop symptoms after they have gone home and need treatment afterwards, they can choose to go back to the same hospital, or visit the nearest medical facility.\n\nEveryone should do their part in the fight against Covid-19 by registering with MySejahtera to be vaccinated.\n\nOnce an appointment is made, check the location of the vaccination centre and the date of the appointment. The number and list of vaccines are based on allocated slots prepared by the district health office (PKD). Vaccination venues will depend on where vacinees live.\n\n\u201cWe hope the public will not walk in without a MySejahtera appointment or try to make an appointment directly with our hospitals. Our hospitals will contact you prior to your appointment,\u201d said Dr Sharonpal.\n\n\u201cWe do not procure the vaccines ourselves. The Malaysian government is procuring the vaccines from manufacturers and appointing third party organisations to manage the vaccine distribution. The role of a PPV is entrusted upon us and we shall abide by its rules and regulations,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cFor those who have not registered, or are hesitant to take the vaccine, we urge you to register because unvaccinated individuals can serve as a reservoir for the virus to mutate,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cVaccination provides immunity and has been largely protecting us even against the newer variants. Vaccination also protects us from requiring hospitalisation or contracting severe Covid-19,\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother benefit of vaccination is that it is more economical compared to the cost of quarantine, loss of income, and repeated testing. Vaccination may be our best exit strategy of returning to normalcy, so we are determined to be part of this programme, regardless of challenges.\u201d\n\nTo know more about Columbia Asia\u2019s Covid-19 initiatives, log onto the Covid-19 information page on the Columbia Asia website.", "keyword": ["vaccination", "sites", "hospital", "bintulu", "vaccines", "assigned", "taiping", "hospitals", "columbia", "appointment", "covid19", "vaccine"], "summary": "The eight Columbia Asia vaccination centres are located in Bintulu, Iskandar Puteri, Miri, Setapak, Puchong, Seremban, Taiping and Tebrau.\nColumbia Asia has been proactive in registering its hospitals as vaccination centres as part of the PICK campaign.\nNevertheless, we are determined to fight this pandemic together with the nation by helping the country to speed up the Covid-19 vaccination campaign,\u201d said Dr Sharonpal Singh, Columbia Asia Regional Emergency Services Coordinator.\nFor example, in Bintulu, Columbia Asia Bintulu and Petronas worked together to set up an industrial vaccine centre at Kidurong Club in Bintulu.\nThe latest to participate in the vaccination campaign is Columbia Asia Taiping, which became the eighth hospital to offer vaccinations.", "news": "CodeBlue", "date": "2021-07-19 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Malaysia\u2019s economic fundamentals still strong, supported by stable capital market, liquidity", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVib3JuZW9wb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA3LzI4L21hbGF5c2lhcy1lY29ub21pYy1mdW5kYW1lbnRhbHMtc3RpbGwtc3Ryb25nLXN1cHBvcnRlZC1ieS1zdGFibGUtY2FwaXRhbC1tYXJrZXQtbGlxdWlkaXR5L9IBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2021/03/lead1-MALAYSIA-ECON-p1.jpg", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR, July 28 (Bernama) \u2014 Malaysia\u2019s economic fundamentals are still strong and its growth prospect for the medium term is still bright, supported by a stable capital market, while the financial sector has ample liquidity and capital buffer, said Finance Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz.\n\nHe said among the issues raised by the Members of Parliament during the Special Parliament Meeting were whether the investors\u2019 confidence was affected following the Covid-19 pandemic in the country.\n\n\u201cA brief answer, no.

private sectors in the country\n\nby NUR HANANI AZMAN / Pic by TMR FILE PIX\n\nDAGANG NeXchange Bhd (DNeX) expects the group financial performance moving forward will improve with the consolidation of financial results from Ping Petroleum Ltd and SilTerra Malaysia Sdn Bhd.\n\nGroup MD Tan Sri Syed Zainal Abidin Syed Mohamed Tahir (picture) said with the oil price currently hovering above US$70 (RM295) per barrel, coupled with its enlarged shareholding of 90% in Ping, he foresees a significant improvement in revenue and profit contribution from Ping moving forward.\n\n\u201cThere is opportunity to further improve Ping\u2019s production output by rejuvenating existing wells to monetise economically attractive reserves in the Anasuria Cluster.\n\n\u201cWe are also looking into acquiring additional late cycle producing target markets as the North Sea, Malaysia and within the region as well,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve.\n\nOn June 30, DNeX equity stake in Ping rose to 90%, following the completion of the acquisition for an additional 60% stake in the upstream oil and gas player, valued at US$78 million.\n\nDNeX recorded a total revenue of RM284.6 million for the cumulative 15-month period ended March 31, 2021.\n\nOf that, the information technology and e-services segment represented RM197.8 million or 69.5%, whereas the energy segment contributed the balance RM86.8 million or 30.5%.\n\nAs at Ping\u2019s latest financial year ended Dec 31, 2020 (FY20), Ping recorded a total profit after tax of RM9.3 million on the back of RM142.4 million in revenue.\n\nHe said Ping had managed to stay profitable and generated positive operating cashflows during the year.\n\n\u201cIn relation to SilTerra, given the bullish outlook for the semiconductor sector today, where demand firmly outstrips supply and is expected to persist up to 2024, we are confident our business in the semiconductor market will grow at a strong pace.\n\n\u201cThe growing adoption of technology such as the Internet of Things, 5G, artificial intelligence and electric vehicles will continue to drive up demand for chips,\u201d Syed Zainal Abidin noted.\n\nHe added that the group has received a three-year contract extension for the National Single Window for Trade Facilitation concession up until 2024 which will continue to provide positive earnings.\n\n\u201cIt is expected to be a key contributor to our financial performance in our trade facilitation segment moving forward, contributing a revenue of about RM100 million a year,\u201d he said.\n\nThe contract extension also serves as a testament to DNeX\u2019s strength and capabilities as a leading e-services provider in trade facilitation.\n\nDNeX will continue to pursue opportunities in digitalisation among the public and private sectors in the country, he added.\n\nDNeX has secured a three-year contract with further three-year option for extension to supply installation and maintenance support services of submarine cable communications with PT Infrastruktur Telekomunikasi Indonesia (TelkomInfra).\n\nUnder the agreement, TelkomInfra will pay a standby charge of 213 billion rupiah (RM63 million) over the initial three-year period, excluding daily rates applicable depending on the work scope.\n\n\u201cWith an assumption of 65% vessel utilisation rate in a year, estimated total revenue per year, including standby charge, is about 215 billion rupiah.\n\n\n\n\u201cThus, revenue for the initial three years of contract can reach up to RM186 million, and RM372 million with the additional three-year option,\u201d he added.\n\nOn DNeX plans to raise RM642 million, Syed Zainal Abidin said the duration of the timeframe for the implementation of this exercise hinges on the take-up rate of the group\u2019s placement shares.\n\nThe exercise may be implemented in multiple tranches within six months from the date of approval of Bursa Securities or any extended period as may be approved by Bursa Securities, he explained.\n\n\u201cThe reason we opt for private placement is because it allows DNeX to bring in strategic investors which we can leverage for their track record and capabilities, to add value to our business and fuel our future growth. This can benefit minority shareholders in the long run,\u201d he reckoned.", "keyword": ["financial", "earnings", "consolidation", "continue", "ping", "sees", "boost", "million", "contract", "dnex",

Abdullah (picture) said in particular, based on the survey, three out of 10 women in the reproductive ages of between 15 and 49 years old suffer from anaemia.\n\n\u201cAnaemia can result in premature birth and affect mental, physical and cognitive development which in turn will lead to low birth weight and stunted growth,\u201d he said in a statement, today.\n\nHe said among the causes of anaemia are iron and folic acid deficiency which could also cause permanent defects in infants such as neural tube defects (NTD).\n\n\u201cNTD is a problem of the formation and growth of the baby\u2019s nerves while in the womb that can cause the baby to be born with an incomplete skull, stunted brain growth and imperfect spine formation,\u201d he said.\n\nDr Noor Hisham said the problem further increases the cost of rehabilitation and patient management, reduces the quality of life and could lead to death.\n\nIn this regard, he said the fortification of subsidised wheat flour with iron and folic acid could help the people, especially the low-income group to get access to nutritious food to improve their nutritional and health status, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic period.\n\nHe said the initiative by the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) also received good cooperation from wheat flour manufacturers and hoped the support would continue.\n\nHe also said the continued support from manufacturers was important in the Health Ministry\u2019s (MOH) efforts to fortify all wheat flour in the local market with iron and folic acid on a mandatory

and noted that all wheat flour manufacturers involved have been implementing this since July 1.\n\n\u201cThe implementation of this initiative is in line with the MOH\u2019s recommendations where it

The seizure, which took place over the weekend, involved a raid of three premises that sold various types of face mask.

According to The Grocer, the company \u2013 which sells bamboo-based toilet paper, kitchen roll, tissues and baby wipes across China, Europe, the Middle East and the United States \u2013 is working with KPMG on an IPO strategy and running a dual-track process, which includes plans to either float on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) (a sub-market of the London Stock Exchange designed to help smaller companies access capital from the public market) in 2022 or raise money in a private placing followed by a much bigger flotation on the main market a year or two later. Valuation expectations for the company stand between \u00a3150 million and \u00a3300 million for the former route, or between \u00a3300 million and \u00a3600 million for the latter. The ambitious plans would be a first for a crowdfunded business. Having grown rapidly over the past three years, Cheeky Panda sales leapt from \u00a3100,000 in 2017 to \u00a35.7 million last year, with a 200% jump in 2020. \u201cThe paper category has not been disrupted in decades,\u201d founder Chris Forbes told The Grocer. \u201cWe believe we can stand alone in the market against the big guys and become a mainstream player\u2026 We think we\u2019re being conservative with our forecasts.

Specifically, advertisements claimed that its anti-virus activewear had been sprayed with a substance (LJ Shield) which protected people against pathogens, with copy stating: \u201cCure for the Spread of Covid-19? Lorna Jane Thinks So.\u201d The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) initiated legal action over the claims, with a federal judge subsequently stating that the company had sought to \u201cexploit the fear and concern\u201d surrounding the pandemic, adding: \u201cLorna Jane sought to profit from the fear with concerns of the public in a way that involves unlawful conduct in contravention of the relevant provisions of the Australian consumer law. The behaviour of Lorna Jane can only be described as exploitative, predatory and potentially dangerous.\u201d In a statement, the company said that it had been let down by a trusted supplier. Company CEO Bill Clarkson expanded: \u201cA trusted supplier sold us a product that did not perform as promised. They led us to believe the technology behind LJ Shield was being sold elsewhere in Australia, the USA, China, and Taiwan and that it was both anti-bacterial and anti-viral. We believed we were passing on a benefit to our customers at no extra cost to them.\u201d The incident came to light in July 2020. Clarkson added: \u201cIn the last 12 months we have reviewed the fundamentals of the production and marketing areas of our business, created new management roles in both teams and have now introduced an improved product testing regime so this cannot happen again.\u201d (TL)\n\nUS court rejects pre-emptive colour suit against Deutsche Telekom \u2013 The US District Court for the Northern District of California has rejected a case filed by San Francisco-based tech company Splunk Inc over its trademark rights in a colour gradient that includes Deutsche Telekom\u2019s signature magenta colour. Splunk filed the pre-emptive lawsuit seeking declaration that its use of a coral, magenta and orange colour gradient did not infringe the German telecoms company\u2019s US trademark rights in the colour magenta after receiving a cease and desist letter stating that the business \u201creserves its right\u201d to sue under US law. Despite similar action between the companies in Germany, the US court held that Splunk had \u201cfailed to demonstrate a reasonable apprehension of being sued in the United States\u201d, going so far as to state that the facts were \u201ca country mile\u201d from those necessary to establish jurisdiction. Neither company is out of the woods just yet though, as the court permitted Splunk to file an amended complaint to address the jurisdiction issues.

This will be done via its new arm, the F&B division, launched today in a virtual media conference.\n\nIn light of the Covid-19 pandemic, MRCA immediate past president and chief of F&B division Datuk Seri Garry Chua highlighted that the F&B division will lobby the government for extension and improvement to the Covid-19 Act and to protect and preserve retail businesses affected by the various Movement Control Orders (MCOs), for fair charges by delivery platforms and anti-competitive behaviour, for dine-in for vaccinated patrons as soon as possible, for business recovery funding for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and for government-initiated mediation on outstanding rent issues between landlords and tenants during the MCO.\n\n\u201cMRCA\u2019s F&B members are expected to gain invaluable opportunities to raise business-related issues and gain unhindered access to first-hand information from the authorities that would greatly benefit their respective businesses by leveraging on cordial relationships with various government bodies relevant to F&B operations including the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP), Human Resources Development Fund (HRDF) and Pertubuhan Keselamatan Sosial (Perkeso),\u201d said Chua.\n\nMeanwhile, the new F&B division aims to represent the voice and plight of F&B retailers with six main objectives.\n\n\u201cThese include to form a body of retailers specialising in the F&B industry among MRCA members to assist and support each other in matters of business; to arrange training, programmes, social and business networking events for its members to encourage and foster collaboration, goodwill and better understanding; to equip its members with the right skills, information and training to expand and develop their businesses particularly in the F&B industry; to promote and advance the professional development of the F&B division in the retail chain business and franchise industry; to assist and support the association in achieving and/or attaining its objectives; and any other matters that are incidental or conducive,\u201d said Chua.\n\nAlso present at the virtual conference were Tourism, Arts and Culture Minister Datuk Seri Nancy Shukri, MRCA president Shirley Tay, MRCA vice president and deputy chief of F&B division Valerie Choo and MRCA F&B division treasurer Datuk Kenneth Soh.\n\n\u201cThis new division will be a concrete and formidable platform for MRCA members, not just to assist and support each other, but also to expand the business network to foster more collaboration, goodwill, and understanding. It will also benefit entrepreneurs in developing local businesses and attract more F&B brand participation, which will ultimately increase economic activities to ensure viable long-term benefits to stakeholders within the industry,\u201d said Nancy.\n\nShe added that the F&B division is timely right now and is in line with one of their strategies, which is to enhance demand sophistication by increasing tourist experiences that are unique, differentiated and memorable. Therefore, it is important to increase the value of services and goods provided to tourists.\n\nIn anticipation of a business rebound post-pandemic, the F&B division should organise relevant workshops and training to ensure its members are well prepared to adapt to the new consumer trend and behaviour in the future.\n\n\u201cWe will provide members with knowledge and techniques to improve their operational efficiency, as well as an opportunity for expansion through franchising.

Over the next two weeks, all staff required to work on-site at HEINEKEN Malaysia\u2019s Sungei Way Brewery in Petaling Jaya are scheduled to receive their second dose of the vaccine through the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme (PICK), the Public-Private Partnership Covid-19 Industry Immunisation Programme (PIKAS), or the AstraZeneca Voluntary Opt-in Programme.\n\nFor employees based outside of Kuala Lumpur and Selangor, the Company will secure their vaccination through the Selangor Covid-19 Vaccination Programme (SelVAX) designated panel clinics nationwide.\n\nRoland Bala, Managing Director of HEINEKEN Malaysia, commented: \u201cWe commend the Government on its efforts to accelerate vaccinations through various programmes. We are thankful for the efficient roll-out of PIKAS by Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which has enabled 100% of our brewery\u2019s essential workforce to receive their first dose of the vaccine last week. HEINEKEN Malaysia is committed to protecting the health and safety of our workers, getting our staff vaccinated is a big step towards ensuring we are well prepared to resume operations as soon as we can.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt HEINEKEN Malaysia, we have been implementing a rigorous process to proactively screen for and prevent the spread of Covid-19 at the workplace. Besides fully complying with all required SOPs by the Government, we test all on-site employees and contractors on a bi-weekly basis. Our operations are highly automated, thus requiring only a minimal number of workers to handle systems and machines on our a 23.72-acre site and allowing physical distancing of at least 10 metres between operators. With no\n\nvisitors allowed to our brewery and our office staff all working from home, we have effectively created a workplace bubble comprised of essential workers who are critical for production operations only. This method has ensured zero workplace clusters, so with the added protection of 100% vaccinations, we are confident that we can operate safely,\u201d Roland added.\n\nHEINEKEN Malaysia is continuing its efforts to engage the Government on allowing brewers to resume operations, albeit at a scaled down level if necessary. According to the Confederation of Malaysian Brewers Berhad (CMBB), the impact of shutting down brewers is estimated to be at least RM200 million per month. In 2020, brewers contributed more than RM2 billion in taxes to the Government. However, under the current situation, no revenue can be generated for the Government.\n\nRoland commented, \u201cWe are ready to support the Government on accelerating Malaysia\u2019s recovery. With the economy and livelihoods at stake, we are prepared to help lessen the burden and inject much needed income to support the Government\u2019s revenue collection. Our impact also goes beyond direct tax contributions but through the supply, distribution, and retail of our products through over 35,000 local businesses in Malaysia. In a time when businesses in the food and beverage industry are struggling to survive, it is crucial that we ensure uninterrupted supply of products to the market to prevent any sudden shortages.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the curtailing of distribution of products deemed as non-essential by the authorities mean that finished goods stored in external warehouse are not allowed to be delivered to replenish depleting stock levels at retail outlets which are allowed to open, including supermarkets, convenience stores, grocery shops, restaurants, and coffee shops. We recommend that the distribution of finished goods be allowed, especially when the taxes on such products have already been paid in full to the Government. With breweries unable to operate and distribution not allowed, the market is expected to be depleted of stocks in the next three weeks.

The ongoing pandemic has impacted the country\u2019s economy, overburdened the healthcare system and virtually made prisoners of its residents for months.\n\nWalk-ins are a successful way to increase vaccination rates, as seen from the \u201cJab first, register later\u201d initiative in Kapit, Sarawak in June and the United States\u2019 walk-in vaccinations in pharmacies in May. To date, Malaysia has one of the fastest vaccination rates in the world with 1.35 doses administered per 100 people.\n\nActivists and community leaders have lauded the walk-in programme and expect it to mainly benefit migrants who are in the country legally with valid work permits but could not register for a vaccine under MySejahtera for some reason or other.\n\nFilipino community leader Liezl (not her real name) is relieved to know walk-ins would begin soon in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor as many members of her community have not been able to get their vaccine due to passport issues.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good especially for those who have passports that have already expired and still waiting (to renew their passports) since last year, ever since the pandemic began,\u201d she said, adding it would also help some of her stateless members.\n\nBut the same cannot be said for irregular migrants who include the undocumented, those who were documented but became undocumented as well as migrants who work under someone else\u2019s work permit.\n\nPublic health experts and civil society officials are concerned that the walk-in programme may not work as well for them, saying most migrants are leery of stepping foot into a vaccination centre as they still fear arrest and detention despite assurances of safe passage.\n\nOn Sunday, coordinating minister for the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme (Pick) Khairy Jamaluddin Abu Bakar announced that the guidelines to administer vaccines for migrants and refugees have been approved.\n\nHe added most of the vaccinations would be handled by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to reassure the migrants.\n\nImmigration Department director-general Datuk Khairul Dzaimee Daud promised a safe passage for them, telling Bernama via WhatsApp that \u201cimmigration will not interfere in (the) vaccination programme for migrants nor station its officials near the Covid-19 vaccination sites\u201d.\n\nMERCY Malaysia president Datuk Dr Ahmad Faizal Perdaus said walk-in vaccinations would be an ideal solution for irregular migrants and refugees as long as the groups, agencies and people responsible for allowing them into the PPV (vaccination centre) and administering the vaccine adhere to the assurance given by the Immigration Department director-general.\n\nHowever, he said governmental policy did not always translate well to the people on the ground, who may end up preventing some migrants and refugees from walking in to get their vaccine.\n\n\u201cThe proof will be in the pudding. And it will be in the eating of the pudding. Unfortunately, until it actually happens, we have no way of verifying (it is safe for migrants),\u201d he said.\n\nWhile walk-in vaccinations can do wonders to increase vaccination rates, experts and activists say the government should also start reaching out to irregular migrants and refugees through other methods.\n\nCurrently, the government\u2019s outreach programmes for the bedridden, the disabled and those living in rural areas include door-to-door and drive-through vaccinations, as well as the use of community centres as PPV and mobile vaccination sites. Currently, these initiatives only serve Malaysians.\n\nDr Ahmad Faizal said the government should not wait to include irregular migrants and refugees in the outreach programmes scheduled for Phase 4 of PICK.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should wait until that long. Because migrants are a reservoir of the virus. To a lesser extent, the refugee community,\u201d he said.\n\nNon-Malaysians are overrepresented in total infections. For instance, about 20 percent of infections recorded so far in July comprised non-citizens despite them being around 10 percent of the population overall.\n\nThere were about 1.7 million foreign workers in Malaysia in 2020, according to the Ministry of Human Resources. The International Organisation for Migration estimated that there was an additional two to four million irregular migrants in 2018. As of June this year, there were more than 179,000 refugees in Malaysia, according to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR).\n\nFounder and director of Our Journey Sumitha Shaanthinni Kishna said options other than walk-in vaccinations are also needed as many migrant workers are unlikely to avail of the initiative. Her group plans to provide a mobile vaccination site for migrants as soon as the Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) approves it.\n\n\u201c(They won\u2019t go into) government premises. For undocumented migrants, past experience has shown that it is very difficult (for them) to walk into government premises. For example, hospitals. The fear is there still (of being reported to Immigration),\u201d she said.\n\nThere are early signs that the walk-in programme may yet succeed, however.\n\nWhile many irregular migrants and refugees may be leery of walk-in vaccinations, some are willing to risk it if it means getting the vaccine sooner rather than later.\n\nAn undocumented migrant from Indonesia, who asked to be identified only as Surya, said his painless experience with the AstraZeneca opt-in programme made him encourage others to get their shot as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cI told them they should go get the shot for themselves. If we get the vaccine, we won\u2019t be so afraid.

This means that the government would need more manpower and resources.\n\nTo help the government achieve this target and the country to achieve herd immunity, Columbia Asia Group has volunteered to open up vaccination centres (PPV).\n\nColumbia Asia has been proactive in registering its hospitals as vaccination centres as part of the PICK campaign. This was carried out via applications submitted to ProtectHealth Corporation Sdn Bhd (ProtectHealth), a wholly-owned non-profit subsidiary of ProtectHealth Malaysia, established under the MOH.\n\n\u201cOur hospital setup is relatively small compared to other hospitals. Nevertheless, we are determined to fight this pandemic together with the nation by helping the country to speed up the Covid-19 vaccination campaign,\u201d said Dr Sharonpal Singh, Columbia Asia Regional Emergency Services Coordinator.\n\n\u201cOur hospital team designed and constructed viable workflows and organised dedicated rooms and space so we can serve our duty as a PPV,\u201d\n\nCurrently, Columbia Asia is working with the MOH through its eight branches that are functioning as vaccination centres, namely Bintulu, Iskandar Puteri, Miri, Setapak, Puchong, Seremban, Taiping and Tebrau.\n\nSome 160 on-ground Columbia Asia hospital staff have been assigned to man these urgent vaccination exercises across Selangor, Johor, Negeri Sembilan, Perak, Sarawak and Kuala Lumpur.\n\nThe number of vaccines allocated for each hospital depends on available resources such as space and manpower. Collectively, the eight Columbia Asia hospitals are capable of vaccinating 600 people a day.\n\nIn order to expedite the vaccine rollout, Columbia Asia has been formed collaborations with corporations.\n\nFor example, in Bintulu, Columbia Asia Bintulu and Petronas worked together to set up an industrial vaccine centre at Kidurong Club in Bintulu. Some 5,000 employees who are attached to oil and gas companies based in Bintulu will be vaccinated here. It commenced operations on July 5 and offers both Covid-19 tests as well as vaccinations.\n\nOther than Bintulu, Columbia Asia Miri also joined forces with health care company Qualitas to vaccinate oil and gas employees at the Petronas Carigali office in Lutong, Miri.\n\nColumbia Asia Miri was also the first PPV in the Columbia Asia group of hospitals to commence operations when they started vaccinations on May 25.\n\nThe latest to participate in the vaccination campaign is Columbia Asia Taiping, which became the eighth hospital to offer vaccinations. This came as a huge relief to Taiping residents, who previously had to rely on just one PPV.\n\nMedical officers at each hospital are on site to perform pre-vaccination assessment. They also carry out post-vaccination observations with the help of nurses. If any side effects should occur within the observation time, patients will be treated accordingly.\n\nIf patents develop symptoms after they have gone home and need treatment afterwards, they can choose to go back to the same hospital, or visit the nearest medical facility.\n\nEveryone should do their part in the fight against Covid-19 by registering with MySejahtera to be vaccinated.\n\nOnce an appointment is made, check the location of the vaccination centre and the date of the appointment. The number and list of vaccines are based on allocated slots prepared by the district health office (PKD). Vaccination venues will depend on where vacinees live.\n\n\u201cWe hope the public will not walk in without a MySejahtera appointment or try to make an appointment directly with our hospitals. Our hospitals will contact you prior to your appointment,\u201d said Dr Sharonpal.\n\n\u201cWe do not procure the vaccines ourselves. The Malaysian government is procuring the vaccines from manufacturers and appointing third party organisations to manage the vaccine distribution. The role of a PPV is entrusted upon us and we shall abide by its rules and regulations,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cFor those who have not registered, or are hesitant to take the vaccine, we urge you to register because unvaccinated individuals can serve as a reservoir for the virus to mutate,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cVaccination provides immunity and has been largely protecting us even against the newer variants. Vaccination also protects us from requiring hospitalisation or contracting severe Covid-19,\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother benefit of vaccination is that it is more economical compared to the cost of quarantine, loss of income, and repeated testing. Vaccination may be our best exit strategy of returning to normalcy, so we are determined to be part of this programme, regardless of challenges.\u201d\n\nTo know more about Columbia Asia\u2019s Covid-19 initiatives, log onto the Covid-19 information page on the Columbia Asia website.", "keyword": ["vaccination", "sites", "hospital", "bintulu", "vaccines", "assigned", "taiping", "hospitals", "columbia", "appointment", "covid19", "vaccine"], "summary": "The eight Columbia Asia vaccination centres are located in Bintulu, Iskandar Puteri, Miri, Setapak, Puchong, Seremban, Taiping and Tebrau.\nColumbia Asia has been proactive in registering its hospitals as vaccination centres as part of the PICK campaign.\nNevertheless, we are determined to fight this pandemic together with the nation by helping the country to speed up the Covid-19 vaccination campaign,\u201d said Dr Sharonpal Singh, Columbia Asia Regional Emergency Services Coordinator.\nFor example, in Bintulu, Columbia Asia Bintulu and Petronas worked together to set up an industrial vaccine centre at Kidurong Club in Bintulu.\nThe latest to participate in the vaccination campaign is Columbia Asia Taiping, which became the eighth hospital to offer vaccinations.", "news": "CodeBlue", "date": "2021-07-19 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Malaysia\u2019s economic fundamentals still strong, supported by stable capital market, liquidity", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVib3JuZW9wb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA3LzI4L21hbGF5c2lhcy1lY29ub21pYy1mdW5kYW1lbnRhbHMtc3RpbGwtc3Ryb25nLXN1cHBvcnRlZC1ieS1zdGFibGUtY2FwaXRhbC1tYXJrZXQtbGlxdWlkaXR5L9IBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2021/03/lead1-MALAYSIA-ECON-p1.jpg", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR, July 28 (Bernama) \u2014 Malaysia\u2019s economic fundamentals are still strong and its growth prospect for the medium term is still bright, supported by a stable capital market, while the financial sector has ample liquidity and capital buffer, said Finance Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz.\n\nHe said among the issues raised by the Members of Parliament during the Special Parliament Meeting were whether the investors\u2019 confidence was affected following the Covid-19 pandemic in the country.\n\n\u201cA brief answer, no.

financial results from Ping Petroleum Ltd and SilTerra Malaysia Sdn Bhd.\n\nGroup MD Tan Sri Syed Zainal Abidin Syed Mohamed Tahir (picture) said with the oil price currently hovering above US$70 (RM295) per barrel, coupled with its enlarged shareholding of 90% in Ping, he foresees a significant improvement in revenue and profit contribution from Ping moving forward.\n\n\u201cThere is opportunity to further improve Ping\u2019s production output by rejuvenating existing wells to monetise economically attractive reserves in the Anasuria Cluster.\n\n\u201cWe are also looking into acquiring additional late cycle producing target markets as the North Sea, Malaysia and within the region as well,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve.\n\nOn June 30, DNeX equity stake in Ping rose to 90%, following the completion of the acquisition for an additional 60% stake in the upstream oil and gas player, valued at US$78 million.\n\nDNeX recorded a total revenue of RM284.6 million for the cumulative 15-month period ended March 31, 2021.\n\nOf that, the information technology and e-services segment represented RM197.8 million or 69.5%, whereas the energy segment contributed the balance RM86.8 million or 30.5%.\n\nAs at Ping\u2019s latest financial year ended Dec 31, 2020 (FY20), Ping recorded a total profit after tax of RM9.3 million on the back of RM142.4 million in revenue.\n\nHe said Ping had managed to stay profitable and generated positive operating cashflows during the year.\n\n\u201cIn relation to SilTerra, given the bullish outlook for the semiconductor sector today, where demand firmly outstrips supply and is expected to persist up to 2024, we are confident our business in the semiconductor market will grow at a strong pace.\n\n\u201cThe growing adoption of technology such as the Internet of Things, 5G, artificial intelligence and electric vehicles will continue to drive up demand for chips,\u201d Syed Zainal Abidin noted.\n\nHe added that the group has received a three-year contract extension for the National Single Window for Trade Facilitation concession up until 2024 which will continue to provide positive earnings.\n\n\u201cIt is expected to be a key contributor to our financial performance in our trade facilitation segment moving forward, contributing a revenue of about RM100 million a year,\u201d he said.\n\nThe contract extension also serves as a testament to DNeX\u2019s strength and capabilities as a leading e-services provider in trade facilitation.\n\nDNeX will continue to pursue opportunities in digitalisation among the public and private sectors in the country, he added.\n\nDNeX has secured a three-year contract with further three-year option for extension to supply installation and maintenance support services of submarine cable communications with PT Infrastruktur Telekomunikasi Indonesia (TelkomInfra).\n\nUnder the agreement, TelkomInfra will pay a standby charge of 213 billion rupiah (RM63 million) over the initial three-year period, excluding daily rates applicable depending on the work scope.\n\n\u201cWith an assumption of 65% vessel utilisation rate in a year, estimated total revenue per year, including standby charge, is about 215 billion rupiah.\n\n\n\n\u201cThus, revenue for the initial three years of contract can reach up to RM186 million, and RM372 million with the additional three-year option,\u201d he added.\n\nOn DNeX plans to raise RM642 million, Syed Zainal Abidin said the duration of the timeframe for the implementation of this exercise hinges on the take-up rate of the group\u2019s placement shares.\n\nThe exercise may be implemented in multiple tranches within six months from the date of approval of Bursa Securities or any extended period as may be approved by Bursa Securities, he explained.\n\n\u201cThe reason we opt for private placement is because it allows DNeX to bring in strategic investors which we can leverage for their track record and

Valuation expectations for the company stand between \u00a3150 million and \u00a3300 million for the former route, or between \u00a3300 million and \u00a3600 million for the latter. The ambitious plans would be a first for a crowdfunded business. Having grown rapidly over the past three years, Cheeky Panda sales leapt from \u00a3100,000 in 2017 to \u00a35.7 million last year, with a 200% jump in 2020. \u201cThe paper category has not been disrupted in decades,\u201d founder Chris Forbes told The Grocer. \u201cWe believe we can stand alone in the market against the big guys and become a mainstream player\u2026 We think we\u2019re being conservative with our forecasts. We\u2019re comfortable \u2013 because of the size of the category and where the consumer trends are \u2013 that we\u2019ll get to a market cap of \u00a31bn in five years.\u201d (VA)\n\nLegal radar:\n\nLorna Jane responds to fine for covid-19-related advertising claims \u2013 The Guardian reports that Lorna Jane, an activewear brand based in Australia, has been fined A$5 million for falsely claiming that items of its clothing range \u201celiminated\u201d and prevented the spread of covid-19. Specifically, advertisements claimed that its anti-virus activewear had been sprayed with a substance (LJ Shield) which protected people against pathogens, with copy stating: \u201cCure for the Spread of Covid-19? Lorna Jane Thinks So.\u201d The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) initiated legal action over the claims, with a federal judge subsequently stating that the company had sought to \u201cexploit the fear and concern\u201d surrounding the pandemic, adding: \u201cLorna Jane sought to profit from the fear with concerns of the public in a way that involves unlawful conduct in contravention of the relevant provisions of the Australian consumer law. The behaviour of Lorna Jane can only be described as exploitative, predatory and potentially dangerous.\u201d In a statement, the company said that it had been let down by a trusted supplier. Company CEO Bill Clarkson expanded: \u201cA trusted supplier sold us a product that did not perform as promised. They led us to believe the technology behind LJ Shield was being sold elsewhere in Australia, the USA, China, and Taiwan and that it was both anti-bacterial and anti-viral. We believed we were passing on a benefit to our customers at no extra cost to them.\u201d The incident came to light in July 2020. Clarkson added: \u201cIn the last 12 months we have reviewed the fundamentals of the production and marketing areas of our business, created new management roles in both teams and have now introduced an improved product testing regime so this cannot happen again.\u201d (TL)\n\nUS court rejects pre-emptive colour suit against Deutsche Telekom \u2013 The US District Court for the Northern District of California has rejected a case filed by San Francisco-based tech company Splunk Inc over its trademark rights in a colour gradient that includes Deutsche Telekom\u2019s signature magenta colour. Splunk filed the pre-emptive lawsuit seeking declaration that its use of a coral, magenta and orange colour gradient did not infringe the German telecoms company\u2019s US trademark rights in the colour magenta after receiving a cease and desist letter stating that the business \u201creserves its right\u201d to sue under US law. Despite similar action between the companies in Germany, the US court held that Splunk had \u201cfailed to demonstrate a reasonable apprehension of being sued in the United States\u201d, going so far as to state that the facts were \u201ca country mile\u201d from those necessary to establish jurisdiction. Neither company is out of the woods just yet though, as the court permitted Splunk to file an amended complaint to address the jurisdiction issues.

With no\n\nvisitors allowed to our brewery and our office staff all working from home, we have effectively created a workplace bubble comprised of essential workers who are critical for production operations only. This method has ensured zero workplace clusters, so with the added protection of 100% vaccinations, we are confident that we can operate safely,\u201d Roland added.\n\nHEINEKEN Malaysia is continuing its efforts to engage the Government on allowing brewers to resume operations, albeit at a scaled down level if necessary. According to the Confederation of Malaysian Brewers Berhad (CMBB), the impact of shutting down brewers is estimated to be at least RM200 million per month. In 2020, brewers contributed more than RM2 billion in taxes to the Government. However, under the current situation, no revenue can be generated for the Government.\n\nRoland commented, \u201cWe are ready to support the Government on accelerating Malaysia\u2019s recovery. With the economy and livelihoods at stake, we are prepared to help lessen the burden and inject much needed income to support the Government\u2019s revenue collection. Our impact also goes beyond direct tax contributions but through the supply, distribution, and retail of our products through over 35,000 local businesses in Malaysia. In a time when businesses in the food and beverage industry are struggling to survive, it is crucial that we ensure uninterrupted supply of products to the market to prevent any sudden shortages.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the curtailing of distribution of products deemed as non-essential by the authorities mean that finished goods stored in external warehouse are not allowed to be delivered to replenish depleting stock levels at retail outlets which are allowed to open, including supermarkets, convenience stores, grocery shops, restaurants, and coffee shops. We recommend that the distribution of finished goods be allowed, especially when the taxes on such products have already been paid in full to the Government. With breweries unable to operate and distribution not allowed, the market is expected to be depleted of stocks in the next three weeks. We are concerned that consumers may turn to illicit products that may be harmful to health.

The ongoing pandemic has impacted the country\u2019s economy, overburdened the healthcare system and virtually made prisoners of its residents for months.\n\nWalk-ins are a successful way to increase vaccination rates, as seen from the \u201cJab first, register later\u201d initiative in Kapit, Sarawak in June and the United States\u2019 walk-in vaccinations in pharmacies in May. To date, Malaysia has one of the fastest vaccination rates in the world with 1.35 doses administered per 100 people.\n\nActivists and community leaders have lauded the walk-in programme and expect it to mainly benefit migrants who are in the country legally with valid work permits but could not register for a vaccine under MySejahtera for some reason or other.\n\nFilipino community leader Liezl (not her real name) is relieved to know walk-ins would begin soon in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor as many members of her community have not been able to get their vaccine due to passport issues.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good especially for those who have passports that have already expired and still waiting (to renew their passports) since last year, ever since the pandemic began,\u201d she said, adding it would also help some of her stateless members.\n\nBut the same cannot be said for irregular migrants who include the undocumented, those who were documented but became undocumented as well as migrants who work under someone else\u2019s work permit.\n\nPublic health experts and civil society officials are concerned that the walk-in programme may not work as well for them, saying most migrants are leery of stepping foot into a vaccination centre as they still fear arrest and detention despite assurances of safe passage.\n\nOn Sunday, coordinating minister for the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme (Pick) Khairy Jamaluddin Abu Bakar announced that the guidelines to administer vaccines for migrants and refugees have been approved.\n\nHe added most of the vaccinations would be handled by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to reassure the migrants.\n\nImmigration Department director-general Datuk Khairul Dzaimee Daud promised a safe passage for them, telling Bernama via WhatsApp that \u201cimmigration will not interfere in (the) vaccination programme for migrants nor station its officials near the Covid-19 vaccination sites\u201d.\n\nMERCY Malaysia president Datuk Dr Ahmad Faizal Perdaus said walk-in vaccinations would be an ideal solution for irregular migrants and refugees as long as the groups, agencies and people responsible for allowing them into the PPV (vaccination centre) and administering the vaccine adhere to the assurance given by the Immigration Department director-general.\n\nHowever, he said governmental policy did not always translate well to the people on the ground, who may end up preventing some migrants and refugees from walking in to get their vaccine.\n\n\u201cThe proof will be in the pudding. And it will be in the eating of the pudding. Unfortunately, until it actually happens, we have no way of verifying (it is safe for migrants),\u201d he said.\n\nWhile walk-in vaccinations can do wonders to increase vaccination rates, experts and activists say the government should also start reaching out to irregular migrants and refugees through other methods.\n\nCurrently, the government\u2019s outreach programmes for the bedridden, the disabled and those living in rural areas include door-to-door and drive-through vaccinations, as well as the use of community centres as PPV and mobile vaccination sites. Currently, these initiatives only serve Malaysians.\n\nDr Ahmad Faizal said the government should not wait to include irregular migrants and refugees in the outreach programmes scheduled for Phase 4 of PICK.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should wait until that long. Because migrants are a reservoir of the virus. To a lesser extent, the refugee community,\u201d he said.\n\nNon-Malaysians are overrepresented in total infections. For instance, about 20 percent of infections recorded so far in July comprised non-citizens despite them being around 10 percent of the population overall.\n\nThere were about 1.7 million foreign workers in Malaysia in 2020, according to the Ministry of Human Resources. The International Organisation for Migration estimated that there was an additional two to four million irregular migrants in 2018. As of June this year, there were more than 179,000 refugees in Malaysia, according to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR).\n\nFounder and director of Our Journey Sumitha Shaanthinni Kishna said options other than walk-in vaccinations are also needed as many migrant workers are unlikely to avail of the initiative. Her group plans to provide a mobile vaccination site for migrants as soon as the Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) approves it.\n\n\u201c(They won\u2019t go into) government premises. For undocumented migrants, past experience has shown that it is very difficult (for them) to walk into government premises. For example, hospitals. The fear is there still (of being reported to Immigration),\u201d she said.\n\nThere are early signs that the walk-in programme may yet succeed, however.\n\nWhile many irregular migrants and refugees may be leery of walk-in vaccinations, some are willing to risk it if it means getting the vaccine sooner rather than later.\n\nAn undocumented migrant from Indonesia, who asked to be identified only as Surya, said his painless experience with the AstraZeneca opt-in programme made him encourage others to get their shot as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cI told them they should go get the shot for themselves. If we get the vaccine, we won\u2019t be so afraid. Yes, life and death are up to God but we must make the effort to be safe,\u201d he said. -Bernama", "keyword": ["migrants", "efforts", "outreach", "vaccination", "walkin", "good", "vaccinations", "work", "community", "analysis", "vaccine", "irregular", "walkins", "refugees", "begin", "programme", "reach"], "summary": "Vaccinating the millions of irregular migrants in Malaysia remains part of the country\u2019s plan to gain control of Covid-19 within its borders.\nBut the same cannot be said for irregular migrants who include the undocumented, those who were documented but became undocumented as well as migrants who work under someone else\u2019s work permit.\nDr Ahmad Faizal said the government should not wait to include irregular migrants and refugees in the outreach programmes scheduled for Phase 4 of PICK.\nThe International Organisation for Migration estimated that there was an additional two to four million irregular migrants in 2018.\nThere are early signs that the walk-in programme may yet succeed, however.", "news": "The Sun Daily", "date": "2021-07-30 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Food basket programme has its limitations, acknowledges minister", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWJvcm5lb3Bvc3QuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvMTkvZm9vZC1iYXNrZXQtcHJvZ3JhbW1lLWhhcy1pdHMtbGltaXRhdGlvbnMtYWNrbm93bGVkZ2VzLW1pbmlzdGVyL9IBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2021/07/kpt-bp-180721-jl-YB-Nanta.jpg", "text": "KAPIT (July 19): Minister of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Dato Sri Alexander Nanta Linggi acknowledges the limitation in the food basket programme under the People\u2019s Wellbeing and Economic Recovery Package (Pemulih).\n\nTaking his Kapit constituency as an example, he said the allocated RM300,000 for the programme would not be able to accommodate all 15,000 households across the parliamentary area.\n\n\u201cUnder the food basket programme, every parliamentary constituency \u2013 regardless of it being undereither the ruling coalition, or the opposition \u2013 is given RM300,000.\n\n\u201cUnder Kapit, there are three DUN (State Legislative Assembly) constituencies: Pelagus, Katibas and Bukit Goram; for each DUN area, I allocate RM100,000 for their respective food baskets.

This means that the government would need more manpower and resources.\n\nTo help the government achieve this target and the country to achieve herd immunity, Columbia Asia Group has volunteered to open up vaccination centres (PPV).\n\nColumbia Asia has been proactive in registering its hospitals as vaccination centres as part of the PICK campaign. This was carried out via applications submitted to ProtectHealth Corporation Sdn Bhd (ProtectHealth), a wholly-owned non-profit subsidiary of ProtectHealth Malaysia, established under the MOH.\n\n\u201cOur hospital setup is relatively small compared to other hospitals. Nevertheless, we are determined to fight this pandemic together with the nation by helping the country to speed up the Covid-19 vaccination campaign,\u201d said Dr Sharonpal Singh, Columbia Asia Regional Emergency Services Coordinator.\n\n\u201cOur hospital team designed and constructed viable workflows and organised dedicated rooms and space so we can serve our duty as a PPV,\u201d\n\nCurrently, Columbia Asia is working with the MOH through its eight branches that are functioning as vaccination centres, namely Bintulu, Iskandar Puteri, Miri, Setapak, Puchong, Seremban, Taiping and Tebrau.\n\nSome 160 on-ground Columbia Asia hospital staff have been assigned to man these urgent vaccination exercises across Selangor, Johor, Negeri Sembilan, Perak, Sarawak and Kuala Lumpur.\n\nThe number of vaccines allocated for each hospital depends on available resources such as space and manpower. Collectively, the eight Columbia Asia hospitals are capable of vaccinating 600 people a day.\n\nIn order to expedite the vaccine rollout, Columbia Asia has been formed collaborations with corporations.\n\nFor example, in Bintulu, Columbia Asia Bintulu and Petronas worked together to set up an industrial vaccine centre at Kidurong Club in Bintulu. Some 5,000 employees who are attached to oil and gas companies based in Bintulu will be vaccinated here. It commenced operations on July 5 and offers both Covid-19 tests as well as vaccinations.\n\nOther than Bintulu, Columbia Asia Miri also joined forces with health care company Qualitas to vaccinate oil and gas employees at the Petronas Carigali office in Lutong, Miri.\n\nColumbia Asia Miri was also the first PPV in the Columbia Asia group of hospitals to commence operations when they started vaccinations on May 25.\n\nThe latest to participate in the vaccination campaign is Columbia Asia Taiping, which became the eighth hospital to offer vaccinations. This came as a huge relief to Taiping residents, who previously had to rely on just one PPV.\n\nMedical officers at each hospital are on site to perform pre-vaccination assessment. They also carry out post-vaccination observations with the help of nurses. If any side effects should occur within the observation time, patients will be treated accordingly.\n\nIf patents develop symptoms after they have gone home and need treatment afterwards, they can choose to go back to the same hospital, or visit the nearest medical facility.\n\nEveryone should do their part in the fight against Covid-19 by registering with MySejahtera to be vaccinated.\n\nOnce an appointment is made, check the location of the vaccination centre and the date of the appointment. The number and list of vaccines are based on allocated slots prepared by the district health office (PKD). Vaccination venues will depend on where vacinees live.\n\n\u201cWe hope the public will not walk in without a MySejahtera appointment or try to make an appointment directly with our hospitals. Our hospitals will contact you prior to your appointment,\u201d said Dr Sharonpal.\n\n\u201cWe do not procure the vaccines ourselves. The Malaysian government is procuring the vaccines from manufacturers and appointing third party organisations to manage the vaccine distribution. The role of a PPV is entrusted upon us and we shall abide by its rules and regulations,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cFor those who have not registered, or are hesitant to take the vaccine, we urge you to register because unvaccinated individuals can serve as a reservoir for the virus to mutate,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cVaccination provides immunity and has been largely protecting us even against the newer variants. Vaccination also protects us from requiring hospitalisation or contracting severe Covid-19,\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother benefit of vaccination is that it is more economical compared to the cost of quarantine, loss of income, and repeated testing. Vaccination may be our best exit strategy of returning to normalcy, so we are determined to be part of this programme, regardless of challenges.\u201d\n\nTo know more about Columbia Asia\u2019s Covid-19 initiatives, log onto the Covid-19 information page on the Columbia Asia website.", "keyword": ["vaccination", "sites", "hospital", "bintulu", "vaccines", "assigned", "taiping", "hospitals", "columbia", "appointment", "covid19", "vaccine"], "summary": "The eight Columbia Asia vaccination centres are located in Bintulu, Iskandar Puteri, Miri, Setapak, Puchong, Seremban, Taiping and Tebrau.\nColumbia Asia has been proactive in registering its hospitals as vaccination centres as part of the PICK campaign.\nNevertheless, we are determined to fight this pandemic together with the nation by helping the country to speed up the Covid-19 vaccination campaign,\u201d said Dr Sharonpal Singh, Columbia Asia Regional Emergency Services Coordinator.\nFor example, in Bintulu, Columbia Asia Bintulu and Petronas worked together to set up an industrial vaccine centre at Kidurong Club in Bintulu.\nThe latest to participate in the vaccination campaign is Columbia Asia Taiping, which became the eighth hospital to offer vaccinations.", "news": "CodeBlue", "date": "2021-07-19 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Malaysia\u2019s economic fundamentals still strong, supported by stable capital market, liquidity", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVib3JuZW9wb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA3LzI4L21hbGF5c2lhcy1lY29ub21pYy1mdW5kYW1lbnRhbHMtc3RpbGwtc3Ryb25nLXN1cHBvcnRlZC1ieS1zdGFibGUtY2FwaXRhbC1tYXJrZXQtbGlxdWlkaXR5L9IBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2021/03/lead1-MALAYSIA-ECON-p1.jpg", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR, July 28 (Bernama) \u2014 Malaysia\u2019s economic fundamentals are still strong and its growth prospect for the medium term is still bright, supported by a stable capital market, while the financial sector has ample liquidity and capital buffer, said Finance Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz.\n\nHe said among the issues raised by the Members of Parliament during the Special Parliament Meeting were whether the investors\u2019 confidence was affected following the Covid-19 pandemic in the country.\n\n\u201cA brief answer, no.

The seizure, which took place over the weekend, involved a raid of three premises that sold various types of face mask. In this case, the suspected counterfeit goods are Neutrovis brand masks. \u201cWe believe that they are using the premises as a storage location and to carry out distribution activities of the seized face masks,\u201d a law enforcement spokesperson said, before confirming that the raid took place in cooperation with the trademark owner. \u201cThe Johor KPDNHEP will continue to work with trademark owners and other agencies in the effort to protect the rights of consumers and the intellectual property rights of the industry. Traders are also warned not to conduct transactions using fake trade descriptions or counterfeit goods because the Johor KPDNHEP is constantly monitoring and will take stern action against offenders.\u201d (TJL)\n\nEluceda completes \u00a31.1 million institutional fundraising \u2013 Authentication and detection solutions company Eluceda has completed a \u00a31.1 million institutional fundraising round.

According to The Grocer, the company \u2013 which sells bamboo-based toilet paper, kitchen roll, tissues and baby wipes across China, Europe, the Middle East and the United States \u2013 is working with KPMG on an IPO strategy and running a dual-track process, which includes plans to either float on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) (a sub-market of the London Stock Exchange designed to help smaller companies access capital from the public market) in 2022 or raise money in a private placing followed by a much bigger flotation on the main market a year or two later. Valuation expectations for the company stand between \u00a3150 million and \u00a3300 million for the former route, or between \u00a3300 million and \u00a3600 million for the latter. The ambitious plans would be a first for a crowdfunded business. Having grown rapidly over the past three years, Cheeky Panda sales leapt from \u00a3100,000 in 2017 to \u00a35.7 million last year, with a 200% jump in 2020. \u201cThe paper category has not been disrupted in decades,\u201d founder Chris Forbes told The Grocer. \u201cWe believe we can stand alone in the market against the big guys and become a mainstream player\u2026 We think we\u2019re being conservative with our forecasts. We\u2019re comfortable \u2013 because of the size of the category and where the consumer trends are \u2013 that we\u2019ll get to a market cap of \u00a31bn in five years.\u201d (VA)\n\nLegal radar:\n\nLorna Jane responds to fine for covid-19-related advertising claims \u2013 The Guardian reports that Lorna Jane, an activewear brand based in Australia, has been fined A$5 million for falsely claiming that items of its clothing range \u201celiminated\u201d and prevented the spread of covid-19. Specifically, advertisements claimed that its anti-virus activewear had been sprayed with a substance (LJ Shield) which protected people against pathogens, with copy stating: \u201cCure for the Spread of Covid-19? Lorna Jane Thinks So.\u201d The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) initiated legal action over the claims, with a federal judge subsequently stating that the company had sought to \u201cexploit the fear and concern\u201d surrounding the pandemic, adding: \u201cLorna Jane sought to profit from the fear with concerns of the public in a way that involves unlawful conduct in contravention of the relevant provisions of the Australian consumer law. The behaviour of Lorna Jane can only be described as exploitative, predatory and potentially dangerous.\u201d In a statement, the company said that it had been let down by a trusted supplier. Company CEO Bill Clarkson expanded: \u201cA trusted supplier sold us a product that did not perform as promised. They led us to believe the technology behind LJ Shield was being sold elsewhere in Australia, the USA, China, and Taiwan and that it was both anti-bacterial and anti-viral. We believed we were passing on a benefit to our customers at no extra cost to them.\u201d The incident came to light in July 2020. Clarkson added: \u201cIn the last 12 months we have reviewed the fundamentals of the production and marketing areas of our business, created new management roles in both teams and have now introduced an improved product testing regime so this cannot happen again.\u201d (TL)\n\nUS court rejects pre-emptive colour suit against Deutsche Telekom \u2013 The US District Court for the Northern District of California has rejected a case filed by San Francisco-based tech company Splunk Inc over its trademark rights in a colour gradient that includes Deutsche Telekom\u2019s signature magenta colour. Splunk filed the pre-emptive lawsuit seeking declaration that its use of a coral, magenta and orange colour gradient did not infringe the German telecoms company\u2019s US trademark rights in the colour magenta after receiving a cease and desist letter stating that the business \u201creserves its right\u201d to sue under US law. Despite similar action between the companies in Germany, the US court held that Splunk had \u201cfailed to demonstrate a reasonable apprehension of being sued in the United States\u201d, going so far as to state that the facts were \u201ca country mile\u201d from those necessary to establish jurisdiction. Neither company is out of the woods just yet though, as the court permitted Splunk to file an amended complaint to address the jurisdiction issues.

This will be done via its new arm, the F&B division, launched today in a virtual media conference.\n\nIn light of the Covid-19 pandemic, MRCA immediate past president and chief of F&B division Datuk Seri Garry Chua highlighted that the F&B division will lobby the government for extension and improvement to the Covid-19 Act and to protect and preserve retail businesses affected by the various Movement Control Orders (MCOs), for fair charges by delivery platforms and anti-competitive behaviour, for dine-in for vaccinated patrons as soon as possible, for business recovery funding for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and for government-initiated mediation on outstanding rent issues between landlords and tenants during the MCO.\n\n\u201cMRCA\u2019s F&B members are expected to gain invaluable opportunities to raise business-related issues and gain unhindered access to first-hand information from the authorities that would greatly benefit their respective businesses by leveraging on cordial relationships with various government bodies relevant to F&B operations including the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP), Human Resources Development Fund (HRDF) and Pertubuhan Keselamatan Sosial (Perkeso),\u201d said Chua.\n\nMeanwhile, the new F&B division aims to represent the voice and plight of F&B retailers with six main objectives.\n\n\u201cThese include to form a body of retailers specialising in the F&B industry among MRCA members to assist and support each other in matters of business; to arrange training, programmes, social and business networking events for its members to encourage and foster collaboration, goodwill and better understanding; to equip its members with the right skills, information and training to expand and develop their businesses particularly in the F&B industry; to promote and advance the professional development of the F&B division in the retail chain business and franchise industry; to assist and support the association in achieving and/or attaining its objectives; and any other matters that are incidental or conducive,\u201d said Chua.\n\nAlso present at the virtual conference were Tourism, Arts and Culture Minister Datuk Seri Nancy Shukri, MRCA president Shirley Tay, MRCA vice president and deputy chief of F&B division Valerie Choo and MRCA F&B division treasurer Datuk Kenneth Soh.\n\n\u201cThis new division will be a concrete and formidable platform for MRCA members, not just to assist and support each other, but also to expand the business network to foster more collaboration, goodwill, and understanding. It will also benefit entrepreneurs in developing local businesses and attract more F&B brand participation, which will ultimately increase economic activities to ensure viable long-term benefits to stakeholders within the industry,\u201d said Nancy.\n\nShe added that the F&B division is timely right now and is in line with one of their strategies, which is to enhance demand sophistication by increasing tourist experiences that are unique, differentiated and memorable. Therefore, it is important to increase the value of services and goods provided to tourists.\n\nIn anticipation of a business rebound post-pandemic, the F&B division should organise relevant workshops and training to ensure its members are well prepared to adapt to the new consumer trend and behaviour in the future.\n\n\u201cWe will provide members with knowledge and techniques to improve their operational efficiency, as well as an opportunity for expansion through franchising.

Over the next two weeks, all staff required to work on-site at HEINEKEN Malaysia\u2019s Sungei Way Brewery in Petaling Jaya are scheduled to receive their second dose of the vaccine through the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme (PICK), the Public-Private Partnership Covid-19 Industry Immunisation Programme (PIKAS), or the AstraZeneca Voluntary Opt-in Programme.\n\nFor employees based outside of Kuala Lumpur and Selangor, the Company will secure their vaccination through the Selangor Covid-19 Vaccination Programme (SelVAX) designated panel clinics nationwide.\n\nRoland Bala, Managing Director of HEINEKEN Malaysia, commented: \u201cWe commend the Government on its efforts to accelerate vaccinations through various programmes. We are thankful for the efficient roll-out of PIKAS by Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which has enabled 100% of our brewery\u2019s essential workforce to receive their first dose of the vaccine last week. HEINEKEN Malaysia is committed to protecting the health and safety of our workers, getting our staff vaccinated is a big step towards ensuring we are well prepared to resume operations as soon as we can.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt HEINEKEN Malaysia, we have been implementing a rigorous process to proactively screen for and prevent the spread of Covid-19 at the workplace. Besides fully complying with all required SOPs by the Government, we test all on-site employees and contractors on a bi-weekly basis. Our operations are highly automated, thus requiring only a minimal number of workers to handle systems and machines on our a 23.72-acre site and allowing physical distancing of at least 10 metres between operators. With no\n\nvisitors allowed to our brewery and our office staff all working from home, we have effectively created a workplace bubble comprised of essential workers who are critical for production operations only. This method has ensured zero workplace clusters, so with the added protection of 100% vaccinations, we are confident that we can operate safely,\u201d Roland added.\n\nHEINEKEN Malaysia is continuing its efforts to engage the Government on allowing brewers to resume operations, albeit at a scaled down level if necessary. According to the Confederation of Malaysian Brewers Berhad (CMBB), the impact of shutting down brewers is estimated to be at least RM200 million per month. In 2020, brewers contributed more than RM2 billion in taxes to the Government. However, under the current situation, no revenue can be generated for the Government.\n\nRoland commented, \u201cWe are ready to support the Government on accelerating Malaysia\u2019s recovery. With the economy and livelihoods at stake, we are prepared to help lessen the burden and inject much needed income to support the Government\u2019s revenue collection. Our impact also goes beyond direct tax contributions but through the supply, distribution, and retail of our products through over 35,000 local businesses in Malaysia. In a time when businesses in the food and beverage industry are struggling to survive, it is crucial that we ensure uninterrupted supply of products to the market to prevent any sudden shortages.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the curtailing of distribution of products deemed as non-essential by the authorities mean that finished goods stored in external warehouse are not allowed to be delivered to replenish depleting stock levels at retail outlets which are allowed to open, including supermarkets, convenience stores, grocery shops, restaurants, and coffee shops. We recommend that the distribution of finished goods be allowed, especially when the taxes on such products have already been paid in full to the Government. With breweries unable to operate and distribution not allowed, the market is expected to be depleted of stocks in the next three weeks. We are concerned that consumers may turn to illicit products that may be harmful to health.

The ongoing pandemic has impacted the country\u2019s economy, overburdened the healthcare system and virtually made prisoners of its residents for months.\n\nWalk-ins are a successful way to increase vaccination rates, as seen from the \u201cJab first, register later\u201d initiative in Kapit, Sarawak in June and the United States\u2019 walk-in vaccinations in pharmacies in May. To date, Malaysia has one of the fastest vaccination rates in the world with 1.35 doses administered per 100 people.\n\nActivists and community leaders have lauded the walk-in programme and expect it to mainly benefit migrants who are in the country legally with valid work permits but could not register for a vaccine under MySejahtera for some reason or other.\n\nFilipino community leader Liezl (not her real name) is relieved to know walk-ins would begin soon in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor as many members of her community have not been able to get their vaccine due to passport issues.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good especially for those who have passports that have already expired and still waiting (to renew their passports) since last year, ever since the pandemic began,\u201d she said, adding it would also help some of her stateless members.\n\nBut the same cannot be said for irregular migrants who include the undocumented, those who were documented but became undocumented as well as migrants who work under someone else\u2019s work permit.\n\nPublic health experts and civil society officials are concerned that the walk-in programme may not work as well for them, saying most migrants are leery of stepping foot into a vaccination centre as they still fear arrest and detention despite assurances of safe passage.\n\nOn Sunday, coordinating minister for the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme (Pick) Khairy Jamaluddin Abu Bakar announced that the guidelines to administer vaccines for migrants and refugees have been approved.\n\nHe added most of the vaccinations would be handled by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to reassure the migrants.\n\nImmigration Department director-general Datuk Khairul Dzaimee Daud promised a safe passage for them, telling Bernama via WhatsApp that \u201cimmigration will not interfere in (the) vaccination programme for migrants nor station its officials near the Covid-19 vaccination sites\u201d.\n\nMERCY Malaysia president Datuk Dr Ahmad Faizal Perdaus said walk-in vaccinations would be an ideal solution for irregular migrants and refugees as long as the groups, agencies and people responsible for allowing them into the PPV (vaccination centre) and administering the vaccine adhere to the assurance given by the Immigration Department director-general.\n\nHowever, he said governmental policy did not always translate well to the people on the ground, who may end up preventing some migrants and refugees from walking in to get their vaccine.\n\n\u201cThe proof will be in the pudding. And it will be in the eating of the pudding. Unfortunately, until it actually happens, we have no way of verifying (it is safe for migrants),\u201d he said.\n\nWhile walk-in vaccinations can do wonders to increase vaccination rates, experts and activists say the government should also start reaching out to irregular migrants and refugees through other methods.\n\nCurrently, the government\u2019s outreach programmes for the bedridden, the disabled and those living in rural areas include door-to-door and drive-through vaccinations, as well as the use of community centres as PPV and mobile vaccination sites. Currently, these initiatives only serve Malaysians.\n\nDr Ahmad Faizal said the government should not wait to include irregular migrants and refugees in the outreach programmes scheduled for Phase 4 of PICK.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should wait until that long. Because migrants are a reservoir of the virus. To a lesser extent, the refugee community,\u201d he said.\n\nNon-Malaysians are overrepresented in total infections. For instance, about 20 percent of infections recorded so far in July comprised non-citizens despite them being around 10 percent of the population overall.\n\nThere were about 1.7 million foreign workers in Malaysia in 2020, according to the Ministry of Human Resources. The International Organisation for Migration estimated that there was an additional two to four million irregular migrants in 2018. As of June this year, there were more than 179,000 refugees in Malaysia, according to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR).\n\nFounder and director of Our Journey Sumitha Shaanthinni Kishna said options other than walk-in vaccinations are also needed as many migrant workers are unlikely to avail of the initiative. Her group plans to provide a mobile vaccination site for migrants as soon as the Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) approves it.\n\n\u201c(They won\u2019t go into) government premises. For undocumented migrants, past experience has shown that it is very difficult (for them) to walk into government premises. For example, hospitals. The fear is there still (of being reported to Immigration),\u201d she said.\n\nThere are early signs that the walk-in programme may yet succeed, however.\n\nWhile many irregular migrants and refugees may be leery of walk-in vaccinations, some are willing to risk it if it means getting the vaccine sooner rather than later.\n\nAn undocumented migrant from Indonesia, who asked to be identified only as Surya, said his painless experience with the AstraZeneca opt-in programme made him encourage others to get their shot as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cI told them they should go get the shot for themselves. If we get the vaccine, we won\u2019t be so afraid. Yes, life and death are up to God but we must make the effort to be safe,\u201d he said. -Bernama", "keyword": ["migrants", "efforts", "outreach", "vaccination", "walkin", "good", "vaccinations", "work", "community", "analysis", "vaccine", "irregular", "walkins", "refugees", "begin", "programme", "reach"], "summary": "Vaccinating the millions of irregular migrants in Malaysia remains part of the country\u2019s plan to gain control of Covid-19 within its borders.\nBut the same cannot be said for irregular migrants who include the undocumented, those who were documented but became undocumented as well as migrants who work under someone else\u2019s work permit.\nDr Ahmad Faizal said the government should not wait to include irregular migrants and refugees in the outreach programmes scheduled for Phase 4 of PICK.\nThe International Organisation for Migration estimated that there was an additional two to four million irregular migrants in 2018.\nThere are early signs that the walk-in programme may yet succeed, however.", "news": "The Sun Daily", "date": "2021-07-30 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Food basket programme has its limitations, acknowledges minister", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWJvcm5lb3Bvc3QuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvMTkvZm9vZC1iYXNrZXQtcHJvZ3JhbW1lLWhhcy1pdHMtbGltaXRhdGlvbnMtYWNrbm93bGVkZ2VzLW1pbmlzdGVyL9IBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2021/07/kpt-bp-180721-jl-YB-Nanta.jpg", "text": "KAPIT (July 19): Minister of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Dato Sri Alexander Nanta Linggi acknowledges the limitation in the food basket programme under the People\u2019s Wellbeing and Economic Recovery Package (Pemulih).\n\nTaking his Kapit constituency as an example, he said the allocated RM300,000 for the programme would not be able to accommodate all 15,000 households across the parliamentary area.\n\n\u201cUnder the food basket programme, every parliamentary constituency \u2013 regardless of it being undereither the ruling coalition, or the opposition \u2013 is given RM300,000.\n\n\u201cUnder Kapit, there are three DUN (State Legislative Assembly) constituencies: Pelagus, Katibas and Bukit Goram; for each DUN area, I allocate RM100,000 for their respective food baskets.

This means that the government would need more manpower and resources.\n\nTo help the government achieve this target and the country to achieve herd immunity, Columbia Asia Group has volunteered to open up vaccination centres (PPV).\n\nColumbia Asia has been proactive in registering its hospitals as vaccination centres as part of the PICK campaign. This was carried out via applications submitted to ProtectHealth Corporation Sdn Bhd (ProtectHealth), a wholly-owned non-profit subsidiary of ProtectHealth Malaysia, established under the MOH.\n\n\u201cOur hospital setup is relatively small compared to other hospitals. Nevertheless, we are determined to fight this pandemic together with the nation by helping the country to speed up the Covid-19 vaccination campaign,\u201d said Dr Sharonpal Singh, Columbia Asia Regional Emergency Services Coordinator.\n\n\u201cOur hospital team designed and constructed viable workflows and organised dedicated rooms and space so we can serve our duty as a PPV,\u201d\n\nCurrently, Columbia Asia is working with the MOH through its eight branches that are functioning as vaccination centres, namely Bintulu, Iskandar Puteri, Miri, Setapak, Puchong, Seremban, Taiping and Tebrau.\n\nSome 160 on-ground Columbia Asia hospital staff have been assigned to man these urgent vaccination exercises across Selangor, Johor, Negeri Sembilan, Perak, Sarawak and Kuala Lumpur.\n\nThe number of vaccines allocated for each hospital depends on available resources such as space and manpower. Collectively, the eight Columbia Asia hospitals are capable of vaccinating 600 people a day.\n\nIn order to expedite the vaccine rollout, Columbia Asia has been formed collaborations with corporations.\n\nFor example, in Bintulu, Columbia Asia Bintulu and Petronas worked together to set up an industrial vaccine centre at Kidurong Club in Bintulu. Some 5,000 employees who are attached to oil and gas companies based in Bintulu will be vaccinated here. It commenced operations on July 5 and offers both Covid-19 tests as well as vaccinations.\n\nOther than Bintulu, Columbia Asia Miri also joined forces with health care company Qualitas to vaccinate oil and gas employees at the Petronas Carigali office in Lutong, Miri.\n\nColumbia Asia Miri was also the first PPV in the Columbia Asia group of hospitals to commence operations when they started vaccinations on May 25.\n\nThe latest to participate in the vaccination campaign is Columbia Asia Taiping, which became the eighth hospital to offer vaccinations. This came as a huge relief to Taiping residents, who previously had to rely on just one PPV.\n\nMedical officers at each hospital are on site to perform pre-vaccination assessment. They also carry out post-vaccination observations with the help of nurses. If any side effects should occur within the observation time, patients will be treated accordingly.\n\nIf patents develop symptoms after they have gone home and need treatment afterwards, they can choose to go back to the same hospital, or visit the nearest medical facility.\n\nEveryone should do their part in the fight against Covid-19 by registering with MySejahtera to be vaccinated.\n\nOnce an appointment is made, check the location of the vaccination centre and the date of the appointment. The number and list of vaccines are based on allocated slots prepared by the district health office (PKD). Vaccination venues will depend on where vacinees live.\n\n\u201cWe hope the public will not walk in without a MySejahtera appointment or try to make an appointment directly with our hospitals. Our hospitals will contact you prior to your appointment,\u201d said Dr Sharonpal.\n\n\u201cWe do not procure the vaccines ourselves. The Malaysian government is procuring the vaccines from manufacturers and appointing third party organisations to manage the vaccine distribution. The role of a PPV is entrusted upon us and we shall abide by its rules and regulations,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cFor those who have not registered, or are hesitant to take the vaccine, we urge you to register because unvaccinated individuals can serve as a reservoir for the virus to mutate,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cVaccination provides immunity and has been largely protecting us even against the newer variants. Vaccination also protects us from requiring hospitalisation or contracting severe Covid-19,\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother benefit of vaccination is that it is more economical compared to the cost of quarantine, loss of income, and repeated testing. Vaccination may be our best exit strategy of returning to normalcy, so we are determined to be part of this programme, regardless of challenges.\u201d\n\nTo know more about Columbia Asia\u2019s Covid-19 initiatives, log onto the Covid-19 information page on the Columbia Asia website.", "keyword": ["vaccination", "sites", "hospital", "bintulu", "vaccines", "assigned", "taiping", "hospitals", "columbia", "appointment", "covid19", "vaccine"], "summary": "The eight Columbia Asia vaccination centres are located in Bintulu, Iskandar Puteri, Miri, Setapak, Puchong, Seremban, Taiping and Tebrau.\nColumbia Asia has been proactive in registering its hospitals as vaccination centres as part of the PICK campaign.\nNevertheless, we are determined to fight this pandemic together with the nation by helping the country to speed up the Covid-19 vaccination campaign,\u201d said Dr Sharonpal Singh, Columbia Asia Regional Emergency Services Coordinator.\nFor example, in Bintulu, Columbia Asia Bintulu and Petronas worked together to set up an industrial vaccine centre at Kidurong Club in Bintulu.\nThe latest to participate in the vaccination campaign is Columbia Asia Taiping, which became the eighth hospital to offer vaccinations.", "news": "CodeBlue", "date": "2021-07-19 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Malaysia\u2019s economic fundamentals still strong, supported by stable capital market, liquidity", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVib3JuZW9wb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA3LzI4L21hbGF5c2lhcy1lY29ub21pYy1mdW5kYW1lbnRhbHMtc3RpbGwtc3Ryb25nLXN1cHBvcnRlZC1ieS1zdGFibGUtY2FwaXRhbC1tYXJrZXQtbGlxdWlkaXR5L9IBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2021/03/lead1-MALAYSIA-ECON-p1.jpg", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR, July 28 (Bernama) \u2014 Malaysia\u2019s economic fundamentals are still strong and its growth prospect for the medium term is still bright, supported by a stable capital market, while the financial sector has ample liquidity and capital buffer, said Finance Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz.\n\nHe said among the issues raised by the Members of Parliament during the Special Parliament Meeting were whether the investors\u2019 confidence was affected following the Covid-19 pandemic in the country.\n\n\u201cA brief answer, no.

private sectors in the country\n\nby NUR HANANI AZMAN / Pic by TMR FILE PIX\n\nDAGANG NeXchange Bhd (DNeX) expects the group financial performance moving forward will improve with the consolidation of financial results from Ping Petroleum Ltd and SilTerra Malaysia Sdn Bhd.\n\nGroup MD Tan Sri Syed Zainal Abidin Syed Mohamed Tahir (picture) said with the oil price currently hovering above US$70 (RM295) per barrel, coupled with its enlarged shareholding of 90% in Ping, he foresees a significant improvement in revenue and profit contribution from Ping moving forward.\n\n\u201cThere is opportunity to further improve Ping\u2019s production output by rejuvenating existing wells to monetise economically attractive reserves in the Anasuria Cluster.\n\n\u201cWe are also looking into acquiring additional late cycle producing target markets as the North Sea, Malaysia and within the region as well,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve.\n\nOn June 30, DNeX equity stake in Ping rose to 90%, following the completion of the acquisition for an additional 60% stake in the upstream oil and gas player, valued at US$78 million.\n\nDNeX recorded a total revenue of RM284.6 million for the cumulative 15-month period ended March 31, 2021.\n\nOf that, the information technology and e-services segment represented RM197.8 million or 69.5%, whereas the energy segment contributed the balance RM86.8 million or 30.5%.\n\nAs at Ping\u2019s latest financial year ended Dec 31, 2020 (FY20), Ping recorded a total profit after tax of RM9.3 million on the back of RM142.4 million in revenue.\n\nHe said Ping had managed to stay profitable and generated positive operating cashflows during the year.\n\n\u201cIn relation to SilTerra, given the bullish outlook for the semiconductor sector today, where demand firmly outstrips supply and is expected to persist up to 2024, we are confident our business in the semiconductor market will grow at a strong pace.\n\n\u201cThe growing adoption of technology such as the Internet of Things, 5G, artificial intelligence and electric vehicles will continue to drive up demand for chips,\u201d Syed Zainal Abidin noted.\n\nHe added that the group has received a three-year contract extension for the National Single Window for Trade Facilitation concession up until 2024 which will continue to provide positive earnings.\n\n\u201cIt is expected to be a key contributor to our financial performance in our trade facilitation segment moving forward, contributing a revenue of about RM100 million a year,\u201d he said.\n\nThe contract extension also serves as a testament to DNeX\u2019s strength and capabilities as a leading e-services provider in trade facilitation.\n\nDNeX will continue to pursue opportunities in digitalisation among the public and private sectors in the country, he added.\n\nDNeX has secured a three-year contract with further three-year option for extension to supply installation and maintenance support services of submarine cable communications with PT Infrastruktur Telekomunikasi Indonesia (TelkomInfra).\n\nUnder the agreement, TelkomInfra will pay a standby charge of 213 billion rupiah (RM63 million) over the initial three-year period, excluding daily rates applicable depending on the work scope.\n\n\u201cWith an assumption of 65% vessel utilisation rate in a year, estimated total revenue per year, including standby charge, is about 215 billion rupiah.\n\n\n\n\u201cThus, revenue for the initial three years of contract can reach up to RM186 million, and RM372 million with the additional three-year option,\u201d he added.\n\nOn DNeX plans to raise RM642 million, Syed Zainal Abidin said the duration of the timeframe for the implementation of this exercise hinges on the take-up rate of the group\u2019s placement shares.\n\nThe exercise may be implemented in multiple tranches within six months from the date of approval of Bursa Securities or any extended period as may be approved by Bursa Securities, he explained.\n\n\u201cThe reason we opt for private placement is because it allows DNeX to bring in strategic investors which we can leverage for their track record and capabilities, to add value to our business and fuel our future growth.

According to The Grocer, the company \u2013 which sells bamboo-based toilet paper, kitchen roll, tissues and baby wipes across China, Europe, the Middle East and the United States \u2013 is working with KPMG on an IPO strategy and running a dual-track process, which includes plans to either float on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) (a sub-market of the London Stock Exchange designed to help smaller companies access capital from the public market) in 2022 or raise money in a private placing followed by a much bigger flotation on the main market a year or two later. Valuation expectations for the company stand between \u00a3150 million and \u00a3300 million for the former route, or between \u00a3300 million and \u00a3600 million for the latter. The ambitious plans would be a first for a crowdfunded business.

Specifically, advertisements claimed that its anti-virus activewear had been sprayed with a substance (LJ Shield) which protected people against pathogens, with copy stating: \u201cCure for the Spread of Covid-19? Lorna Jane Thinks So.\u201d The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) initiated legal action over the claims, with a federal judge subsequently stating that the company had sought to \u201cexploit the fear and concern\u201d surrounding the pandemic, adding: \u201cLorna Jane sought to profit from the fear with concerns of the public in a way that involves unlawful conduct in contravention of the relevant provisions of the Australian consumer law. The behaviour of Lorna Jane can only be described as exploitative, predatory and potentially dangerous.\u201d In a statement, the company said that it had been let down by a trusted supplier. Company CEO Bill Clarkson expanded: \u201cA trusted supplier sold us a product that did not perform as promised. They led us to believe the technology behind LJ Shield was being sold elsewhere in Australia, the USA, China, and Taiwan and that it was both anti-bacterial and anti-viral. We believed we were passing on a benefit to our customers at no extra cost to them.\u201d The incident came to light in July 2020. Clarkson added: \u201cIn the last 12 months we have reviewed the fundamentals of the production and marketing areas of our business, created new management roles in both teams and have now introduced an improved product testing regime so this cannot happen again.\u201d (TL)\n\nUS court rejects pre-emptive colour suit against Deutsche Telekom \u2013 The US District Court for the Northern District of California has rejected a case filed by San Francisco-based tech company Splunk Inc over its trademark rights in a colour gradient that includes Deutsche Telekom\u2019s signature magenta colour. Splunk filed the pre-emptive lawsuit seeking declaration that its use of a coral, magenta and orange colour gradient did not infringe the German telecoms company\u2019s US trademark rights in the colour magenta after receiving a cease and desist letter stating that the business \u201creserves its right\u201d to sue under US law. Despite similar action between the companies in Germany, the US court held that Splunk had \u201cfailed to demonstrate a reasonable apprehension of being sued in the United States\u201d, going so far as to state that the facts were \u201ca country mile\u201d from those necessary to establish jurisdiction. Neither company is out of the woods just yet though, as the court permitted Splunk to file an amended complaint to address the jurisdiction issues.

This will be done via its new arm, the F&B division, launched today in a virtual media conference.\n\nIn light of the Covid-19 pandemic, MRCA immediate past president and chief of F&B division Datuk Seri Garry Chua highlighted that the F&B division will lobby the government for extension and improvement to the Covid-19 Act and to protect and preserve retail businesses affected by the various Movement Control Orders (MCOs), for fair charges by delivery platforms and anti-competitive behaviour, for dine-in for vaccinated patrons as soon as possible, for business recovery funding for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and for government-initiated mediation on outstanding rent issues between landlords and tenants during the MCO.\n\n\u201cMRCA\u2019s F&B members are expected to gain invaluable opportunities to raise business-related issues and gain unhindered access to first-hand information from the authorities that would greatly benefit their respective businesses by leveraging on cordial relationships with various government bodies relevant to F&B operations including the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP), Human Resources Development Fund (HRDF) and Pertubuhan Keselamatan Sosial (Perkeso),\u201d said Chua.\n\nMeanwhile, the new F&B division aims to represent the voice and plight of F&B retailers with six main objectives.\n\n\u201cThese include to form a body of retailers specialising in the F&B industry among MRCA members to assist and support each other in matters of business; to arrange training, programmes, social and business networking events for its members to encourage and foster collaboration, goodwill and better understanding; to equip its members with the right skills, information and training to expand and develop their businesses particularly in the F&B industry; to promote and advance the professional development of the F&B division in the retail chain business and franchise industry; to assist and support the association in achieving and/or attaining its objectives; and any other matters that are incidental or conducive,\u201d said Chua.\n\nAlso present at the virtual conference were Tourism, Arts and Culture Minister Datuk Seri Nancy Shukri, MRCA president Shirley Tay, MRCA vice president and deputy chief of F&B division Valerie Choo and MRCA F&B division treasurer Datuk Kenneth Soh.\n\n\u201cThis new division will be a concrete and formidable platform for MRCA members, not just to assist and support each other, but also to expand the business network to foster more collaboration, goodwill, and understanding. It will also benefit entrepreneurs in developing local businesses and attract more F&B brand participation, which will ultimately increase economic activities to ensure viable long-term benefits to stakeholders within the industry,\u201d said Nancy.\n\nShe added that the F&B division is timely right now and is in line with one of their strategies, which is to enhance demand sophistication by increasing tourist experiences that are unique, differentiated and memorable. Therefore, it is important to increase the value of services and goods provided to tourists.\n\nIn anticipation of a business rebound post-pandemic, the F&B division should organise relevant workshops and training to ensure its members are well prepared to adapt to the new consumer trend and behaviour in the future.\n\n\u201cWe will provide members with knowledge and techniques to improve their operational efficiency, as well as an opportunity for expansion through franchising.

Over the next two weeks, all staff required to work on-site at HEINEKEN Malaysia\u2019s Sungei Way Brewery in Petaling Jaya are scheduled to receive their second dose of the vaccine through the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme (PICK), the Public-Private Partnership Covid-19 Industry Immunisation Programme (PIKAS), or the AstraZeneca Voluntary Opt-in Programme.\n\nFor employees based outside of Kuala Lumpur and Selangor, the Company will secure their vaccination through the Selangor Covid-19 Vaccination Programme (SelVAX) designated panel clinics nationwide.\n\nRoland Bala, Managing Director of HEINEKEN Malaysia, commented: \u201cWe commend the Government on its efforts to accelerate vaccinations through various programmes. We are thankful for the efficient roll-out of PIKAS by Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which has enabled 100% of our brewery\u2019s essential workforce to receive their first dose of the vaccine last week. HEINEKEN Malaysia is committed to protecting the health and safety of our workers, getting our staff vaccinated is a big step towards ensuring we are well prepared to resume operations as soon as we can.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt HEINEKEN Malaysia, we have been implementing a rigorous process to proactively screen for and prevent the spread of Covid-19 at the workplace. Besides fully complying with all required SOPs by the Government, we test all on-site employees and contractors on a bi-weekly basis. Our operations are highly automated, thus requiring only a minimal number of workers to handle systems and machines on our a 23.72-acre site and allowing physical distancing of at least 10 metres between operators. With no\n\nvisitors allowed to our brewery and our office staff all working from home, we have effectively created a workplace bubble comprised of essential workers who are critical for production operations only. This method has ensured zero workplace clusters, so with the added protection of 100% vaccinations, we are confident that we can operate safely,\u201d Roland added.\n\nHEINEKEN Malaysia is continuing its efforts to engage the Government on allowing brewers to resume operations, albeit at a scaled down level if necessary. According to the Confederation of Malaysian Brewers Berhad (CMBB), the impact of shutting down brewers is estimated to be at least RM200 million per month. In 2020, brewers contributed more than RM2 billion in taxes to the Government. However, under the current situation, no revenue can be generated for the Government.\n\nRoland commented, \u201cWe are ready to support the Government on accelerating Malaysia\u2019s recovery. With the economy and livelihoods at stake, we are prepared to help lessen the burden and inject much needed income to support the Government\u2019s revenue collection. Our impact also goes beyond direct tax contributions but through the supply, distribution, and retail of our products through over 35,000 local businesses in Malaysia. In a time when businesses in the food and beverage industry are struggling to survive, it is crucial that we ensure uninterrupted supply of products to the market to prevent any sudden shortages.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the curtailing of distribution of products deemed as non-essential by the authorities mean that finished goods stored in external warehouse are not allowed to be delivered to replenish depleting stock levels at retail outlets which are allowed to open, including supermarkets, convenience stores, grocery shops, restaurants, and coffee shops. We recommend that the distribution of finished goods be allowed, especially when the taxes on such products have already been paid in full to the Government. With breweries unable to operate and distribution not allowed, the market is expected to be depleted of stocks in the next three weeks.

The ongoing pandemic has impacted the country\u2019s economy, overburdened the healthcare system and virtually made prisoners of its residents for months.\n\nWalk-ins are a successful way to increase vaccination rates, as seen from the \u201cJab first, register later\u201d initiative in Kapit, Sarawak in June and the United States\u2019 walk-in vaccinations in pharmacies in May. To date, Malaysia has one of the fastest vaccination rates in the world with 1.35 doses administered per 100 people.\n\nActivists and community leaders have lauded the walk-in programme and expect it to mainly benefit migrants who are in the country legally with valid work permits but could not register for a vaccine under MySejahtera for some reason or other.\n\nFilipino community leader Liezl (not her real name) is relieved to know walk-ins would begin soon in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor as many members of her community have not been able to get their vaccine due to passport issues.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good especially for those who have passports that have already expired and still waiting (to renew their passports) since last year, ever since the pandemic began,\u201d she said, adding it would also help some of her stateless members.\n\nBut the same cannot be said for irregular migrants who include the undocumented, those who were documented but became undocumented as well as migrants who work under someone else\u2019s work permit.\n\nPublic health experts and civil society officials are concerned that the walk-in programme may not work as well for them, saying most migrants are leery of stepping foot into a vaccination centre as they still fear arrest and detention despite assurances of safe passage.\n\nOn Sunday, coordinating minister for the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme (Pick) Khairy Jamaluddin Abu Bakar announced that the guidelines to administer vaccines for migrants and refugees have been approved.\n\nHe added most of the vaccinations would be handled by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to reassure the migrants.\n\nImmigration Department director-general Datuk Khairul Dzaimee Daud promised a safe passage for them, telling Bernama via WhatsApp that \u201cimmigration will not interfere in (the) vaccination programme for migrants nor station its officials near the Covid-19 vaccination sites\u201d.\n\nMERCY Malaysia president Datuk Dr Ahmad Faizal Perdaus said walk-in vaccinations would be an ideal solution for irregular migrants and refugees as long as the groups, agencies and people responsible for allowing them into the PPV (vaccination centre) and administering the vaccine adhere to the assurance given by the Immigration Department director-general.\n\nHowever, he said governmental policy did not always translate well to the people on the ground, who may end up preventing some migrants and refugees from walking in to get their vaccine.\n\n\u201cThe proof will be in the pudding. And it will be in the eating of the pudding. Unfortunately, until it actually happens, we have no way of verifying (it is safe for migrants),\u201d he said.\n\nWhile walk-in vaccinations can do wonders to increase vaccination rates, experts and activists say the government should also start reaching out to irregular migrants and refugees through other methods.\n\nCurrently, the government\u2019s outreach programmes for the bedridden, the disabled and those living in rural areas include door-to-door and drive-through vaccinations, as well as the use of community centres as PPV and mobile vaccination sites. Currently, these initiatives only serve Malaysians.\n\nDr Ahmad Faizal said the government should not wait to include irregular migrants and refugees in the outreach programmes scheduled for Phase 4 of PICK.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should wait until that long. Because migrants are a reservoir of the virus. To a lesser extent, the refugee community,\u201d he said.\n\nNon-Malaysians are overrepresented in total infections. For instance, about 20 percent of infections recorded so far in July comprised non-citizens despite them being around 10 percent of the population overall.\n\nThere were about 1.7 million foreign workers in Malaysia in 2020, according to the Ministry of Human Resources. The International Organisation for Migration estimated that there was an additional two to four million irregular migrants in 2018. As of June this year, there were more than 179,000 refugees in Malaysia, according to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR).\n\nFounder and director of Our Journey Sumitha Shaanthinni Kishna said options other than walk-in vaccinations are also needed as many migrant workers are unlikely to avail of the initiative. Her group plans to provide a mobile vaccination site for migrants as soon as the Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) approves it.\n\n\u201c(They won\u2019t go into) government premises. For undocumented migrants, past experience has shown that it is very difficult (for them) to walk into government premises. For example, hospitals. The fear is there still (of being reported to Immigration),\u201d she said.\n\nThere are early signs that the walk-in programme may yet succeed, however.\n\nWhile many irregular migrants and refugees may be leery of walk-in vaccinations, some are willing to risk it if it means getting the vaccine sooner rather than later.\n\nAn undocumented migrant from Indonesia, who asked to be identified only as Surya, said his painless experience with the AstraZeneca opt-in programme made him encourage others to get their shot as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cI told them they should go get the shot for themselves. If we get the vaccine, we won\u2019t be so afraid. Yes, life and death are up to God but we must make the effort to be safe,\u201d he said. -Bernama", "keyword": ["migrants", "efforts", "outreach", "vaccination", "walkin", "good", "vaccinations", "work", "community", "analysis", "vaccine", "irregular", "walkins", "refugees", "begin", "programme", "reach"], "summary": "Vaccinating the millions of irregular migrants in Malaysia remains part of the country\u2019s plan to gain control of Covid-19 within its borders.\nBut the same cannot be said for irregular migrants who include the undocumented, those who were documented but became undocumented as well as migrants who work under someone else\u2019s work permit.\nDr Ahmad Faizal said the government should not wait to include irregular migrants and refugees in the outreach programmes scheduled for Phase 4 of PICK.\nThe International Organisation for Migration estimated that there was an additional two to four million irregular migrants in 2018.\nThere are early signs that the walk-in programme may yet succeed, however.", "news": "The Sun Daily", "date": "2021-07-30 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Food basket programme has its limitations, acknowledges minister", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWJvcm5lb3Bvc3QuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvMTkvZm9vZC1iYXNrZXQtcHJvZ3JhbW1lLWhhcy1pdHMtbGltaXRhdGlvbnMtYWNrbm93bGVkZ2VzLW1pbmlzdGVyL9IBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2021/07/kpt-bp-180721-jl-YB-Nanta.jpg", "text": "KAPIT (July 19): Minister of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Dato Sri Alexander Nanta Linggi acknowledges the limitation in the food basket programme under the People\u2019s Wellbeing and Economic Recovery Package (Pemulih).\n\nTaking his Kapit constituency as an example, he said the allocated RM300,000 for the programme would not be able to accommodate all 15,000 households across the parliamentary area.\n\n\u201cUnder the food basket programme, every parliamentary constituency \u2013 regardless of it being undereither the ruling coalition, or the opposition \u2013 is given RM300,000.\n\n\u201cUnder Kapit, there are three DUN (State Legislative Assembly) constituencies: Pelagus, Katibas and Bukit Goram; for each DUN area, I allocate RM100,000 for their respective food baskets.

This means that the government would need more manpower and resources.\n\nTo help the government achieve this target and the country to achieve herd immunity, Columbia Asia Group has volunteered to open up vaccination centres (PPV).\n\nColumbia Asia has been proactive in registering its hospitals as vaccination centres as part of the PICK campaign. This was carried out via applications submitted to ProtectHealth Corporation Sdn Bhd (ProtectHealth), a wholly-owned non-profit subsidiary of ProtectHealth Malaysia, established under the MOH.\n\n\u201cOur hospital setup is relatively small compared to other hospitals. Nevertheless, we are determined to fight this pandemic together with the nation by helping the country to speed up the Covid-19 vaccination campaign,\u201d said Dr Sharonpal Singh, Columbia Asia Regional Emergency Services Coordinator.\n\n\u201cOur hospital team designed and constructed viable workflows and organised dedicated rooms and space so we can serve our duty as a PPV,\u201d\n\nCurrently, Columbia Asia is working with the MOH through its eight branches that are functioning as vaccination centres, namely Bintulu, Iskandar Puteri, Miri, Setapak, Puchong, Seremban, Taiping and Tebrau.\n\nSome 160 on-ground Columbia Asia hospital staff have been assigned to man these urgent vaccination exercises across Selangor, Johor, Negeri Sembilan, Perak, Sarawak and Kuala Lumpur.\n\nThe number of vaccines allocated for each hospital depends on available resources such as space and manpower. Collectively, the eight Columbia Asia hospitals are capable of vaccinating 600 people a day.\n\nIn order to expedite the vaccine rollout, Columbia Asia has been formed collaborations with corporations.\n\nFor example, in Bintulu, Columbia Asia Bintulu and Petronas worked together to set up an industrial vaccine centre at Kidurong Club in Bintulu. Some 5,000 employees who are attached to oil and gas companies based in Bintulu will be vaccinated here. It commenced operations on July 5 and offers both Covid-19 tests as well as vaccinations.\n\nOther than Bintulu, Columbia Asia Miri also joined forces with health care company Qualitas to vaccinate oil and gas employees at the Petronas Carigali office in Lutong, Miri.\n\nColumbia Asia Miri was also the first PPV in the Columbia Asia group of hospitals to commence operations when they started vaccinations on May 25.\n\nThe latest to participate in the vaccination campaign is Columbia Asia Taiping, which became the eighth hospital to offer vaccinations. This came as a huge relief to Taiping residents, who previously had to rely on just one PPV.\n\nMedical officers at each hospital are on site to perform pre-vaccination assessment. They also carry out post-vaccination observations with the help of nurses. If any side effects should occur within the observation time, patients will be treated accordingly.\n\nIf patents develop symptoms after they have gone home and need treatment afterwards, they can choose to go back to the same hospital, or visit the nearest medical facility.\n\nEveryone should do their part in the fight against Covid-19 by registering with MySejahtera to be vaccinated.\n\nOnce an appointment is made, check the location of the vaccination centre and the date of the appointment. The number and list of vaccines are based on allocated slots prepared by the district health office (PKD). Vaccination venues will depend on where vacinees live.\n\n\u201cWe hope the public will not walk in without a MySejahtera appointment or try to make an appointment directly with our hospitals. Our hospitals will contact you prior to your appointment,\u201d said Dr Sharonpal.\n\n\u201cWe do not procure the vaccines ourselves. The Malaysian government is procuring the vaccines from manufacturers and appointing third party organisations to manage the vaccine distribution. The role of a PPV is entrusted upon us and we shall abide by its rules and regulations,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cFor those who have not registered, or are hesitant to take the vaccine, we urge you to register because unvaccinated individuals can serve as a reservoir for the virus to mutate,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cVaccination provides immunity and has been largely protecting us even against the newer variants. Vaccination also protects us from requiring hospitalisation or contracting severe Covid-19,\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother benefit of vaccination is that it is more economical compared to the cost of quarantine, loss of income, and repeated testing. Vaccination may be our best exit strategy of returning to normalcy, so we are determined to be part of this programme, regardless of challenges.\u201d\n\nTo know more about Columbia Asia\u2019s Covid-19 initiatives, log onto the Covid-19 information page on the Columbia Asia website.", "keyword": ["vaccination", "sites", "hospital", "bintulu", "vaccines", "assigned", "taiping", "hospitals", "columbia", "appointment", "covid19", "vaccine"], "summary": "The eight Columbia Asia vaccination centres are located in Bintulu, Iskandar Puteri, Miri, Setapak, Puchong, Seremban, Taiping and Tebrau.\nColumbia Asia has been proactive in registering its hospitals as vaccination centres as part of the PICK campaign.\nNevertheless, we are determined to fight this pandemic together with the nation by helping the country to speed up the Covid-19 vaccination campaign,\u201d said Dr Sharonpal Singh, Columbia Asia Regional Emergency Services Coordinator.\nFor example, in Bintulu, Columbia Asia Bintulu and Petronas worked together to set up an industrial vaccine centre at Kidurong Club in Bintulu.\nThe latest to participate in the vaccination campaign is Columbia Asia Taiping, which became the eighth hospital to offer vaccinations.", "news": "CodeBlue", "date": "2021-07-19 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Malaysia\u2019s economic fundamentals still strong, supported by stable capital market, liquidity", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVib3JuZW9wb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA3LzI4L21hbGF5c2lhcy1lY29ub21pYy1mdW5kYW1lbnRhbHMtc3RpbGwtc3Ryb25nLXN1cHBvcnRlZC1ieS1zdGFibGUtY2FwaXRhbC1tYXJrZXQtbGlxdWlkaXR5L9IBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2021/03/lead1-MALAYSIA-ECON-p1.jpg", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR, July 28 (Bernama) \u2014 Malaysia\u2019s economic fundamentals are still strong and its growth prospect for the medium term is still bright, supported by a stable capital market, while the financial sector has ample liquidity and capital buffer, said Finance Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz.\n\nHe said among the issues raised by the Members of Parliament during the Special Parliament Meeting were whether the investors\u2019 confidence was affected following the Covid-19 pandemic in the country.\n\n\u201cA brief answer, no.

Valuation expectations for the company stand between \u00a3150 million and \u00a3300 million for the former route, or between \u00a3300 million and \u00a3600 million for the latter. The ambitious plans would be a first for a crowdfunded business. Having grown rapidly over the past three years, Cheeky Panda sales leapt from \u00a3100,000 in 2017 to \u00a35.7 million last year, with a 200% jump in 2020. \u201cThe paper category has not been disrupted in decades,\u201d founder Chris Forbes told The Grocer. \u201cWe believe we can stand alone in the market against the big guys and become a mainstream player\u2026 We think we\u2019re being conservative with our forecasts. We\u2019re comfortable \u2013 because of the size of the category and where the consumer trends are \u2013 that we\u2019ll get to a market cap of \u00a31bn in five years.\u201d (VA)\n\nLegal radar:\n\nLorna Jane responds to fine for covid-19-related advertising claims \u2013 The Guardian reports that Lorna Jane, an activewear brand based in Australia, has been fined A$5 million for falsely claiming that items of its clothing range \u201celiminated\u201d and prevented the spread of covid-19. Specifically, advertisements claimed that its anti-virus activewear had been sprayed with a substance (LJ Shield) which protected people against pathogens, with copy stating: \u201cCure for the Spread of Covid-19? Lorna Jane Thinks So.\u201d The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) initiated legal action over the claims, with a federal judge subsequently stating that the company had sought to \u201cexploit the fear and concern\u201d surrounding the pandemic, adding: \u201cLorna Jane sought to profit from the fear with concerns of the public in a way that involves unlawful conduct in contravention of the relevant provisions of the Australian consumer law. The behaviour of Lorna Jane can only be described as exploitative, predatory and potentially dangerous.\u201d In a statement, the company said that it had been let down by a trusted supplier. Company CEO Bill Clarkson expanded: \u201cA trusted supplier sold us a product that did not perform as promised. They led us to believe the technology behind LJ Shield was being sold elsewhere in Australia, the USA, China, and Taiwan and that it was both anti-bacterial and anti-viral. We believed we were passing on a benefit to our customers at no extra cost to them.\u201d The incident came to light in July 2020. Clarkson added: \u201cIn the last 12 months we have reviewed the fundamentals of the production and marketing areas of our business, created new management roles in both teams and have now introduced an improved product testing regime so this cannot happen again.\u201d (TL)\n\nUS court rejects pre-emptive colour suit against Deutsche Telekom \u2013 The US District Court for the Northern District of California has rejected a case filed by San Francisco-based tech company Splunk Inc over its trademark rights in a colour gradient that includes Deutsche Telekom\u2019s signature magenta colour. Splunk filed the pre-emptive lawsuit seeking declaration that its use of a coral, magenta and orange colour gradient did not infringe the German telecoms company\u2019s US trademark rights in the colour magenta after receiving a cease and desist letter stating that the business \u201creserves its right\u201d to sue under US law. Despite similar action between the companies in Germany, the US court held that Splunk had \u201cfailed to demonstrate a reasonable apprehension of being sued in the United States\u201d, going so far as to state that the facts were \u201ca country mile\u201d from those necessary to establish jurisdiction. Neither company is out of the woods just yet though, as the court permitted Splunk to file an amended complaint to address the jurisdiction issues.

With no\n\nvisitors allowed to our brewery and our office staff all working from home, we have effectively created a workplace bubble comprised of essential workers who are critical for production operations only. This method has ensured zero workplace clusters, so with the added protection of 100% vaccinations, we are confident that we can operate safely,\u201d Roland added.\n\nHEINEKEN Malaysia is continuing its efforts to engage the Government on allowing brewers to resume operations, albeit at a scaled down level if necessary. According to the Confederation of Malaysian Brewers Berhad (CMBB), the impact of shutting down brewers is estimated to be at least RM200 million per month. In 2020, brewers contributed more than RM2 billion in taxes to the Government. However, under the current situation, no revenue can be generated for the Government.\n\nRoland commented, \u201cWe are ready to support the Government on accelerating Malaysia\u2019s recovery. With the economy and livelihoods at stake, we are prepared to help lessen the burden and inject much needed income to support the Government\u2019s revenue collection. Our impact also goes beyond direct tax contributions but through the supply, distribution, and retail of our products through over 35,000 local businesses in Malaysia. In a time when businesses in the food and beverage industry are struggling to survive, it is crucial that we ensure uninterrupted supply of products to the market to prevent any sudden shortages.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the curtailing of distribution of products deemed as non-essential by the authorities mean that finished goods stored in external warehouse are not allowed to be delivered to replenish depleting stock levels at retail outlets which are allowed to open, including supermarkets, convenience stores, grocery shops, restaurants, and coffee shops. We recommend that the distribution of finished goods be allowed, especially when the taxes on such products have already been paid in full to the Government. With breweries unable to operate and distribution not allowed, the market is expected to be depleted of stocks in the next three weeks. We are concerned that consumers may turn to illicit products that may be harmful to health.

The ongoing pandemic has impacted the country\u2019s economy, overburdened the healthcare system and virtually made prisoners of its residents for months.\n\nWalk-ins are a successful way to increase vaccination rates, as seen from the \u201cJab first, register later\u201d initiative in Kapit, Sarawak in June and the United States\u2019 walk-in vaccinations in pharmacies in May. To date, Malaysia has one of the fastest vaccination rates in the world with 1.35 doses administered per 100 people.\n\nActivists and community leaders have lauded the walk-in programme and expect it to mainly benefit migrants who are in the country legally with valid work permits but could not register for a vaccine under MySejahtera for some reason or other.\n\nFilipino community leader Liezl (not her real name) is relieved to know walk-ins would begin soon in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor as many members of her community have not been able to get their vaccine due to passport issues.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good especially for those who have passports that have already expired and still waiting (to renew their passports) since last year, ever since the pandemic began,\u201d she said, adding it would also help some of her stateless members.\n\nBut the same cannot be said for irregular migrants who include the undocumented, those who were documented but became undocumented as well as migrants who work under someone else\u2019s work permit.\n\nPublic health experts and civil society officials are concerned that the walk-in programme may not work as well for them, saying most migrants are leery of stepping foot into a vaccination centre as they still fear arrest and detention despite assurances of safe passage.\n\nOn Sunday, coordinating minister for the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme (Pick) Khairy Jamaluddin Abu Bakar announced that the guidelines to administer vaccines for migrants and refugees have been approved.\n\nHe added most of the vaccinations would be handled by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to reassure the migrants.\n\nImmigration Department director-general Datuk Khairul Dzaimee Daud promised a safe passage for them, telling Bernama via WhatsApp that \u201cimmigration will not interfere in (the) vaccination programme for migrants nor station its officials near the Covid-19 vaccination sites\u201d.\n\nMERCY Malaysia president Datuk Dr Ahmad Faizal Perdaus said walk-in vaccinations would be an ideal solution for irregular migrants and refugees as long as the groups, agencies and people responsible for allowing them into the PPV (vaccination centre) and administering the vaccine adhere to the assurance given by the Immigration Department director-general.\n\nHowever, he said governmental policy did not always translate well to the people on the ground, who may end up preventing some migrants and refugees from walking in to get their vaccine.\n\n\u201cThe proof will be in the pudding. And it will be in the eating of the pudding. Unfortunately, until it actually happens, we have no way of verifying (it is safe for migrants),\u201d he said.\n\nWhile walk-in vaccinations can do wonders to increase vaccination rates, experts and activists say the government should also start reaching out to irregular migrants and refugees through other methods.\n\nCurrently, the government\u2019s outreach programmes for the bedridden, the disabled and those living in rural areas include door-to-door and drive-through vaccinations, as well as the use of community centres as PPV and mobile vaccination sites. Currently, these initiatives only serve Malaysians.\n\nDr Ahmad Faizal said the government should not wait to include irregular migrants and refugees in the outreach programmes scheduled for Phase 4 of PICK.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should wait until that long. Because migrants are a reservoir of the virus. To a lesser extent, the refugee community,\u201d he said.\n\nNon-Malaysians are overrepresented in total infections. For instance, about 20 percent of infections recorded so far in July comprised non-citizens despite them being around 10 percent of the population overall.\n\nThere were about 1.7 million foreign workers in Malaysia in 2020, according to the Ministry of Human Resources. The International Organisation for Migration estimated that there was an additional two to four million irregular migrants in 2018. As of June this year, there were more than 179,000 refugees in Malaysia, according to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR).\n\nFounder and director of Our Journey Sumitha Shaanthinni Kishna said options other than walk-in vaccinations are also needed as many migrant workers are unlikely to avail of the initiative. Her group plans to provide a mobile vaccination site for migrants as soon as the Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) approves it.\n\n\u201c(They won\u2019t go into) government premises. For undocumented migrants, past experience has shown that it is very difficult (for them) to walk into government premises. For example, hospitals. The fear is there still (of being reported to Immigration),\u201d she said.\n\nThere are early signs that the walk-in programme may yet succeed, however.\n\nWhile many irregular migrants and refugees may be leery of walk-in vaccinations, some are willing to risk it if it means getting the vaccine sooner rather than later.\n\nAn undocumented migrant from Indonesia, who asked to be identified only as Surya, said his painless experience with the AstraZeneca opt-in programme made him encourage others to get their shot as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cI told them they should go get the shot for themselves. If we get the vaccine, we won\u2019t be so afraid. Yes, life and death are up to God but we must make the effort to be safe,\u201d he said. -Bernama", "keyword": ["migrants", "efforts", "outreach", "vaccination", "walkin", "good", "vaccinations", "work", "community", "analysis", "vaccine", "irregular", "walkins", "refugees", "begin", "programme", "reach"], "summary": "Vaccinating the millions of irregular migrants in Malaysia remains part of the country\u2019s plan to gain control of Covid-19 within its borders.\nBut the same cannot be said for irregular migrants who include the undocumented, those who were documented but became undocumented as well as migrants who work under someone else\u2019s work permit.\nDr Ahmad Faizal said the government should not wait to include irregular migrants and refugees in the outreach programmes scheduled for Phase 4 of PICK.\nThe International Organisation for Migration estimated that there was an additional two to four million irregular migrants in 2018.\nThere are early signs that the walk-in programme may yet succeed, however.", "news": "The Sun Daily", "date": "2021-07-30 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Food basket programme has its limitations, acknowledges minister", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWJvcm5lb3Bvc3QuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvMTkvZm9vZC1iYXNrZXQtcHJvZ3JhbW1lLWhhcy1pdHMtbGltaXRhdGlvbnMtYWNrbm93bGVkZ2VzLW1pbmlzdGVyL9IBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2021/07/kpt-bp-180721-jl-YB-Nanta.jpg", "text": "KAPIT (July 19): Minister of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Dato Sri Alexander Nanta Linggi acknowledges the limitation in the food basket programme under the People\u2019s Wellbeing and Economic Recovery Package (Pemulih).\n\nTaking his Kapit constituency as an example, he said the allocated RM300,000 for the programme would not be able to accommodate all 15,000 households across the parliamentary area.\n\n\u201cUnder the food basket programme, every parliamentary constituency \u2013 regardless of it being undereither the ruling coalition, or the opposition \u2013 is given RM300,000.\n\n\u201cUnder Kapit, there are three DUN (State Legislative Assembly) constituencies: Pelagus, Katibas and Bukit Goram; for each DUN area, I allocate RM100,000 for their respective food baskets.

This means that the government would need more manpower and resources.\n\nTo help the government achieve this target and the country to achieve herd immunity, Columbia Asia Group has volunteered to open up vaccination centres (PPV).\n\nColumbia Asia has been proactive in registering its hospitals as vaccination centres as part of the PICK campaign. This was carried out via applications submitted to ProtectHealth Corporation Sdn Bhd (ProtectHealth), a wholly-owned non-profit subsidiary of ProtectHealth Malaysia, established under the MOH.\n\n\u201cOur hospital setup is relatively small compared to other hospitals. Nevertheless, we are determined to fight this pandemic together with the nation by helping the country to speed up the Covid-19 vaccination campaign,\u201d said Dr Sharonpal Singh, Columbia Asia Regional Emergency Services Coordinator.\n\n\u201cOur hospital team designed and constructed viable workflows and organised dedicated rooms and space so we can serve our duty as a PPV,\u201d\n\nCurrently, Columbia Asia is working with the MOH through its eight branches that are functioning as vaccination centres, namely Bintulu, Iskandar Puteri, Miri, Setapak, Puchong, Seremban, Taiping and Tebrau.\n\nSome 160 on-ground Columbia Asia hospital staff have been assigned to man these urgent vaccination exercises across Selangor, Johor, Negeri Sembilan, Perak, Sarawak and Kuala Lumpur.\n\nThe number of vaccines allocated for each hospital depends on available resources such as space and manpower. Collectively, the eight Columbia Asia hospitals are capable of vaccinating 600 people a day.\n\nIn order to expedite the vaccine rollout, Columbia Asia has been formed collaborations with corporations.\n\nFor example, in Bintulu, Columbia Asia Bintulu and Petronas worked together to set up an industrial vaccine centre at Kidurong Club in Bintulu. Some 5,000 employees who are attached to oil and gas companies based in Bintulu will be vaccinated here. It commenced operations on July 5 and offers both Covid-19 tests as well as vaccinations.\n\nOther than Bintulu, Columbia Asia Miri also joined forces with health care company Qualitas to vaccinate oil and gas employees at the Petronas Carigali office in Lutong, Miri.\n\nColumbia Asia Miri was also the first PPV in the Columbia Asia group of hospitals to commence operations when they started vaccinations on May 25.\n\nThe latest to participate in the vaccination campaign is Columbia Asia Taiping, which became the eighth hospital to offer vaccinations. This came as a huge relief to Taiping residents, who previously had to rely on just one PPV.\n\nMedical officers at each hospital are on site to perform pre-vaccination assessment. They also carry out post-vaccination observations with the help of nurses. If any side effects should occur within the observation time, patients will be treated accordingly.\n\nIf patents develop symptoms after they have gone home and need treatment afterwards, they can choose to go back to the same hospital, or visit the nearest medical facility.\n\nEveryone should do their part in the fight against Covid-19 by registering with MySejahtera to be vaccinated.\n\nOnce an appointment is made, check the location of the vaccination centre and the date of the appointment. The number and list of vaccines are based on allocated slots prepared by the district health office (PKD). Vaccination venues will depend on where vacinees live.\n\n\u201cWe hope the public will not walk in without a MySejahtera appointment or try to make an appointment directly with our hospitals. Our hospitals will contact you prior to your appointment,\u201d said Dr Sharonpal.\n\n\u201cWe do not procure the vaccines ourselves. The Malaysian government is procuring the vaccines from manufacturers and appointing third party organisations to manage the vaccine distribution. The role of a PPV is entrusted upon us and we shall abide by its rules and regulations,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cFor those who have not registered, or are hesitant to take the vaccine, we urge you to register because unvaccinated individuals can serve as a reservoir for the virus to mutate,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cVaccination provides immunity and has been largely protecting us even against the newer variants. Vaccination also protects us from requiring hospitalisation or contracting severe Covid-19,\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother benefit of vaccination is that it is more economical compared to the cost of quarantine, loss of income, and repeated testing. Vaccination may be our best exit strategy of returning to normalcy, so we are determined to be part of this programme, regardless of challenges.\u201d\n\nTo know more about Columbia Asia\u2019s Covid-19 initiatives, log onto the Covid-19 information page on the Columbia Asia website.", "keyword": ["vaccination", "sites", "hospital", "bintulu", "vaccines", "assigned", "taiping", "hospitals", "columbia", "appointment", "covid19", "vaccine"], "summary": "The eight Columbia Asia vaccination centres are located in Bintulu, Iskandar Puteri, Miri, Setapak, Puchong, Seremban, Taiping and Tebrau.\nColumbia Asia has been proactive in registering its hospitals as vaccination centres as part of the PICK campaign.\nNevertheless, we are determined to fight this pandemic together with the nation by helping the country to speed up the Covid-19 vaccination campaign,\u201d said Dr Sharonpal Singh, Columbia Asia Regional Emergency Services Coordinator.\nFor example, in Bintulu, Columbia Asia Bintulu and Petronas worked together to set up an industrial vaccine centre at Kidurong Club in Bintulu.\nThe latest to participate in the vaccination campaign is Columbia Asia Taiping, which became the eighth hospital to offer vaccinations.", "news": "CodeBlue", "date": "2021-07-19 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Malaysia\u2019s economic fundamentals still strong, supported by stable capital market, liquidity", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVib3JuZW9wb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA3LzI4L21hbGF5c2lhcy1lY29ub21pYy1mdW5kYW1lbnRhbHMtc3RpbGwtc3Ryb25nLXN1cHBvcnRlZC1ieS1zdGFibGUtY2FwaXRhbC1tYXJrZXQtbGlxdWlkaXR5L9IBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2021/03/lead1-MALAYSIA-ECON-p1.jpg", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR, July 28 (Bernama) \u2014 Malaysia\u2019s economic fundamentals are still strong and its growth prospect for the medium term is still bright, supported by a stable capital market, while the financial sector has ample liquidity and capital buffer, said Finance Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz.\n\nHe said among the issues raised by the Members of Parliament during the Special Parliament Meeting were whether the investors\u2019 confidence was affected following the Covid-19 pandemic in the country.\n\n\u201cA brief answer, no.

including standby charge, is about 215 billion rupiah.\n\n\n\n\u201cThus, revenue for the initial three years of contract can reach up to RM186 million, and RM372 million with the additional three-year option,\u201d he added.\n\nOn DNeX plans to raise RM642 million, Syed Zainal Abidin said the duration of the timeframe for the implementation of this exercise hinges on the take-up rate of the group\u2019s placement shares.\n\nThe exercise may be implemented in multiple tranches within six months from the date of approval of Bursa Securities or any extended period as may be approved by Bursa Securities, he explained.\n\n\u201cThe reason we opt for private placement is because it allows DNeX to bring in strategic investors which we can leverage for their track record and capabilities, to add value to our business and fuel our future growth.
