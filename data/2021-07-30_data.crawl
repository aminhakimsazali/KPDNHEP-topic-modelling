Covid jabs per day and are moving towards increasing to 20,000 doses per day. \u2014 Picture by Sayuti Zainudin\n\nFollow us on Instagram and subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates.\n\nGEORGE TOWN, Aug 1 \u2014 Factories and small businesses in Penang, especially those hard hit by disruptions due to the Covid-19 pandemic, are looking forward to resuming operations as soon as possible even if it means making vaccination mandatory for their workers.\n\nAs there are currently no laws to enforce mandatory Covid-19 vaccination on workers, some companies are taking steps to get their workers to register for vaccination.\n\nPenang Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM) chairman Datuk Jimmy Ong said most factories here are encouraging their workers to register for their Covid jabs through various methods.\n\n\u201cSome companies are giving paid leave to their workers to go for vaccination and some are even offering monetary rewards,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the main reason multinational companies (MNC) are setting up Program Imunisasi Industri Covid-19 Kerjasama Awam-Swasta (Pikas) vaccination centres within their own factory grounds is to encourage their workers to get vaccinated.\n\nHe said the Pikas PPVs in Penang are now dispensing 15,000 doses per day and are moving towards increasing to 20,000 doses per day.\n\nHe said the vaccination of workers in MNCs is progressing very fast due to the on-site PPVs for larger factories which employ thousands of workers.\n\n\u201cIt is slower for small medium enterprises as they can only send their workers to the Pikas PPVs and there are only two of those now; one in Jawi and one at Equatorial Hotel,\u201d he said.\n\nEven with vaccination in full force, Ong said some of the companies in the manufacturing sector have continued to conduct screening of workers every two to three weeks.\n\n\u201cScreening still has to continue to control any potential spread of cases within the factories because we know, even those vaccinated still have a risk of contracting Covid-19,\u201d he said.\n\nFMM Penang branch offers a Penang SAFE programme for factories to conduct screening tests for its workers at a lower rate of RM60 per person.\n\nOng said the programme recommends that any company taking up the package conduct screening of 100 per cent of its staff in the first round.\n\n\u201cAfter that, they can conduct screening on 20 per cent of their staff for the second round and another 20 per cent on the third round, and so on,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, one of the SMEs in Penang, Chemdyes Sdn Bhd, has checked labour laws on ways to compel its employees to get vaccinated.\n\nThe company\u2019s managing director Joe Sidek said it was informed that there are at present no laws for the company to compel its employees to register for vaccination.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t legally force them to register for vaccination, it is a personal right, so what we do is to encourage them to do it as a way to safeguard everyone\u2019s safety in the workplace,\u201d he said.\n\nThe factory, specialising in textile chemicals, has about 22 workers and Joe said all have registered for vaccination.\n\nA nurse administers a dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at the Pikas vaccination centre at the Bukit Jawi Golf Resort in Penang June 17, 2021. \u2014 Picture by Sayuti Zainudin\n\nHe said despite the downturn in the textile industry due to the pandemic, Chemdyes recorded stable revenue last year and expects an increase in revenue this year.\n\n\u201cWe have kept all our staff and did not cut any pay so we have been very fortunate and we want to ensure that everyone is safe, we do not want to have any cases that could disrupt production,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said he would allow his workers to stay home for a week and to undergo screening tests if they have been exposed to places with a high number of Covid-19 cases.\n\nMeanwhile, it was reported that the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) is considering making vaccination of all employees in the retail sector one of the pre-conditions for approval for companies to resume operation, during the National Recovery Plan (NRP) period.\n\nYin\u2019s Sourdough Bakery and cafe co-founder Ong Seng Keat has already made it compulsory for all of its 40 workers to sign up for vaccination.\n\n\u201cWe will check our workers\u2019 MySejahtera to make sure they have registered and if we have to pay for it, we will,\u201d he said.\n\nHis company has already paid for all of his workers in Klang Valley to be vaccinated under a retail industry vaccination programme.\n\nHe hopes such programmes will be available in Penang so he can send all his workers to be vaccinated as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cThe government really needs to speed up its vaccination programme for the economic frontliners because we deal with people every day,\u201d he said.\n\nMugshot Cafe co-founder Jesse Tan agrees with Ong that vaccination for economic frontliners should be sped up.\n\n\u201cSo far, all of our staff have registered for vaccination but they are still waiting for their appointments,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of Mugshot\u2019s staff contracted Covid-19 a few months back due to close contact with a relative but fortunately, it did not spread to the other staff in the cafe.\n\n\u201cThere are 15 of us in the cafe and all of us went for screening the moment we found out he was positive but luckily, we were all negative,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the incident further emphasises the importance of vaccination for all workers who deal with customers daily.\n\nAs for Hin Bus Depot manager Tan Shih Thoe, he is also considering only allowing fully vaccinated vendors to participate in the Hin Bus Depot weekly bazaar, when they are finally allowed to reopen.\n\n\u201cI was just thinking about this, especially for the market, whether I should only allow vendors who are fully vaccinated to participate... main consideration is their safety since the market is considered a crowded space,\u201d he said.\n\nThere used to be 70 vendors at the weekly market before the pandemic but due to standard operating procedures (SOPs), the number of vendors came down to around 55 each week.\n\nThe market has been closed for more than two months due to the movement control order (MCO) and subsequent phases of the NRP.\n\nHin Bus Depot has around 15 tenants, consisting of eateries and artisans, and Tan said he will also strongly encourage the tenants and their workers to register for vaccination.\n\n\u201cMost of them are in favour of vaccination as they see it as the only solution to things getting back to normal,\u201d he said.\n\nFurry Kids pet shop owner Dalbinder Singh also agrees that it is important for those in the retail sector to be vaccinated.\n\n\u201cWe are meeting people and customers daily so it is important for the safety of everyone,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, he said it would be infringing on the individual\u2019s human rights to force workers to register for vaccination so he can only encourage them to do so.\n\n\u201cFortunately, all of my staff have registered but they are still waiting... I am also still waiting for my appointment,\u201d he said.\n\nHe too said vaccination for retail workers should be sped up since they face customers daily.", "keyword": ["register", "vaccination", "manufacturing", "ong", "pikas", "workers", "services", "support", "staff", "sectors", "employers", "screening", "mandate", "covid19", "vaccinated", "penang", "vaccine"], "summary": "As there are currently no laws to enforce mandatory Covid-19 vaccination on workers, some companies are taking steps to get their workers to register for vaccination.\nPenang Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM) chairman Datuk Jimmy Ong said most factories here are encouraging their workers to register for their Covid jabs through various methods.\nHe said the vaccination of workers in MNCs is progressing very fast due to the on-site PPVs for larger factories which employ thousands of workers.\nFMM Penang branch offers a Penang SAFE programme for factories to conduct screening tests for its workers at a lower rate of RM60 per person.\nA nurse administers a dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at the Pikas vaccination centre at the Bukit Jawi Golf Resort in Penang June 17, 2021.", "news": "Malay Mail", "date": "2021-08-01 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Can employers make COVID-19 vaccinations mandatory for all staff?

Here\u2019s what you need to know:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Can employers make vaccination compulsory for employees?\n\nEmployment lawyer Donovan Cheah said there is no law now that disallows mandatory vaccination policies by employers, and that there are no known court cases in the country about whether such a policy would be legal.\n\n\u201cGiven the severity of the pandemic, having a mandatory vaccination policy is one of the ways for employers to safeguard the safety and health of their employees and curb the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cHowever, there are no reported court cases in Malaysia about the legality of mandatory vaccination policies, and whether an employer can take disciplinary action against an employee for refusing to vaccinate,\u201d he said, but noted there have been reported cases in countries like Australia and the US which upheld the dismissal of employees who refuse to comply with their employer\u2019s mandatory vaccination policy.\n\nSpecialist employment lawyer Marcus van Geyzel said employers would generally be able to make it compulsory for their employees to undergo COVID-19 vaccination if this is due to a government-imposed requirement.\n\n\u201cYes, if the MDTCA/KPDNHEP makes employee vaccinations mandatory or a pre-condition for approval to operate, the affected employers can impose this requirement on employees,\u201d he told Malay Mail.\n\n\u201cHowever, employers should be cautious where there are special circumstances, such as where an employee is unable to receive a vaccination due to a medical condition,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIn general, it would be very unlikely for an employee to successfully challenge an employer\u2019s mandatory vaccination policy where vaccinations have been declared a pre-condition for operations by the government.\n\nIn order to bring a successful legal action, an employee would have to show that in mandating vaccination, the employer has exercised its managerial power in a non-genuine manner, or that there was victimisation or an unfair labour practice,\u201d he said.\n\n2. What if the employees say no to vaccination?\n\nCheah said employers can choose to take disciplinary action against employees who refuse vaccination, and that whether such action is reasonable depends on the situation.\n\n\u201cWhile an employer cannot physically compel an employee to take the vaccine, an employee\u2019s freedom of choice is not the same thing as freedom from consequences. There are no legal prohibitions against an employer implementing a mandatory vaccination policy, although how employers deal with breaches of this policy may be evaluated by the courts,\u201d he said.\n\nCheah said disciplinary action including dismissal may be seen as reasonable, taking into account various factors.\n\nHe listed examples such as the employee\u2019s reason for refusal; whether the employee\u2019s refusal amounts to a breach of their duties or has caused loss or damage to the company or other employees; whether the employee\u2019s job function requires him/her to have regular and frequent physical interaction with third parties.\n\nOther factors listed by Cheah are the current severity of the pandemic; whether the employer\u2019s business deals with high-risk individuals; and whether vaccination is a pre-condition from the authorities for the employer to operate.\n\n\u201cWhere an employee has a legitimate reason to refuse vaccination (eg: health condition), employers should explore other ways to address the risk, such as requiring them to carry out their duties remotely and not allowing them to enter the premises without notice,\u201d Cheah added.\n\nVan Geyzel said employers would have several options, when vaccinations are a precondition for operations but there are employees who refuse to get vaccinated.\n\nThese options are to engage with the employees, or to transfer employees to alternative roles, or to ultimately stop employing the employee.\n\n\u201cThe first step should always be for employers to have clear and open conversations with these employees to ensure that they understand the reason for the vaccination requirement.\n\n\u201cEmployers can also consider redesignating or redeploying the affected employees to other roles within the business which are not customer-facing and which may be exempted from the regulatory requirements,\u201d he said.\n\nIf redesignation and redeployment is not an option, employers would be legally able to terminate the employee\u2019s employment if it is reasonable in the circumstances, he said.\n\nVan Geyzel said there is a general legal expectation that an employee has to follow all lawful and reasonable instructions by the employer.\n\nHe added that it can be argued that an employee is carrying out an act of insubordination by refusing to be vaccinated under the circumstances, as the employee is wilfully disobeying a lawful and reasonable order issued by the employer.\n\n\u201cAny punishment or action by the employer in response to insubordination has to be reasonable or proportionate, and it can be said here that where the result of the employee\u2019s vaccination is that the business would not be allowed to operate, there are serious repercussions and therefore termination of employment is a reasonable response by the employer.\n\n\u201cAnother potential justification for termination of employment is that an unvaccinated employee would be unable to perform the job or service for which the employee was employed. This would be the case if an unvaccinated employee is not permitted by law to work.\n\n\u201cIn such a situation, it may be reasonable for an employer to deem that the employment contract cannot be performed and therefore can be terminated,\u201d he said.\n\n3. What if an employee says no to vaccination due to health conditions?\n\nAs for employees who are unable to receive COVID-19 vaccinations due to a medical condition, van Geyzel said employers could explore measures such as redesignation.\n\n\u201cFirstly, I don\u2019t think the government would make vaccinations mandatory for such employees.\n\n\u201cSecondly, even if the government issued a blanket requirement, the employer should see if it\u2019s possible to apply for an exemption for that employee, or again see if redeployment or redesignation is an option.\n\n\u201cTermination should always be a last resort, but if the employer has acted reasonably, then termination should be possible under the law,\u201d he said, also saying that an employee would be unlikely to succeed in an unfair dismissal claim if an employer treated the employee fairly and could show that the termination was reasonable in the circumstances.\n\nFor employees with pre-existing health conditions that prevent them from being vaccinated, employment lawyer Jayasingam Poopalasingam said employers can seek to take mitigation measures such as changing their work roles or have them work remotely.\n\nHowever, if the nature of the business and nature of the employee\u2019s work requires vaccination, but vaccination is not possible due to the health condition and mitigating measures are not feasible through no fault of both the employer or the employee, the employer may be left with no choice but to terminate employment.\n\nThe employee could under such circumstances file a complaint to claim that the dismissal was without just cause and excuse, but it would ultimately be for the Industrial Court to decide if the dismissal was with just cause and excuse, he said.\n\n4. Putting it into the employment contract and putting it in writing\n\nJayasingam, who is also co-chair of the Bar Council\u2019s Industrial and Employment Law Committee, similarly said there are currently no laws that mandate COVID-19 vaccination for employees.\n\nThis means that for existing employees, an employer cannot \u201cforce\u201d them to be vaccinated, but can only seek to persuade and convince the employee of the need to be vaccinated due to reasons such as the nature of the work.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing much you can do, you cannot force the employee to go for vaccination, you cannot force an employee to undergo a medical procedure, it has to be by way of consent,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf they are existing employees, it must be by way of consent. They have a right to refuse vaccination, that\u2019s why we advise employers to obtain the written consent of employees to be vaccinated,\u201d he said, explaining that a mere verbal consent is not advisable as an employee could later claim to have never given consent.\n\nFor employees who pose a high risk due to the nature of their job as a frontliner or being in contact with others but refuse vaccination, employers can transfer them to another position where they do not deal with customers or other employees, he said.\n\nBut for new employees, an employer can make being vaccinated against COVID-19 a part of the employment contract prior to them joining the company, he said.\n\n\u201cYou cannot force it but what you can do is if you are having new employees, you can put it as a term of the contract, where they must be vaccinated before they are hired for employment, or they must undertake they will be vaccinated after they join you,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the new recruit would have the option of not joining the company upon viewing the contract, while employers can terminate employment if the new hire subsequently does not comply with instructions to be vaccinated as promised under the contract.\n\n5. About legal action\n\nIf an employer forces an employee to undergo COVID-19 vaccination, the employee can possibly walk out of the job and try to claim \u201cconstructive dismissal\u201d, Jayasingam said.\n\nIn cases of constructive dismissal claims, the employer does not have to issue a letter of termination, but the employee is essentially claiming that the employer has done something in breach of his contractual rights and that the employer\u2019s conduct had resulted in the employee\u2019s resignation.\n\nSuch an employee could then seek to prove their case in the Industrial Court to claim for monetary compensation and reinstatement to the job with all previous benefits and rights unaffected, including the right to not be forced to be vaccinated, Jayasingam said. It would ultimately be for the Industrial Court to decide if there was constructive dismissal.\n\nAlternatively, employees can also file a claim in civil courts but this is usually not preferred as the compensation is very small, with most employees likely to go to the Industrial Court instead, he said.\n\nUnlike new employees who have agreed to being vaccinated under the employment contract and can be terminated for non-compliance, Jayasingam said employers could face labour complaints by existing employees if the latter are terminated over their non-vaccinated status.\n\n\u201cIf the employer terminates them for not being vaccinated, the employee can file a complaint of dismissal without just cause and excuse,\u201d he said, explaining the process as involving employees filing complaints with the Industrial Relations Department under the Human Resources Ministry within 60 days of dismissal to see whether it could be resolved amicably, with the matter to be referred by the department director-general to the Industrial Court if it cannot be resolved.\n\nBut in situations where it is a government requirement for staff to be vaccinated in order to operate, an employer may have reason to terminate an employee who refuses to get vaccinated if it affects the business, Jayasingam said.\n\n\u201cSo the employer may have just cause and excuse to terminate the employee because he cannot carry on business,\u201d he said.\n\nJayasingam gave a hypothetical example, where an employee who works as a carer at a nursing home refuses to be vaccinated when it is a government requirement for such work, and the carer may as a result pose a risk to the elderly persons at the nursing home.\n\nIn such a situation and where there are no mitigation measures possible, the employer \u2014 who is unable to force the employee to be vaccinated \u2014 may opt to terminate the employee as it affects the business or may result in the nursing home having to be closed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s for the Industrial Court to decide whether what the employer did was reasonable or not,\u201d he said.\n\n6. Can the government make COVID-19 vaccination mandatory for employees?\n\nVan Geyzel said there may be a stronger basis for a compulsory vaccination requirement by the government for certain industries.\n\n\u201cThe laws that have been passed in response to the pandemic grant the government very broad powers to impose SOPs or pre-conditions for businesses to operate, and when it comes to roles or industries that have clear and frequent face-to-face contact and interaction with the general public, there is a stronger justification for the authorities to impose mandatory vaccination requirements. This is especially so as vaccinations are widely available and accessible.\n\n\u201cHowever, if the government overreaches and tries to impose mandatory vaccinations on other roles or industries where there is no clear face-to-face interaction or risk, I could see this being open to legal challenge,\u201d he said.\n\nJayasingam said the government could impose mandatory vaccinations on the general population including employees by passing an Act in Parliament, but believes that implementing such a policy of forcing vaccinations would only be a \u201clast resort.\u201d \u2014 Malay Mail", "keyword": ["vaccination", "employee", "employer", "say", "staff", "heres", "employers", "lawyers", "employees", "employment", "mandatory", "covid19", "vaccinated", "reasonable", "vaccinations"], "summary": "\u201cYes, if the MDTCA/KPDNHEP makes employee vaccinations mandatory or a pre-condition for approval to operate, the affected employers can impose this requirement on employees,\u201d he told Malay Mail.\n\u201cIn general, it would be very unlikely for an employee to successfully challenge an employer\u2019s mandatory vaccination policy where vaccinations have been declared a pre-condition for operations by the government.\n\u201cFirstly, I don\u2019t think the government would make vaccinations mandatory for such employees.\nCan the government make COVID-19 vaccination mandatory for employees?\n\u201cHowever, if the government overreaches and tries to impose mandatory vaccinations on other roles or industries where there is no clear face-to-face interaction or risk, I could see this being open to legal challenge,\u201d he said.", "news": "SoyaCincau.com", "date": "2021-08-02 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Ministry mulls proposal to control price of Covid-19 test kit", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbGF5bWFpbC5jb20vbmV3cy9tYWxheXNpYS8yMDIxLzA4LzAzL21pbmlzdHJ5LW11bGxzLXByb3Bvc2FsLXRvLWNvbnRyb2wtcHJpY2Utb2YtY292aWQtMTktdGVzdC1raXQvMTk5NDkwMtIBfGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbGF5bWFpbC5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wOC8wMy9taW5pc3RyeS1tdWxscy1wcm9wb3NhbC10by1jb250cm9sLXByaWNlLW9mLWNvdmlkLTE5LXRlc3Qta2l0LzE5OTQ5MDI?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://media2.malaymail.com/resize_cache/uploads/articles/2021/2021-07/covid_test_kit2_26072021-seo.jpg", "text": "Deputy Minister Datuk Rosol Wahid said based on feedback from the public, the test kit price is a burden especially to the low-income groups and families with many children. \u2014 Bernama pic\n\nFollow us on Instagram and subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates.\n\nKUALA BERANG, Aug 3 \u2015 The Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) is considering a proposal to control the price of the Covid-19 test kit, said Deputy Minister Datuk Rosol Wahid.\n\nHe said based on feedback from the public, the test kit price is a burden especially to the low-income groups and families with many children.\n\n\u201cWe were told that the price is RM39.90 each, not many can afford to buy it at that price.

Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on household income and made more people poorer, according to a study conducted by the Department of Statistics.\n\nThe Covid-19 impact study on household income in Malaysia for 2020 revealed that the number of poor households increased to 639,800 in 2020, up from 405,400 in 2019.\n\nThe findings of the study are contained in the Household Income Estimates and Incidence of Poverty Report, Malaysia, 2020 which the department released today.\n\nChief Statistician Datuk Seri Dr Mohd Uzir Mahidin said in a statement that the incidence of absolute poverty also increased, from 5.6 per cent in 2019 to 8.4 per cent in 2020, and that the incidence of hardcore poverty is estimated to increase from 0.4 per cent (2019) involving 27,200 households to 1.0 per cent involving 78,000 households.\n\nHe said the pandemic had also affected the structure of household groups, with 20 per cent of households from the M40 group with income between RM4,850 and RM10,959 having moved to the B40 group.\n\n\u201cHouseholds in the T20 group were also affected by the Covid-19 pandemic where 12.8 per cent of this group has shifted to the M40 group,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also said that as the percentage decrease in income for B40 and M40 households was larger than the T20 households group, the income distribution for B40 and M40 declined to 15.9 per cent (2019: 16.0 per cent) and 36.9 per cent (2019: 37.2 per cent), respectively.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the T20 group owned 47.2 per cent of income increased by 0.4 percentage points from 2019,\u201d he added.\n\nMohd Uzir said the mean of monthly household gross income decreased by negative 10.3 per cent to record RM7,089 as compared to RM7,901 in 2019 and added that the decline was contributed by households or individuals who experienced loss or reduction of income, particularly those with the status of employee, self-employed and others.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, this reduction of

earnings in the second half of the financial year 2021 (2H21), underpinned by higher exports volume and refining margins.\n\nCGS-CIMB Securities Sdn Bhd analysts Nagulan Ravi and Ivy Ng Lee Fang, in a research report, stated that MSM have rightly hedged 99% of its financial year 2021 forecast (FY21F) domestic wholesale raw sugar requirement at US$0.13 (RM0.55) to US$0.14 per pounds (lbs) and 43% of its FY22F requirement at US$0.15-0.16/lbs.\n\nLast year\u2019s raw sugar price averaged at US$0.13-0.14/lbs.\n\n\u201cThis bodes well for MSM given raw sugar prices have been trending higher over the past 18 months to US$0.185/lbs currently, due to supply disruptions in Brazil and Thailand,\u201d the analysts stated in the report yesterday, following a recent update from the company\u2019s management.\n\nThe analysts stated that MSM expects a 10% year-on-year (YoY) growth in its domestic sales volumes in FY21F and has raised its average selling prices (ASPs) for both the wholesale (up to the maximum ceiling price of RM2.69 per kg) and industry segments.\n\nThe higher ASPs and sales volumes would help boost MSM\u2019s domestic refining margins in 2H21F, they added.\n\nRavi and Ng further stated that MSM had secured export contracts worth 65% to 70% of its original 300,000MT export sales target for FY21F.\n\n\u201cThe group is now optimistic of delivering close to 350,000MT of export sales in FY21F, in line with our forecast of 340,000MT, which is a 25% YoY growth versus FY20,\u201d Ravi and Ng added.\n\nThey said the higher export volumes would be driven by stronger demand from its largest export destination, Vietnam, which accounts for around 50% of its exports, and other countries that have reopened from Covid-19 restrictions.\n\nIncreased demand for its value-added products such as liquid sugar, fine syrup and premix products could increase volumes.\n\nThe analysts viewed exports growth would lower refining costs at the group\u2019s refinery in Johor.\n\n\u201cPost the optimisation of its Johor refinery, MSM expects to achieve a 50% utilisation factor (UF) for its Johor refinery in 2H21.\n\n\u201cWe project the Johor refinery could return to the black in FY22F as we project a 52% UF for the year, driven by higher exports volumes,\u201d Ravi and Ng added.\n\nCGS-CIMB forecast MSM to deliver Ebitda margins of 10.9% to 12.4% in FY21-23F, led by higher domestic and export margins and more robust export volumes.\n\n\u201cWe raise our FY21-23F earnings per share forecast by 1.5% to 6.9% to reflect lower refining costs and higher export premiums.\n\n\u201cIn light of this, we raise our target price (TP) to RM1.69 based on a price/net tangible asset (P/ NTA) of 1.2 times (one standard deviation below MSM\u2019s 10-year average P/NTA) versus one time previously,\u201d the analysts wrote.\n\nThe brokerage firm also upgraded MSM to \u2018Add\u2019 as the stock offers a 25% upside to its TP and attractive dividend yields of 6.1% to 7.5% in FY21-23F.\n\nFurther key catalysts include potential equity placements to collaborative partners and the completion of the sale of MSM Perlis, which will allow the MSM group to book a one-off gain from the disposal of the land of RM91.6 million at 13 sen per share.\n\nThe analysts attributed key risks to lower export margins and rising raw sugar prices.\n\nMSM is currently working on doubling its liquid sugar facility\u2019s capacity and enhancing its fine syrup facility due to the rising demand for these products.\n\nIn the longer term, the \u201cGula Prai\u201d producer plans to expand its export segment further by increasing its regional presence in the Asia-Pacific region and establishing a local presence in countries such as China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Singapore, Indonesia and South Korea.\n\nAs of 2019, MSM corroborated up to 60% of the domestic market share and ranked the eighth largest sugar refiner globally by capacity.\n\nMSM share price declined 2.22% to

integrated nature of the Asean\u2019s supply chain, the impact from Vietnam\u2019s Covid-19 woes which culminated in the extension of lockdown measures under the government\u2019s Directive 16 in various provinces in the south are felt by Malaysian businesses that have a presence there.\n\nThe directive stipulates the closure of non-essential businesses, ban on public gatherings and severely limited transport services, in an attempt to contain the wave of Covid Delta variant infections.\n\nIn the past, Vietnam enjoyed success in containing the pandemic attributed to prompt border closure and lockdown measures, as well as an extensive testing and contact tracing strategy.\n\nVietnam recorded 8,324 new Covid-19 cases on Friday, according to the country\u2019s Ministry of Health. The new infections brought the total tally to 193,381, with 3,016 deaths, the ministry said.\n\nCurrently, 19 southern localities in the country, including Ho Chi Minh City, have implemented a lockdown via Directive 16 until Aug 16. Meanwhile, The lockdown in Hanoi, Vietnam\u2019s capital, has been extended by 15 days until Aug 22.\n\nAs a result, a number of Bursa Malaysia-listed issuers with facilities in Vietnam have reported suspension of operations there.\n\nYBS International Bhd\n\nIts subsidiary, Oriental Fastech Manufacturing (Vietnam), which is involved in high precision metal fabrication and assembly, is partially suspending its operations to comply with the government\u2019s directive.\n\nMagni-Tech Industries Bhd\n\nIts garment production facilities in Vietnam have been suspended in line with the government\u2019s directive. The group is mitigating the impact of the closure via close engagement with its customers to manage the production capacity challenges as well as rescheduling delivery dates to meet customer\u2019s demand. It is assessing the impact of the closure on its financial performance and announcements will be made if there is any material development.\n\nPoh Huat Resources Holdings Bhd\n\nThe group\u2019s subsidiary, Poh Huat Furniture Industries Vietnam Joint Stock Co, which has factories in Binh Duong Province and Dong Nai Province, has halted production activities in line with the lockdown order. As of July 21, it said none of its employees in the two locations has exhibited any Covid-19 symptoms and it will undertake screening and quarantine measures should any employee exhibit symptoms or be confirmed positive of the virus.\n\nConsequently, the production interruption is expected to cause delay in the shipment of orders to its customers in the US. Poh Huat\u2019s management is in discussions with affected customers to reschedule their delivery dates for affected orders. It said it is able to mitigate some of the impact from the closure as it has a certain amount of ready inventory to meet the orders and it will increase production with extended shifts upon resumption of production activities, if necessary.\n\nLatitude Tree Holdings Bhd\n\nTwo of the group\u2019s subsidiaries, Latitude Tree Vietnam Joint Stock Co and RK Resources Co Ltd, are partially suspending operations to comply with Vietnam\u2019s Directive 16.

These criteria must be publicised so that any future decisions will be solely based on evidence,\u201d MHC explained.\n\nAdditionally, the coalition said the government should clarify the specifics of these relaxed restrictions, because blanket vaccine privileges will create loopholes that will impede NRP.\n\n\u201cFor example, the government must answer questions like: What is the rationale to allow home quarantine for vaccinated travellers, how long is the quarantine and how will we monitor? How do we close the loopholes that may allow \u2018inter-state vacations on the pretext of visiting our children?\u2019\u201d it said.\n\nMeanwhile, Malaysian Medical Association (MMA) president Datuk Dr Subramaniam Muniandy said the decision to relax restrictions must be supported with sufficient scientific evidence.\n\n\u201cIf it is indeed a decision based on science, why then is travel allowed for those wishing to see their spouse or their young children? Either it\u2019s sufficiently safe for the fully vaccinated to travel, in which case all vaccinated individuals should be allowed to do so, or it is not, in which nobody should travel,\u201d he said.\n\nHe noted that some of those states in Phase 2 are showing an increasing trend in Covid-19 cases.\n\n\u201cThe government should stop its hyping up on the total number of cases. What is important are hospital bed utilisation and the intensive care units (ICUs) situation in the country,\u201d Dr Subramaniam said.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, we hope that the government will provide an update on the positivity rate and the status of bed utilisation and ICUs in each state as these will be more meaningful indicators apart from the daily new cases. It is important that the public be kept informed of the bed capacity and ICUs status in their respective state,\u201d he added.\n\nMMA also said that the lifting of restrictions must also take into account high-risk groups such as nursing homes, factory and construction workers, security guards, cleaners, medical students and undocumented migrant workers that have not been vaccinated.",

ingredient.\n\nCaffeine, an active ingredient that shouldn\u2019t be ignored\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon to find cosmetics formulated with caffeine, an active ingredient known for its slimming and firming benefits.\n\nGenerally, it is found in creams, gels, and other beauty products designed to help lose a few centimetres on the hips, thighs, or buttocks, as well as in anti-cellulite products or formulations designed to help users improve toning or firmness.\n\nBut caffeine is also present in certain facial care products, again with the aim of fighting skin slackening, but also \u2013 and above all \u2013 to improve the appearance of the eye contour area and reduce puffiness and dark circles (it can be even more effective if the product has spent some time in the refrigerator).\n\nCreams, gels, masks, cleansers: caffeine is nowadays found in products at all price points in the cosmetic departments of department stores and specialised shops.\n\nIn the form of powder and grounds\n\nWith the advent of DIY beauty, coffee now shows up in many so-called \u201chomemade\u201d recipes in the form of powder or grounds.\n\nRich in caffeine, these formulations can offer the advantages mentioned above, but are also powerful antioxidants, which allows them to fight against certain effects seen on mature skins, and more generally against skin aging.\n\nIn addition to these inherent virtues, coffee grounds, thanks to their specific texture, also make for a great exfoliant for sloughing off dead cells.\n\nAll you need to do is mix it with other ingredients: egg white for a mask, vegetable oil and honey for a face and body scrub, or even on its own to exfoliate scalp and hair to make it shinier.\n\nOver on TikTok, known for being the go-to social network for DIY beauty recipes, one can also discover a multitude of recipes for masks and scrubs made from soluble coffee or coffee beans.\n\nRecipes that users seem to have not only tested but also

Digital\u2019s Fuel Insight and FlightPulse aviation software to transform and modernise the airline\u2019s fuel efficiency programme.\n\nMAB has implemented various initiatives including efficiency measures, investments in sustainability solutions and waste reduction across its operations to address its sustainability goals.\n\nThe fuel efficiency programme has been running for over a decade, contributing to a 15% fuel burn improvement recorded over the past eight years.\n\nMAB\u2019s group operations officer, Ahmad Luqman Mohd Azmi, stated promoting sustainability in all of the MAB\u2019s operations has always been a top priority.\n\nHe said digitalisation is a core component of the airlines\u2019 long term business plan and such efforts bring immediate value especially in the area of fuel efficiency.\n\n\u201cWe are looking forward to such a partnership that contributes to the airline\u2019s efforts to accelerate our sustainability target.\n\n\u201cThrough these solutions, we seek to play a greater part in building a legacy for future generations and enhancing our own airline\u2019s sustainability efforts,\u201d Ahmad Luqman said in a statement yesterday.\n\nFuel Insight is a cost and emissions monitoring solution that works by understanding data from the aircraft to uncover valuable intelligence that helps increase fuel efficiency and reduce waste.\n\nIt also gives operators actionable intelligence at multiple levels allowing analysts to drill down macro trends to understand issues on a per-flight level.\n\nThe software uses GE Digital\u2019s Event Measurement System (EMS) aviation data and analytics platform to merge flight data with flight plans, load sheets and fuel uplift data, identify the most attainable fuel savings opportunities, and track the incremental savings across the operation.\n\nFlightPulse, meanwhile, puts data directly into the hands of pilots, allowing them to visualise their savings over time.\n\nPilots who understand their own performance can adjust their flight plans to maximise safety and fuel efficiency.\n\nSecure benchmarking and data sharing allows crew members to see their contribution to projects and dramatically shortens the feedback loop.\n\nMAB evaluated the software with an extensive team of pilots, dispatchers and analysts who endorsed the software solution, which is hosted on GE Digital\u2019s EMS platform.\n\nEMS is built on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform providing compute, data, and security services.\n\nGE Digital\u2019s GM of the aviation software business Andrew Coleman said the

operations.\n\n\u201cThese solutions will help MAB to leverage software to improve efficiency and reduce carbon emissions,\u201d Coleman added.\n\nThe solution will be implemented by the GE Digital

But fans in Malaysia have something to look forward to as two locals are working on a real-life version of the game \u2013 and this time, you can finally taste your veggies.\n\nWith the help of artificial intelligence and, in the near future, drones, Aquaville Asia hopes to become the world\u2019s first aquaponics farm where subscribers can nurture actual crops through their phones.\n\nFeeling like kale this week but kangkung the next? No problem, just tap on your screen and come harvest day, you will be greeted at your doorstep with fresh greens harvested from your own aquaponic plot.\n\nThat\u2019s the plan, at least \u2013 but for the time being, the concept is already in motion where subscribers can get five packs of vegetables delivered four times a month, with optional tilapia fish.\n\nAquaville founder Chia Weng Yan tells FMT that the idea came to him in the middle of the night. \u201cI dreamt about it and jotted down \u2018FarmVille in real life\u2019,\u201d the 40-year-old says.\n\n\u201cI created a pitch deck for it thinking it was a great idea, but didn\u2019t execute it and kept it on my computer for a long time,\u201d he adds, explaining that he struggled to find someone with the technological know-how to make his literal dream a reality.\n\nThen, in July last year, Chia found the perfect person for the job.\n\nLoke Chung Eng had posted on Facebook about robotics and projects involving IOT, or \u201cinternet of things\u201d, a network of physical objects embedded with sensors, software and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data.\n\nA phone call later and Chia had joined forces with Loke, 33, to create Aquaville Asia. The duo worked for months on the concept.\n\nWhile Loke spent time programming the AI system, Chia reached out to urban farmers, friends and family members to get them on board.\n\nThe duo forged an alliance with AHA Services Malaysia, a farm run by urban agriculturalists who provide Aquaville with all their farming requirements, including maintenance, harvest and delivery of fresh produce to subscribers.\n\nChia and Loke leave the farming to these experts and do their share by equipping the farm with Aquaville\u2019s AI technology.\n\n\u201cWe provide them with smart-farm capabilities so if any subscriptions come in, they are ready to harvest and deliver the produce,\u201d Chia explains.\n\nHe adds that using AI, Loke created a way to spot diseases in crops using an NDVI camera that scans vegetables at different wavelengths \u201cso you know if they are dying ahead of time\u201d.\n\nThe AI system can even monitor pH levels, humidity, heat and water levels. All their crops are pesticide-free.\n\nAquaville was officially launched in January this year, and subscribers have been effusive about how lush and crisp their vegetables are, compared with those bought in a store.\n\nSome customers have also funnelled their harvests to the needy, among them three companies that donated to a special-needs home in Petaling Jaya \u2013 sending bundles of fresh greens to feed 74 children between January and June \u2013 as well as contributed towards the white flag movement.\n\nIn the near future, Chia and Loke aim to introduce an application and drone system that will swoop over crops and capture real-time footage. Subscribers will be able to monitor their greens and control them through the app.\n\nAdditionally, the duo hope to empower the less fortunate and provide deaf, mute and B40 families with job opportunities on the farm.\n\nIt may take a few years for this FarmVille dream to fully become a reality, but the Aquaville innovators are hopeful and looking forward to a bright and greener future.\n\nFor fresh produce at your door each week or to help the needy, contact Aquaville Asia via Facebook or check out their website.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["taste", "malaysias", "veggies", "provide", "ai", "loke", "crops", "system", "chia", "aquaville", "farmville", "subscribers", "fresh", "vegetables"], "summary": "PETALING JAYA: Thousands were left cropless and devastated last year when Zynga\u2019s popular game FarmVille announced the end of its 11-year legacy.\nBut fans in Malaysia have something to look forward to as two locals are working on a real-life version of the game \u2013 and this time, you can finally taste your veggies.\nAquaville founder Chia Weng Yan tells FMT that the idea came to him in the middle of the night.\nWhile Loke spent time programming the AI system, Chia reached out to urban farmers, friends and family members to get them on board.\nThe AI system can even monitor pH levels, humidity, heat and water levels.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-08-12 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "1989 Proton Black Knight Wins \u201cUnexceptional\u201d Award In UK Car Festival", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL2Z1bi8yMDIxLzA4LzAzLzE5ODktcHJvdG9uLWJsYWNrLWtuaWdodC13aW5zLXVuZXhjZXB0aW9uYWwtYXdhcmQtaW4tdWstY2FyLWZlc3RpdmFsL9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL2Z1bi8yMDIxLzA4LzAzLzE5ODktcHJvdG9uLWJsYWNrLWtuaWdodC13aW5zLXVuZXhjZXB0aW9uYWwtYXdhcmQtaW4tdWstY2FyLWZlc3RpdmFsL2FtcC8?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Azizul Rahman Ismail", "Maya Suraya"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Proton-Black-Knight.jpeg", "text": "Subscribe to our new Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates.\n\nThe Proton Saga is Malaysia\u2019s first car and was the symbol of the nation\u2019s success.

The colour of its bright and deep red seeds was the inspiration for the signature hue of the national car.\n\nHowever, the reality is, the name \u201cSaga\u201d was the winning entry in a competition held in 1984.\n\nThe winner, Staf Sarjan Ismail Jaafar said that the name is actually an acronym for Safety, Achievement, Greatness, and Ability.\n\nThey Don\u2019t Make Them Like They Used To\n\nThe first generation Saga had many iterations and was in production up to 1992.\n\nOne of its most notable versions of the Saga was a hatchback released in 1987 during the peak of popularity of a certain TV show starring a certain modified Pontiac Trans Am.\n\nThe hatchback was called the Proton Knight. It was later named Proton Saga Aeroback, perhaps for copyright reasons. But to be fair, the new name is more descriptive.\n\nAt the same time, the Proton Saga was also sold all over the world including the UK.\n\nIn fact, the UK even got versions of the Proton Saga that are not available in Malaysia.

gathering of Pacific dignitaries in Auckland.\nMinister for Pacific Peoples William Sio, who emigrated with his family from Samoa to New Zealand in 1969, described the raids as \u201cracism of the worst kind\u201d.\nWhen Ardern first announced she would issue an apology, Sio fought back tears as he recalled the terrifying experience of being targeted.\nIt was quite traumatising.\u201dArdern said New Zealand was committed to eliminating racism and she hoped the apology \u201chas brought some much-needed closure and healing for our Pacific communities\u201d.", "news": "Free Malaysia

26th out of 30 divers at the Tokyo Aquatics Centre here.\n\nPandelela accumulated 284.90 points from five dives while Jun Hoong managed 251.80 points.\n\nThe 28-year-old Pandelela, who won gold at the 2021 Diving World Cup at the same venue in May, enjoyed a good start with 72.0 points to be ranked fourth.\n\nHowever, her performance took a dive in the next three rounds as her scores went down to 60.90 in the second round, 52.80 in the third and a paltry 28.80 in the fourth.\n\nLuckily for her, she got back into her groove to score 70.40 points in her fifth and final dive to finish among the top 18 divers.\n\nAs for 2017 world champion Jun Hoong, she paid the price for two poor opening dives, with the 31-year-old recording scores of 36.00 and 34.80 respectively, thus ending her medal hopes at her third Olympics since the 2012 London edition.\n\nAlthough she bounced back with scores of 57.60 (third dive), 65.80 (fourth dive) and 57.60 (fifth dive), it was too little too late for her as she missed out on the top 18 spot.\n\nAs expected, China\u2019s Chen Yuxi (390.70 points) and Quan Hongchan (364.45) dominated to claim the top two spots while American Delaney Schnell (360.75) finished third.\n\nThe top 18 divers will compete in the semifinals at 9am tomorrow, where the top 12 will then qualify for the final on the same day at 2pm.\n\nIn the women\u2019s 10m platform

year\u2019s Merdeka will be like no other, courtesy of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nWith most of the Klang Valley and other urban centres under strict lockdown, the usual display of patriotic sentiments will be somewhat drowned out by the pervasive gloom of the moment.\n\nYet, 27 artists have chosen to express their love for the country during the month of Merdeka by displaying their works in an online exhibition titled very simply \u201cJalur Gemilang\u201d.\n\nOpen for viewing until the end of the month, the exhibition is hosted by Artas Galeri, an art gallery based in Petaling Jaya.\n\nAccording to Roy Ng, Artas Galeri\u2019s director, plans were already underway to hold a physical Merdeka-themed exhibition in the months leading up to August.\n\nHowever, with the extension of MCO 3.0, it became painfully clear that Plan B would have to be executed.\n\n\u201cDue to the pandemic and the increasing number of cases, I decided to launch an online show with an e-catalogue instead,\u201d he said.\n\nThat way, art enthusiasts will still be able to view the art pieces themselves without leaving the safety of their homes.\n\n\u201cMost of these artists\u2019 works exhibited in the \u2018Jalur Gemilang\u2019 exhibition are based on our national flag\u2019s colours,\u201d Ng said, adding that a majority of them used copious amounts of red, yellow, blue and white in multiple art styles including abstract, still-life and figurative.\n\nAccording to him, the artists are a fascinating group made up of graduates fresh out of art school as well as senior artists who have made a name for themselves in the art world.\n\nFMT had the pleasure of interviewing six of the artists regarding their hopes for the country this Merdeka month.\n\nYuki Lim Xiao Mun, artist of the almost ethereal \u201cThe Paradise Land\u201d, had this to say: \u201cMy hope for this Merdeka month is that our country can be restored to good condition after the economic hardship caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nShe said it was also her sincere hope that Malaysia\u2019s leaders will lead the country down the right path by practising integrity in their leadership.\n\nLikewise, Fadzril Fakaruddin encouraged Malaysians to stay united no matter what the circumstances, so that together, they could be free of Covid-19 for good.\n\nWhile Hamir Soib hopes for better governance, fellow artist Najib Ahmad Bamadhaj is hopeful for a return to normalcy and the good \u2018ol pre-Covid days.\n\nNational unity is something that veteran artist, Awang Damit, believes is vital if the country is to survive these difficult times.\n\nAnd another artist, Zulkefli Talha, reminded Malaysians to love each other as fellow countrymen regardless of racial or religious differences.\n\n\u201cLeaders have to be good examples for the people. And both leaders and the people have to work together to end this pandemic and return Malaysia to its former glory.\u201d\n\nNg told FMT that the pandemic had been especially tough on many artists. The numerous lockdowns this past year and a half meant potential buyers were unable to view the artworks personally and as a consequence, there was little to no sales.\n\nHe said there was an urgent need for artists to find alternative avenues to display their work so that they could continue to earn a decent living.\n\nNg explained that things have not been looking up for artists for a while now. Prior to the pandemic, the sluggish economy meant artists struggled to make a sale. The lockdowns brought about by the pandemic, only made things worse.\n\n\u201cMost collectors and buyers prefer to see the pieces in person. There\u2019s a huge difference between seeing artworks personally and virtually,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen you view an artwork physically, you will be able to see the texture, notice the colour tones and spot the little details. That\u2019s something these virtual exhibitions sadly cannot offer.\u201d\n\nHowever, this has not dampened the spirit of art collectors such as Brendan Siva in regard to the \u201cJalur Gemilang\u201d exhibition.\n\n\u201cEach piece is unique as an individual interpretation and expression of what Malaysia represents and symbolises in the eyes of the artist. It reflects the rich cultural and social fabric of Malaysia and its people.\u201d\n\nAnother art collector, Bingley Sim added, \u201cThe different styles and approaches in the use of the red, blue, yellow and white colours in the artworks reflect the exuberant spirit of Malaysia.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe works in the \u2018Jalur Gemilang\u2019 exhibition this year are all about resilience, tenacity and hope,\u201d said fellow art collector Cheow Wee.\n\n\u201cArt is a topic that brings people together no matter what ethnicity or religious belief one belongs to.\u201d\n\nHe added that since artists too are experiencing a bad year, it is important for other Malaysians to step up and support them.\n\n\u201cWe want to urge local artists never to give up as many of us will support them in our own little ways. After all, Kita Jaga Kita.\u201d\n\nTo find out more about Artas Galeri, visit them on Instagram, Facebook or WhatsApp 010-9009363 for an e-catalogue.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["exhibition", "art", "local", "pandemic", "month", "works", "merdeka", "view", "artists", "mark", "country", "online", "artist"], "summary": "PETALING JAYA: There\u2019s no question that this year\u2019s Merdeka will be like no other, courtesy of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nYet, 27 artists have chosen to express their love for the country during the month of Merdeka by displaying their works in an online exhibition titled very simply \u201cJalur Gemilang\u201d.\nOpen for viewing until the end of the month, the exhibition is hosted by Artas Galeri, an art gallery based in Petaling Jaya.\nFMT had the pleasure of interviewing six of the artists regarding their hopes for the country this Merdeka month.\n\u201cWe want to urge local artists never to give up as many of us will support them in our own little ways.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-08-13 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "US smash world record in men\u2019s 4x100m medley relay", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9zcG9ydHMvMjAyMS8wOC8wMS91cy1zbWFzaC13b3JsZC1yZWNvcmQtaW4tbWVucy00eDEwMG0tbWVkbGV5LXJlbGF5L9IBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/us-relay-4x100-010821-ap.jpg", "text": "TOKYO: A storming butterfly leg from Caeleb Dressel powered the US to a new world record and the gold medal in the men\u2019s Olympic 4x100m medley relay final today.\n\nThe US team of Ryan Murphy, Michael Andrew, Dressel and Zach Apple touched in 3:26.78s to smash the global 3:27.28s mark set at the 2009 World Championships.\n\nBritain came second in 3:27.51s and Italy were third in 3:29.17s.\n\nThe Americans were trailing at 200m after Andrew\u2019s breaststroke leg against Britain\u2019s Adam Peaty but when Dressel hit the water that all changed.\n\nHe clawed back the lead, leaving Apple to finish the job.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["mens", "water", "4x100m", "leg", "medley", "trailing", "touched", "dressel", "record", "world", "zach", "apple", "todaythe", "smash", "relay", "tokyo"], "summary": "TOKYO: A storming butterfly leg from Caeleb Dressel powered the US to a new world record and the gold medal in the men\u2019s Olympic 4x100m medley relay final today.\nThe US team of Ryan Murphy, Michael Andrew, Dressel and Zach Apple touched in 3:26.78s to smash the global 3:27.28s mark set at the 2009 World Championships.\nBritain came second in 3:27.51s and Italy were third in 3:29.17s.\nThe Americans were trailing at 200m after Andrew\u2019s breaststroke leg against Britain\u2019s Adam Peaty but when Dressel hit the water that all changed.\nHe clawed back the lead, leaving Apple to finish the job.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-08-01 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Meet Ita O\u2019Brian: in-demand intimacy coordinator", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9sZWlzdXJlL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvMjAyMS8wNy8zMC9tZWV0LWl0YS1vYnJpYW4taW4tZGVtYW5kLWludGltYWN5LWNvb3JkaW5hdG9yL9IBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ita-lifestyle.jpg", "text": "LONDON: Britain\u2019s Ita O\u2019Brien is one of entertainment\u2019s unsung stars, ensuring actors are comfortable filming their most sensitive scenes in a job she has made her own.\n\nThe 56-year-old intimacy coordinator has been a key figure behind sex scenes in acclaimed television series such as \u201cI May Destroy You\u201d, \u201cSex Education\u201d and \u201cNormal People\u201d.\n\nPreserving the intimacy of an artist filming a rape depiction, setting up a sex scene with a virgin actor, and identifying the limits each actor is comfortable with are all issues O\u2019Brien is regularly confronted with.\n\nA typical conversation she regularly has with stars, she says, goes along the lines of: \u201cHe is going to put his hand here, you put yours there and then you start the fellatio.\u201d\n\nShe sees her role as one of ensuring \u201copen communication\u201d between the director and the actors on all intimate scenes that may include kissing, nudity or sex.\n\n\u201cThis is a process by which we bring our professional structure to intimacy\u201d, allowing the on-screen stars to \u201cbring all of the skills of the actor to this moment,\u201d she adds.\n\n\u201cWe agree on a consent of touch and then a clear process by which we choreograph the intimate contact clearly. So it\u2019s just like dance.\u201d\n\nEach scene will be discussed and rehearsed beforehand, away from the glare of the dozens of people usually present on a set.\n\n\u201cWhen the camera rolls or they\u2019re up on stage, they know they can perform that intimate contact, knowing where they\u2019re going to be touched,\u201d she says.\n\nAt the heart of her philosophy is consent, in an industry which has been rocked in recent years by sexual assault claims. Her motto, which she says she often repeats to actors, is: \u201cYour \u2018no\u2019 is a gift. Tell us your \u2018no\u2019, so that we can trust your \u2018yes'\u201d.\n\n\u2018Incredibly hard\u2019\n\nO\u2019Brien was a dancer in the theatre for 10 years and then an actress for eight before she sensed an opportunity and became an intimacy coordinator in 2014.\n\nIt was a pioneering move at a time when actors\u2019 consent was little talked about, and before the #MeToo movement against sexual abuse and sexual harassment.\n\nBefore then, \u201cif an actor ever said \u2018no\u2019, they\u2019d be a troublemaker or a diva, and they would certainly be worried about losing their job,\u201d she recalls.\n\nIn such an environment, she describes her early days in the role as \u201cincredibly hard\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had productions where I\u2019ve been told not to speak to the director,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m serving the director\u2019s vision, but the director doesn\u2019t want to speak to me because he\u2019s a 74-year-old man, who basically doesn\u2019t want to acknowledge my existence.\u201d\n\nOn other occasions, she was not allowed on the set because the actors or director did not want her help.\n\nAttitudes have since changed a lot. The profession is becoming more popular and O\u2019Brien is in high demand, especially after Michaela Coel dedicated her best actress BAFTA win this year for \u201cI May Destroy You\u201d to her.\n\n\u201cThank you, Ita, for making a space safe, for creating physical, emotional and professional boundaries, so we can make work about exploitation, loss of respect, about abuse of powers, without being exploited or abused in the process,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["stars", "sexual", "ita", "obrien", "indemand", "intimacy", "process", "coordinator", "scenes", "sex", "actor",

Covid jabs per day and are moving towards increasing to 20,000 doses per day. \u2014 Picture by Sayuti Zainudin\n\nFollow us on Instagram and subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates.\n\nGEORGE TOWN, Aug 1 \u2014 Factories and small businesses in Penang, especially those hard hit by disruptions due to the Covid-19 pandemic, are looking forward to resuming operations as soon as possible even if it means making vaccination mandatory for their workers.\n\nAs there are currently no laws to enforce mandatory Covid-19 vaccination on workers, some companies are taking steps to get their workers to register for vaccination.\n\nPenang Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM) chairman Datuk Jimmy Ong said most factories here are encouraging their workers to register for their Covid jabs through various methods.\n\n\u201cSome companies are giving paid leave to their workers to go for vaccination and some are even offering monetary rewards,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the main reason multinational companies (MNC) are setting up Program Imunisasi Industri Covid-19 Kerjasama Awam-Swasta (Pikas) vaccination centres within their own factory grounds is to encourage their workers to get vaccinated.\n\nHe said the Pikas PPVs in Penang are now dispensing 15,000 doses per day and are moving towards increasing to 20,000 doses per day.\n\nHe said the vaccination of workers in MNCs is progressing very fast due to the on-site PPVs for larger factories which employ thousands of workers.\n\n\u201cIt is slower for small medium enterprises as they can only send their workers to the Pikas PPVs and there are only two of those now; one in Jawi and one at Equatorial Hotel,\u201d he said.\n\nEven with vaccination in full force, Ong said some of the companies in the manufacturing sector have continued to conduct screening of workers every two to three weeks.\n\n\u201cScreening still has to continue to control any potential spread of cases within the factories because we know, even those vaccinated still have a risk of contracting Covid-19,\u201d he said.\n\nFMM Penang branch offers a Penang SAFE programme for factories to conduct screening tests for its workers at a lower rate of RM60 per person.\n\nOng said the programme recommends that any company taking up the package conduct screening of 100 per cent of its staff in the first round.\n\n\u201cAfter that, they can conduct screening on 20 per cent of their staff for the second round and another 20 per cent on the third round, and so on,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, one of the SMEs in Penang, Chemdyes Sdn Bhd, has checked labour laws on ways to compel its employees to get vaccinated.\n\nThe company\u2019s managing director Joe Sidek said it was informed that there are at present no laws for the company to compel its employees to register for vaccination.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t legally force them to register for vaccination, it is a personal right, so what we do is to encourage them to do it as a way to safeguard everyone\u2019s safety in the workplace,\u201d he said.\n\nThe factory, specialising in textile chemicals, has about 22 workers and Joe said all have registered for vaccination.\n\nA nurse administers a dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at the Pikas vaccination centre at the Bukit Jawi Golf Resort in Penang June 17, 2021. \u2014 Picture by Sayuti Zainudin\n\nHe said despite the downturn in the textile industry due to the pandemic, Chemdyes recorded stable revenue last year and expects an increase in revenue this year.\n\n\u201cWe have kept all our staff and did not cut any pay so we have been very fortunate and we want to ensure that everyone is safe, we do not want to have any cases that could disrupt production,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said he would allow his workers to stay home for a week and to undergo screening tests if they have been exposed to places with a high number of Covid-19 cases.\n\nMeanwhile, it was reported that the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) is considering making vaccination of all employees in the retail sector one of the pre-conditions for approval for companies to resume operation, during the National Recovery Plan (NRP) period.\n\nYin\u2019s Sourdough Bakery and cafe co-founder Ong Seng Keat has already made it compulsory for all of its 40 workers to sign up for vaccination.\n\n\u201cWe will check our workers\u2019 MySejahtera to make sure they have registered and if we have to pay for it, we will,\u201d he said.\n\nHis company has already paid for all of his workers in Klang Valley to be vaccinated under a retail industry vaccination programme.\n\nHe hopes such programmes will be available in Penang so he can send all his workers to be vaccinated as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cThe government really needs to speed up its vaccination programme for the economic frontliners because we deal with people every day,\u201d he said.\n\nMugshot Cafe co-founder Jesse Tan agrees with Ong that vaccination for economic frontliners should be sped up.\n\n\u201cSo far, all of our staff have registered for vaccination but they are still waiting for their appointments,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of Mugshot\u2019s staff contracted Covid-19 a few months back due to close contact with a relative but fortunately, it did not spread to the other staff in the cafe.\n\n\u201cThere are 15 of us in the cafe and all of us went for screening the moment we found out he was positive but luckily, we were all negative,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the incident further emphasises the importance of vaccination for all workers who deal with customers daily.\n\nAs for Hin Bus Depot manager Tan Shih Thoe, he is also considering only allowing fully vaccinated vendors to participate in the Hin Bus Depot weekly bazaar, when they are finally allowed to reopen.\n\n\u201cI was just thinking about this, especially for the market, whether I should only allow vendors who are fully vaccinated to participate... main consideration is their safety since the market is considered a crowded space,\u201d he said.\n\nThere used to be 70 vendors at the weekly market before the pandemic but due to standard operating procedures (SOPs), the number of vendors came down to around 55 each week.\n\nThe market has been closed for more than two months due to the movement control order (MCO) and subsequent phases of the NRP.\n\nHin Bus Depot has around 15 tenants, consisting of eateries and artisans, and Tan said he will also strongly encourage the tenants and their workers to register for vaccination.\n\n\u201cMost of them are in favour of vaccination as they see it as the only solution to things getting back to normal,\u201d he said.\n\nFurry Kids pet shop owner Dalbinder Singh also agrees that it is important for those in the retail sector to be vaccinated.\n\n\u201cWe are meeting people and customers daily so it is important for the safety of everyone,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, he said it would be infringing on the individual\u2019s human rights to force workers to register for vaccination so he can only encourage them to do so.\n\n\u201cFortunately, all of my staff have registered but they are still waiting... I am also still waiting for my appointment,\u201d he said.\n\nHe too said vaccination for retail workers should be sped up since they face customers daily.", "keyword": ["register", "vaccination", "manufacturing", "ong", "pikas", "workers", "services", "support", "staff", "sectors", "employers", "screening", "mandate", "covid19", "vaccinated", "penang", "vaccine"], "summary": "As there are currently no laws to enforce mandatory Covid-19 vaccination on workers, some companies are taking steps to get their workers to register for vaccination.\nPenang Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM) chairman Datuk Jimmy Ong said most factories here are encouraging their workers to register for their Covid jabs through various methods.\nHe said the vaccination of workers in MNCs is progressing very fast due to the on-site PPVs for larger factories which employ thousands of workers.\nFMM Penang branch offers a Penang SAFE programme for factories to conduct screening tests for its workers at a lower rate of RM60 per person.\nA nurse administers a dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at the Pikas vaccination centre at the Bukit Jawi Golf Resort in Penang June 17, 2021.", "news": "Malay Mail", "date": "2021-08-01 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Can employers make COVID-19 vaccinations mandatory for all staff?

Here\u2019s what you need to know:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Can employers make vaccination compulsory for employees?\n\nEmployment lawyer Donovan Cheah said there is no law now that disallows mandatory vaccination policies by employers, and that there are no known court cases in the country about whether such a policy would be legal.\n\n\u201cGiven the severity of the pandemic, having a mandatory vaccination policy is one of the ways for employers to safeguard the safety and health of their employees and curb the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cHowever, there are no reported court cases in Malaysia about the legality of mandatory vaccination policies, and whether an employer can take disciplinary action against an employee for refusing to vaccinate,\u201d he said, but noted there have been reported cases in countries like Australia and the US which upheld the dismissal of employees who refuse to comply with their employer\u2019s mandatory vaccination policy.\n\nSpecialist employment lawyer Marcus van Geyzel said employers would generally be able to make it compulsory for their employees to undergo COVID-19 vaccination if this is due to a government-imposed requirement.\n\n\u201cYes, if the MDTCA/KPDNHEP makes employee vaccinations mandatory or a pre-condition for approval to operate, the affected employers can impose this requirement on employees,\u201d he told Malay Mail.\n\n\u201cHowever, employers should be cautious where there are special circumstances, such as where an employee is unable to receive a vaccination due to a medical condition,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIn general, it would be very unlikely for an employee to successfully challenge an employer\u2019s mandatory vaccination policy where vaccinations have been declared a pre-condition for operations by the government.\n\nIn order to bring a successful legal action, an employee would have to show that in mandating vaccination, the employer has exercised its managerial power in a non-genuine manner, or that there was victimisation or an unfair labour practice,\u201d he said.\n\n2. What if the employees say no to vaccination?\n\nCheah said employers can choose to take disciplinary action against employees who refuse vaccination, and that whether such action is reasonable depends on the situation.\n\n\u201cWhile an employer cannot physically compel an employee to take the vaccine, an employee\u2019s freedom of choice is not the same thing as freedom from consequences. There are no legal prohibitions against an employer implementing a mandatory vaccination policy, although how employers deal with breaches of this policy may be evaluated by the courts,\u201d he said.\n\nCheah said disciplinary action including dismissal may be seen as reasonable, taking into account various factors.\n\nHe listed examples such as the employee\u2019s reason for refusal; whether the employee\u2019s refusal amounts to a breach of their duties or has caused loss or damage to the company or other employees; whether the employee\u2019s job function requires him/her to have regular and frequent physical interaction with third parties.\n\nOther factors listed by Cheah are the current severity of the pandemic; whether the employer\u2019s business deals with high-risk individuals; and whether vaccination is a pre-condition from the authorities for the employer to operate.\n\n\u201cWhere an employee has a legitimate reason to refuse vaccination (eg: health condition), employers should explore other ways to address the risk, such as requiring them to carry out their duties remotely and not allowing them to enter the premises without notice,\u201d Cheah added.\n\nVan Geyzel said employers would have several options, when vaccinations are a precondition for operations but there are employees who refuse to get vaccinated.\n\nThese options are to engage with the employees, or to transfer employees to alternative roles, or to ultimately stop employing the employee.\n\n\u201cThe first step should always be for employers to have clear and open conversations with these employees to ensure that they understand the reason for the vaccination requirement.\n\n\u201cEmployers can also consider redesignating or redeploying the affected employees to other roles within the business which are not customer-facing and which may be exempted from the regulatory requirements,\u201d he said.\n\nIf redesignation and redeployment is not an option, employers would be legally able to terminate the employee\u2019s employment if it is reasonable in the circumstances, he said.\n\nVan Geyzel said there is a general legal expectation that an employee has to follow all lawful and reasonable instructions by the employer.\n\nHe added that it can be argued that an employee is carrying out an act of insubordination by refusing to be vaccinated under the circumstances, as the employee is wilfully disobeying a lawful and reasonable order issued by the employer.\n\n\u201cAny punishment or action by the employer in response to insubordination has to be reasonable or proportionate, and it can be said here that where the result of the employee\u2019s vaccination is that the business would not be allowed to operate, there are serious repercussions and therefore termination of employment is a reasonable response by the employer.\n\n\u201cAnother potential justification for termination of employment is that an unvaccinated employee would be unable to perform the job or service for which the employee was employed. This would be the case if an unvaccinated employee is not permitted by law to work.\n\n\u201cIn such a situation, it may be reasonable for an employer to deem that the employment contract cannot be performed and therefore can be terminated,\u201d he said.\n\n3. What if an employee says no to vaccination due to health conditions?\n\nAs for employees who are unable to receive COVID-19 vaccinations due to a medical condition, van Geyzel said employers could explore measures such as redesignation.\n\n\u201cFirstly, I don\u2019t think the government would make vaccinations mandatory for such employees.\n\n\u201cSecondly, even if the government issued a blanket requirement, the employer should see if it\u2019s possible to apply for an exemption for that employee, or again see if redeployment or redesignation is an option.\n\n\u201cTermination should always be a last resort, but if the employer has acted reasonably, then termination should be possible under the law,\u201d he said, also saying that an employee would be unlikely to succeed in an unfair dismissal claim if an employer treated the employee fairly and could show that the termination was reasonable in the circumstances.\n\nFor employees with pre-existing health conditions that prevent them from being vaccinated, employment lawyer Jayasingam Poopalasingam said employers can seek to take mitigation measures such as changing their work roles or have them work remotely.\n\nHowever, if the nature of the business and nature of the employee\u2019s work requires vaccination, but vaccination is not possible due to the health condition and mitigating measures are not feasible through no fault of both the employer or the employee, the employer may be left with no choice but to terminate employment.\n\nThe employee could under such circumstances file a complaint to claim that the dismissal was without just cause and excuse, but it would ultimately be for the Industrial Court to decide if the dismissal was with just cause and excuse, he said.\n\n4. Putting it into the employment contract and putting it in writing\n\nJayasingam, who is also co-chair of the Bar Council\u2019s Industrial and Employment Law Committee, similarly said there are currently no laws that mandate COVID-19 vaccination for employees.\n\nThis means that for existing employees, an employer cannot \u201cforce\u201d them to be vaccinated, but can only seek to persuade and convince the employee of the need to be vaccinated due to reasons such as the nature of the work.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing much you can do, you cannot force the employee to go for vaccination, you cannot force an employee to undergo a medical procedure, it has to be by way of consent,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf they are existing employees, it must be by way of consent. They have a right to refuse vaccination, that\u2019s why we advise employers to obtain the written consent of employees to be vaccinated,\u201d he said, explaining that a mere verbal consent is not advisable as an employee could later claim to have never given consent.\n\nFor employees who pose a high risk due to the nature of their job as a frontliner or being in contact with others but refuse vaccination, employers can transfer them to another position where they do not deal with customers or other employees, he said.\n\nBut for new employees, an employer can make being vaccinated against COVID-19 a part of the employment contract prior to them joining the company, he said.\n\n\u201cYou cannot force it but what you can do is if you are having new employees, you can put it as a term of the contract, where they must be vaccinated before they are hired for employment, or they must undertake they will be vaccinated after they join you,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the new recruit would have the option of not joining the company upon viewing the contract, while employers can terminate employment if the new hire subsequently does not comply with instructions to be vaccinated as promised under the contract.\n\n5. About legal action\n\nIf an employer forces an employee to undergo COVID-19 vaccination, the employee can possibly walk out of the job and try to claim \u201cconstructive dismissal\u201d, Jayasingam said.\n\nIn cases of constructive dismissal claims, the employer does not have to issue a letter of termination, but the employee is essentially claiming that the employer has done something in breach of his contractual rights and that the employer\u2019s conduct had resulted in the employee\u2019s resignation.\n\nSuch an employee could then seek to prove their case in the Industrial Court to claim for monetary compensation and reinstatement to the job with all previous benefits and rights unaffected, including the right to not be forced to be vaccinated, Jayasingam said. It would ultimately be for the Industrial Court to decide if there was constructive dismissal.\n\nAlternatively, employees can also file a claim in civil courts but this is usually not preferred as the compensation is very small, with most employees likely to go to the Industrial Court instead, he said.\n\nUnlike new employees who have agreed to being vaccinated under the employment contract and can be terminated for non-compliance, Jayasingam said employers could face labour complaints by existing employees if the latter are terminated over their non-vaccinated status.\n\n\u201cIf the employer terminates them for not being vaccinated, the employee can file a complaint of dismissal without just cause and excuse,\u201d he said, explaining the process as involving employees filing complaints with the Industrial Relations Department under the Human Resources Ministry within 60 days of dismissal to see whether it could be resolved amicably, with the matter to be referred by the department director-general to the Industrial Court if it cannot be resolved.\n\nBut in situations where it is a government requirement for staff to be vaccinated in order to operate, an employer may have reason to terminate an employee who refuses to get vaccinated if it affects the business, Jayasingam said.\n\n\u201cSo the employer may have just cause and excuse to terminate the employee because he cannot carry on business,\u201d he said.\n\nJayasingam gave a hypothetical example, where an employee who works as a carer at a nursing home refuses to be vaccinated when it is a government requirement for such work, and the carer may as a result pose a risk to the elderly persons at the nursing home.\n\nIn such a situation and where there are no mitigation measures possible, the employer \u2014 who is unable to force the employee to be vaccinated \u2014 may opt to terminate the employee as it affects the business or may result in the nursing home having to be closed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s for the Industrial Court to decide whether what the employer did was reasonable or not,\u201d he said.\n\n6. Can the government make COVID-19 vaccination mandatory for employees?\n\nVan Geyzel said there may be a stronger basis for a compulsory vaccination requirement by the government for certain industries.\n\n\u201cThe laws that have been passed in response to the pandemic grant the government very broad powers to impose SOPs or pre-conditions for businesses to operate, and when it comes to roles or industries that have clear and frequent face-to-face contact and interaction with the general public, there is a stronger justification for the authorities to impose mandatory vaccination requirements. This is especially so as vaccinations are widely available and accessible.\n\n\u201cHowever, if the government overreaches and tries to impose mandatory vaccinations on other roles or industries where there is no clear face-to-face interaction or risk, I could see this being open to legal challenge,\u201d he said.\n\nJayasingam said the government could impose mandatory vaccinations on the general population including employees by passing an Act in Parliament, but believes that implementing such a policy of forcing vaccinations would only be a \u201clast resort.\u201d \u2014 Malay Mail", "keyword": ["vaccination", "employee", "employer", "say", "staff", "heres", "employers", "lawyers", "employees", "employment", "mandatory", "covid19", "vaccinated", "reasonable", "vaccinations"], "summary": "\u201cYes, if the MDTCA/KPDNHEP makes employee vaccinations mandatory or a pre-condition for approval to operate, the affected employers can impose this requirement on employees,\u201d he told Malay Mail.\n\u201cIn general, it would be very unlikely for an employee to successfully challenge an employer\u2019s mandatory vaccination policy where vaccinations have been declared a pre-condition for operations by the government.\n\u201cFirstly, I don\u2019t think the government would make vaccinations mandatory for such employees.\nCan the government make COVID-19 vaccination mandatory for employees?\n\u201cHowever, if the government overreaches and tries to impose mandatory vaccinations on other roles or industries where there is no clear face-to-face interaction or risk, I could see this being open to legal challenge,\u201d he said.", "news": "SoyaCincau.com", "date": "2021-08-02 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Ministry mulls proposal to control price of Covid-19 test kit", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbGF5bWFpbC5jb20vbmV3cy9tYWxheXNpYS8yMDIxLzA4LzAzL21pbmlzdHJ5LW11bGxzLXByb3Bvc2FsLXRvLWNvbnRyb2wtcHJpY2Utb2YtY292aWQtMTktdGVzdC1raXQvMTk5NDkwMtIBfGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbGF5bWFpbC5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wOC8wMy9taW5pc3RyeS1tdWxscy1wcm9wb3NhbC10by1jb250cm9sLXByaWNlLW9mLWNvdmlkLTE5LXRlc3Qta2l0LzE5OTQ5MDI?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://media2.malaymail.com/resize_cache/uploads/articles/2021/2021-07/covid_test_kit2_26072021-seo.jpg", "text": "Deputy Minister Datuk Rosol Wahid said based on feedback from the public, the test kit price is a burden especially to the low-income groups and families with many children. \u2014 Bernama pic\n\nFollow us on Instagram and subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates.\n\nKUALA BERANG, Aug 3 \u2015 The Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) is considering a proposal to control the price of the Covid-19 test kit, said Deputy Minister Datuk Rosol Wahid.\n\nHe said based on feedback from the public, the test kit price is a burden especially to the low-income groups and families with many children.\n\n\u201cWe were told that the price is RM39.90 each, not many can afford to buy it at that price.

Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on household income and made more people poorer, according to a study conducted by the Department of Statistics.\n\nThe Covid-19 impact study on household income in Malaysia for 2020 revealed that the number of poor households increased to 639,800 in 2020, up from 405,400 in 2019.\n\nThe findings of the study are contained in the Household Income Estimates and Incidence of Poverty Report, Malaysia, 2020 which the department released today.\n\nChief Statistician Datuk Seri Dr Mohd Uzir Mahidin said in a statement that the incidence of absolute poverty also increased, from 5.6 per cent in 2019 to 8.4 per cent in 2020, and that the incidence of hardcore poverty is estimated to increase from 0.4 per cent (2019) involving 27,200 households to 1.0 per cent involving 78,000 households.\n\nHe said the pandemic had also affected the structure of household groups, with 20 per cent of households from the M40 group with income between RM4,850 and RM10,959 having moved to the B40 group.\n\n\u201cHouseholds in the T20 group were also affected by the Covid-19 pandemic where 12.8 per cent of this group has shifted to the M40 group,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also said that as the percentage decrease in income for B40 and M40 households was larger than the T20 households group, the income distribution for B40 and M40 declined to 15.9 per cent (2019: 16.0 per cent) and 36.9 per cent (2019: 37.2 per cent), respectively.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the T20 group owned 47.2 per cent of income increased by 0.4 percentage points from 2019,\u201d he added.\n\nMohd Uzir said the mean of monthly household gross income decreased by negative 10.3 per cent to record RM7,089 as compared to RM7,901 in 2019 and added that the decline was contributed by households or individuals who experienced loss or reduction of income, particularly those with the status of employee, self-employed and others.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, this reduction of income was not only caused by job loss but also contributed by the reduction of working hours and increase in skill-related underemployment,\u201d he said.\n\nMohd Uzir said that all territories/states recorded a decline in mean and median of monthly household gross income. The Federal Territory of Putrajaya registered the lowest reduction in monthly household income and remained to record the highest mean and median of monthly household gross income as compared to other territories/states with RM12,322 and RM9,743, respectively.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, Kelantan remained to record the lowest mean and median income with RM4,411 and RM3,010, respectively,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also said that the incidence of absolute poverty by state shows that Sabah recorded the highest percentage of 25.3 per cent (2019: 19.5 per cent) while Kelantan recorded a significant increase in poverty by 8.8 percentage points to 21.2 per cent from 12.4 per cent (2019), followed by Terengganu by 5.9 percentage points to 12 per cent from 6.1 per cent (2019).\n\nMohd Uzir said the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic may be temporary as the economy is expected to improve and recover as the spread of the pandemic can be contained.\n\n\u201cFrom this analysis, it is found that the role of the federal and state governments as well as other relevant parties is pertinent in cushioning the impact of the pandemic as well as towards reviving the household income and the country\u2019s economy,\u201d he said.- Bernama", "keyword": ["study", "households", "poverty", "2019", "income", "household", "cent", "covid19", "uzir", "impact", "pandemic", "reveals", "percentage", "group", "significant"], "summary": "KUALA LUMPUR: The Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on household income and made more people poorer, according to a study conducted by the Department of Statistics.\nThe Covid-19 impact study on household income in Malaysia for 2020 revealed that the number of poor households increased to 639,800 in 2020, up from 405,400 in 2019.\nThe findings of the study are contained in the Household Income Estimates and Incidence of Poverty Report, Malaysia, 2020 which the department released today.\nMohd Uzir said that all territories/states recorded a decline in mean and median of monthly household gross income.\nThe Federal Territory of Putrajaya registered the lowest reduction in monthly household income and remained to record the highest mean and median of monthly household gross income as compared to other territories/states with RM12,322 and RM9,743, respectively.", "news": "The Sun Daily", "date": "2021-08-06 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Not so slick: Domestic Trade Ministry foils attempt to misappropriate 18,000kg of cooking oil", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEEHgxPt-i917aEqtS9q5XVIqGQgEKhAIACoHCAow-N7eCjC60NYBMLfbhwM?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Santhakumar A L"], "top-image": "https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2021/08/11/1252988.jpg", "text": "SHAH ALAM (Bernama): The Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry has foiled an attempt to misappropriate 18,000kg of cooking oil, 8,775 kg of which were subsidised 1kg packets.\n\nThe ministry's Selangor director Muhammad Zikril Azan Abdullah said raids carried out on two stores in Puchong found that the embezzlement activity was done by cutting the 1kg packets of subsidised cooking oil and transferring them to a skid tank to be bottled as 2kg and 5kg and sold for higher prices.\n\nHe said four locals and a foreigner, suspected to be an Indonesian, between the age of 30 and 50, identified as the owners of the premises were arrested to assist in the investigation.\n\nHe added that two lorries, a skid tank, forklift, cut 1kg plastic packets and bottles of cooking oil used to make the transfer were confiscated.

earnings in the second half of the financial year 2021 (2H21), underpinned by higher exports volume and refining margins.\n\nCGS-CIMB Securities Sdn Bhd analysts Nagulan Ravi and Ivy Ng Lee Fang, in a research report, stated that MSM have rightly hedged 99% of its financial year 2021 forecast (FY21F) domestic wholesale raw sugar requirement at US$0.13 (RM0.55) to US$0.14 per pounds (lbs) and 43% of its FY22F requirement at US$0.15-0.16/lbs.\n\nLast year\u2019s raw sugar price averaged at US$0.13-0.14/lbs.\n\n\u201cThis bodes well for MSM given raw sugar prices have been trending higher over the past 18 months to US$0.185/lbs currently, due to supply disruptions in Brazil and Thailand,\u201d the analysts stated in the report yesterday, following a recent update from the company\u2019s management.\n\nThe analysts stated that MSM expects a 10% year-on-year (YoY) growth in its domestic sales volumes in FY21F and has raised its average selling prices (ASPs) for both the wholesale (up to the maximum ceiling price of RM2.69 per kg) and industry segments.\n\nThe higher ASPs and sales volumes would help boost MSM\u2019s domestic refining margins in 2H21F, they added.\n\nRavi and Ng further stated that MSM had secured export contracts worth 65% to 70% of its original 300,000MT export sales target for FY21F.\n\n\u201cThe group is now optimistic of delivering close to 350,000MT of export sales in FY21F, in line with our forecast of 340,000MT, which is a 25% YoY growth versus FY20,\u201d Ravi and Ng added.\n\nThey said the higher export volumes would be driven by stronger demand from its largest export destination, Vietnam, which accounts for around 50% of its exports, and other countries that have reopened from Covid-19 restrictions.\n\nIncreased demand for its value-added products such as liquid sugar, fine syrup and premix products could increase volumes.\n\nThe analysts viewed exports growth would lower refining costs at the group\u2019s refinery in Johor.\n\n\u201cPost the optimisation of its Johor refinery, MSM expects to achieve a 50% utilisation factor (UF) for its Johor refinery in 2H21.\n\n\u201cWe project the Johor refinery could return to the black in FY22F as we project a 52% UF for the year, driven by higher exports volumes,\u201d Ravi and Ng added.\n\nCGS-CIMB forecast MSM to deliver Ebitda margins of 10.9% to 12.4% in FY21-23F, led by higher domestic and export margins and more robust export volumes.\n\n\u201cWe raise our FY21-23F earnings per share forecast by 1.5% to 6.9% to reflect lower refining costs and higher export premiums.\n\n\u201cIn light of this, we raise our target price (TP) to RM1.69 based on a price/net tangible asset (P/ NTA) of 1.2 times (one standard deviation below MSM\u2019s 10-year average P/NTA) versus one time previously,\u201d the analysts wrote.\n\nThe brokerage firm also upgraded MSM to \u2018Add\u2019 as the stock offers a 25% upside to its TP and attractive dividend yields of 6.1% to 7.5% in FY21-23F.\n\nFurther key catalysts include potential equity placements to collaborative partners and the completion of the sale of MSM Perlis, which will allow the MSM group to book a one-off

integrated nature of the Asean\u2019s supply chain, the impact from Vietnam\u2019s Covid-19 woes which culminated in the extension of lockdown measures under the government\u2019s Directive 16 in various provinces in the south are felt by Malaysian businesses that have a presence there.\n\nThe directive stipulates the closure of non-essential businesses, ban on public gatherings and severely limited transport services, in an attempt to contain the wave of Covid Delta variant infections.\n\nIn the past, Vietnam enjoyed success in containing the pandemic attributed to prompt border closure and lockdown measures, as well as an extensive testing and contact tracing strategy.\n\nVietnam recorded 8,324 new Covid-19 cases on Friday, according to the country\u2019s Ministry of Health. The new infections brought the total tally to 193,381, with 3,016 deaths, the ministry said.\n\nCurrently, 19 southern localities in the country, including Ho Chi Minh City, have implemented a lockdown via Directive 16 until Aug 16.

It is assessing the impact of the closure on its financial performance and announcements will be made if there is any material development.\n\nPoh Huat Resources Holdings Bhd\n\nThe group\u2019s subsidiary, Poh Huat Furniture Industries Vietnam Joint Stock Co, which has factories in Binh Duong Province and Dong Nai Province, has halted production activities in line with the lockdown order. As of July 21, it said none of its employees in the two locations has exhibited any Covid-19 symptoms and it will undertake screening and quarantine measures should any employee exhibit symptoms or be confirmed positive of the virus.\n\nConsequently, the production interruption is expected to cause delay in the shipment of orders to its customers in the US. Poh Huat\u2019s management is in discussions with affected customers to reschedule their delivery dates for affected orders.

These criteria must be publicised so that any future decisions will be solely based on evidence,\u201d MHC explained.\n\nAdditionally, the coalition said the government should clarify the specifics of these relaxed restrictions, because blanket vaccine privileges will create loopholes that will impede NRP.\n\n\u201cFor example, the government must answer questions like: What is the rationale to allow home quarantine for vaccinated travellers, how long is the quarantine and how will we monitor? How do we close the loopholes that may allow \u2018inter-state vacations on the pretext of visiting our children?\u2019\u201d it said.\n\nMeanwhile, Malaysian Medical Association (MMA) president Datuk Dr Subramaniam Muniandy said the decision to relax restrictions must be supported with sufficient scientific evidence.\n\n\u201cIf it is indeed a decision based on science, why then is travel allowed for those wishing to see their spouse or their young children? Either it\u2019s sufficiently safe for the fully vaccinated to travel, in which case all vaccinated individuals should be allowed to do so, or it is not, in which nobody should travel,\u201d he said.\n\nHe noted that some of those states in Phase 2 are showing an increasing trend in Covid-19 cases.\n\n\u201cThe government should stop its hyping up on the total number of cases. What is important are hospital bed utilisation and the intensive care units (ICUs) situation in the country,\u201d Dr Subramaniam said.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, we hope that the government will provide an update on the positivity rate and the status of bed utilisation and ICUs in each state as these will be more meaningful indicators apart from the daily new cases. It is important that the public be kept informed of the bed capacity and ICUs status in their respective state,\u201d he added.\n\nMMA also said that the lifting of restrictions must also take into

skin and hair.\n\nETX Daily Up is focussing on a few that should help convince you to either concoct your own treatments, or embrace some of the numerous cosmetic formulations based on this precious ingredient.\n\nCaffeine, an active ingredient that shouldn\u2019t be ignored\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon to find cosmetics formulated with caffeine, an active ingredient known for its slimming and firming benefits.\n\nGenerally, it is found in creams, gels, and other beauty products designed to help lose a few centimetres on the hips, thighs, or buttocks, as well as in anti-cellulite products or formulations designed to help users improve toning or firmness.\n\nBut caffeine is also present in certain facial care products, again with the aim of fighting skin slackening, but also \u2013 and above all \u2013 to improve the appearance of the eye contour area and reduce puffiness and dark circles (it can be even more effective if the product has spent some time in the refrigerator).\n\nCreams, gels, masks, cleansers: caffeine is nowadays found in products at all price points in the cosmetic departments of department stores and specialised shops.\n\nIn the form of powder and grounds\n\nWith the advent of DIY beauty, coffee now shows up in many so-called \u201chomemade\u201d recipes in the form of powder or grounds.\n\nRich in caffeine, these formulations can offer the advantages mentioned above, but are also powerful antioxidants, which allows them to fight against certain effects seen on mature skins, and more generally against skin aging.\n\nIn addition to these inherent virtues, coffee grounds, thanks to their specific texture, also make for a great exfoliant for sloughing off dead cells.\n\nAll you need to do is mix it with other ingredients: egg white for a mask, vegetable oil and honey for a face and body scrub, or even on its own to exfoliate scalp and hair to make it shinier.\n\nOver on TikTok, known for being the go-to social network for DIY beauty recipes, one can also discover a multitude of recipes for masks and scrubs made from soluble coffee or coffee beans.\n\nRecipes that users seem to have not only tested but also

collaborating with GE Digital on aircraft fuel efficiency monitoring solutions as part of the carrier\u2019s initiatives to meet its sustainability goals.\n\nThe national flag carrier adopted GE Digital\u2019s Fuel Insight and FlightPulse aviation software to transform and modernise the airline\u2019s fuel efficiency programme.\n\nMAB has implemented various initiatives including efficiency measures, investments in sustainability solutions and waste reduction across its operations to address its sustainability goals.\n\nThe fuel efficiency programme has been running for over a decade, contributing to a 15% fuel burn improvement recorded over the past eight years.\n\nMAB\u2019s group operations officer, Ahmad Luqman Mohd Azmi, stated promoting sustainability in all of the MAB\u2019s operations has always been a top priority.\n\nHe said digitalisation is a core component of the airlines\u2019 long term business plan and such efforts bring immediate value especially in the area of fuel efficiency.\n\n\u201cWe are looking forward to such a partnership that contributes to the airline\u2019s efforts to accelerate our sustainability target.\n\n\u201cThrough these solutions, we seek to play a greater part in building a legacy for future generations and enhancing our own airline\u2019s sustainability efforts,\u201d Ahmad Luqman said in a statement yesterday.\n\nFuel Insight is a cost and emissions monitoring solution that works by understanding data from the aircraft to uncover valuable intelligence that helps increase fuel efficiency and reduce waste.\n\nIt also gives operators actionable intelligence at multiple levels allowing analysts to drill down macro trends to understand issues on a per-flight level.\n\nThe software uses GE Digital\u2019s Event Measurement System (EMS) aviation data and analytics platform to merge flight data with flight plans, load sheets and fuel uplift data, identify the most attainable fuel savings opportunities, and track the incremental savings across the operation.\n\nFlightPulse, meanwhile, puts data directly into the hands of pilots, allowing them to visualise their savings over time.\n\nPilots who understand their own performance can adjust their flight plans to maximise safety and fuel efficiency.\n\nSecure benchmarking and data sharing allows crew members to see their contribution to projects and dramatically shortens the feedback loop.\n\nMAB evaluated the software with an extensive team of pilots, dispatchers and analysts who endorsed the software solution, which is hosted on GE Digital\u2019s EMS platform.\n\nEMS is built on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform providing compute, data, and security services.\n\nGE Digital\u2019s GM of the aviation software business Andrew Coleman said the company is committed to environmental excellence and that includes ensuring its customers are empowered to reduce the impact of their technology and environmental footprint within their operations.\n\n\u201cThese solutions will help MAB to leverage software to improve efficiency and reduce carbon emissions,\u201d Coleman added.\n\nThe solution will be implemented by the GE Digital aviation software teams in Austin, Texas and Shanghai, China.\n\nAdditionally, GE Digital provides MAB with the tools to build its big data analytics and leverage modern tools for data analysis

But fans in Malaysia have something to look forward to as two locals are working on a real-life version of the game \u2013 and this time, you can finally taste your veggies.\n\nWith the help of artificial intelligence and, in the near future, drones, Aquaville Asia hopes to become the world\u2019s first aquaponics farm where subscribers can nurture actual crops through their phones.\n\nFeeling like kale this week but kangkung the next? No problem, just tap on your screen and come harvest day, you will be greeted at your doorstep with fresh greens harvested from your own aquaponic plot.\n\nThat\u2019s the plan, at least \u2013 but for the time being, the concept is already in motion where subscribers can get five packs of vegetables delivered four times a month, with optional tilapia fish.\n\nAquaville founder Chia Weng Yan tells FMT that the idea came to him in the middle of the night. \u201cI dreamt about it and jotted down \u2018FarmVille in real life\u2019,\u201d the 40-year-old says.\n\n\u201cI created a pitch deck for it thinking it was a great idea, but didn\u2019t execute it and kept it on my computer for a long time,\u201d he adds, explaining that he struggled to find someone with the technological know-how to make his literal dream a reality.\n\nThen, in July last year, Chia found the perfect person for the job.\n\nLoke Chung Eng had posted on Facebook about robotics and projects involving IOT, or \u201cinternet of things\u201d, a network of physical objects embedded with sensors, software and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data.\n\nA phone call later and Chia had joined forces with Loke, 33, to create Aquaville Asia. The duo worked for months on the concept.\n\nWhile Loke spent time programming the AI system, Chia reached out to urban farmers, friends and family members to get them on board.\n\nThe duo forged an alliance with AHA Services Malaysia, a farm run by urban agriculturalists who provide Aquaville with all their farming requirements, including maintenance, harvest and delivery of fresh produce to subscribers.\n\nChia and Loke leave the farming to these experts and do their share by equipping the farm with Aquaville\u2019s AI technology.\n\n\u201cWe provide them with smart-farm capabilities so if any subscriptions come in, they are ready to harvest and deliver the produce,\u201d Chia explains.\n\nHe adds that using AI, Loke created a way to spot diseases in crops using an NDVI camera that scans vegetables at different wavelengths \u201cso you know if they are dying ahead of time\u201d.\n\nThe AI system can even monitor pH levels, humidity, heat and water levels. All their crops are pesticide-free.\n\nAquaville was officially launched in January this year, and subscribers have been effusive about how lush and crisp their vegetables are, compared with those bought in a store.\n\nSome customers have also funnelled their harvests to the needy, among them three companies that donated to a special-needs home in Petaling Jaya \u2013 sending bundles of fresh greens to feed 74 children between January and June \u2013 as well as contributed towards the white flag movement.\n\nIn the near future, Chia and Loke aim to introduce an application and drone system that will swoop over crops and capture real-time footage. Subscribers will be able to monitor their greens and control them through the app.\n\nAdditionally, the duo hope to empower the less fortunate and provide deaf, mute and B40 families with job opportunities on the farm.\n\nIt may take a few years for this FarmVille dream to fully become a reality, but the Aquaville innovators are hopeful and looking forward to a bright and greener future.\n\nFor fresh produce at your door each week or to help the needy, contact Aquaville Asia via Facebook or check out their website.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["taste", "malaysias", "veggies", "provide", "ai", "loke", "crops", "system", "chia", "aquaville", "farmville", "subscribers", "fresh", "vegetables"], "summary": "PETALING JAYA: Thousands were left cropless and devastated last year when Zynga\u2019s popular game FarmVille announced the end of its 11-year legacy.\nBut fans in Malaysia have something to look forward to as two locals are working on a real-life version of the game \u2013 and this time, you can finally taste your veggies.\nAquaville founder Chia Weng Yan tells FMT that the idea came to him in the middle of the night.\nWhile Loke spent time programming the AI system, Chia reached out to urban farmers, friends and family members to get them on board.\nThe AI system can even monitor pH levels, humidity, heat and water levels.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-08-12 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "1989 Proton Black Knight Wins \u201cUnexceptional\u201d Award In UK Car Festival", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL2Z1bi8yMDIxLzA4LzAzLzE5ODktcHJvdG9uLWJsYWNrLWtuaWdodC13aW5zLXVuZXhjZXB0aW9uYWwtYXdhcmQtaW4tdWstY2FyLWZlc3RpdmFsL9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL2Z1bi8yMDIxLzA4LzAzLzE5ODktcHJvdG9uLWJsYWNrLWtuaWdodC13aW5zLXVuZXhjZXB0aW9uYWwtYXdhcmQtaW4tdWstY2FyLWZlc3RpdmFsL2FtcC8?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Azizul Rahman Ismail", "Maya Suraya"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Proton-Black-Knight.jpeg", "text": "Subscribe to our new Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates.\n\nThe Proton Saga is Malaysia\u2019s first car and was the symbol of the nation\u2019s success.

The colour of its bright and deep red seeds was the inspiration for the signature hue of the national car.\n\nHowever, the reality is, the name \u201cSaga\u201d was the winning entry in a competition held in 1984.\n\nThe winner, Staf Sarjan Ismail Jaafar said that the name is actually an acronym for Safety, Achievement, Greatness, and Ability.\n\nThey Don\u2019t Make Them Like They Used To\n\nThe first generation Saga had many iterations and was in production up to 1992.\n\nOne of its most notable versions of the Saga was a hatchback released in 1987 during the peak of popularity of a certain TV show starring a certain modified Pontiac Trans Am.\n\nThe hatchback was called the Proton Knight. It was later named Proton Saga Aeroback, perhaps for copyright reasons. But to be fair, the new name is more descriptive.\n\nAt the same time, the Proton Saga was also sold all over the world including the UK.\n\nIn fact, the UK even got versions of the Proton Saga that are not available in Malaysia.

This is the most likely scenario,\u201d said Le Parisien this morning.\n\n\u201cIt only seems to be a matter of hours,\u201d suggested sports daily L\u2019Equipe, which proclaimed \u201cwe are entering the most incredible days in the history of the French championship\u201d.\n\nBefore signing the contract in Paris, Messi will first have to undergo a medical examination.\n\nStressing no deals had been done, Messi conceded at his tearful farewell news conference in Barcelona yesterday that joining PSG was a \u201cpossibility\u201d.\n\nIn reality, they are the only club who can afford what is expected to be a deal worth \u20ac35 million a year for the 34-year-old Argentine.\n\n\u201cI gave everything for Barcelona from the first day that I arrived right to the last. I never imagined having to say goodbye,\u201d a tearful Messi told the news conference.\n\n\u201cI have still not come to terms with the reality of leaving this club now \u2013 I love this club.\u201d\n\nThis morning, the images of the Argentinian in tears leapt out from the pages of all the Spanish sports dailies such as Marca, AS and Sport.\n\nOne note of discord came from a group of Barcelona fans, represented by Parisian lawyer Juan Branco, who announced today their intention to lodge a complaint with the European Commission in connection with the rules of financial fair play that Barcelona and PSG must follow.\n\nThe group also intends to ask the French courts to suspend a possible transfer.\n\nMessi, widely considered the most gifted player in the history of the game, won 35 trophies at Barcelona after joining as a 13-year-old \u2013 including four Champions Leagues and 10 league titles while his 672 goals are a record tally for one club.\n\n\u2018Great for Ligue 1\u2019\n\nDespite offering to cut his salary by half to seal a new five-year deal which a club carrying debts of \u20ac1.2 billion and the player had agreed on, the agreement foundered on strict Spanish league salary restrictions.\n\nSome in France\u2019s Ligue 1 have mixed feelings about the impending arrival of Messi who will form a superstar attacking force alongside Kylian Mbappe and Neymar, who earns a reported \u20ac36 million a year and is a former Barcelona teammate of the Argentine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary for Ligue 1,\u201d said Metz coach Frederic Antonetti.\n\n\u201cBut for a purist like me, Messi should have finished his career at Barcelona.\u201d\n\nThis summer PSG have already added veteran Spanish defender Sergio Ramos from Real Madrid, where he won four Champions League crowns, and Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma.\n\nMessi is a free agent.\n\nRamos also arrived on a free transfer.\n\nA move to the Parc des Princes would mean a reunion with his Argentina international colleague Angel di Maria.\n\nAn added attraction is that coach Mauricio Pochettino, like Messi, started his career at Newell\u2019s Old Boys in Rosario, Argentina.\n\nPochettino has been giving nothing away on the arrival of Messi.\n\n\u201cThere have been lots of rumours. Lots of things are being said,\u201d he said as PSG laboured to a 2-1 win over Troyes in their opening game of the new league season.\n\nJorge Sampaoli, the Argentine coach of PSG\u2019s bitter rivals Marseille, said the arrival of Messi can only be good news for French football.\n\n\u201cIt would be great for Ligue 1, he\u2019s the best player in the world,\u201d said Sampaoli.\n\n\u201cFrench football has won a lot and grown a lot in recent seasons.\n\n\u201cEven if he goes to a club other than Marseille, it will be good. Everyone would be riveted.

year\u2019s Merdeka will be like no other, courtesy of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nWith most of the Klang Valley and other urban centres under strict lockdown, the usual display of patriotic sentiments will be somewhat drowned out by the pervasive gloom of the moment.\n\nYet, 27 artists have chosen to express their love for the country during the month of Merdeka by displaying their works in an online exhibition titled very simply \u201cJalur Gemilang\u201d.\n\nOpen for viewing until the end of the month, the exhibition is hosted by Artas Galeri, an art gallery based in Petaling Jaya.\n\nAccording to Roy Ng, Artas Galeri\u2019s director, plans were already underway to hold a physical Merdeka-themed exhibition in the months leading up to August.\n\nHowever, with the extension of MCO 3.0, it became painfully clear that Plan B would have to be executed.\n\n\u201cDue to the pandemic and the increasing number of cases, I decided to launch an online show with an e-catalogue instead,\u201d he said.\n\nThat way, art enthusiasts will still be able to view the art pieces themselves without leaving the safety of their homes.\n\n\u201cMost of these artists\u2019 works exhibited in the \u2018Jalur Gemilang\u2019 exhibition are based on our national flag\u2019s colours,\u201d Ng said, adding that a majority of them used copious amounts of red, yellow, blue and white in multiple art styles including abstract, still-life and figurative.\n\nAccording to him, the artists are a fascinating group made up of graduates fresh out of art school as well as senior artists who have made a name for themselves in the art world.\n\nFMT had the pleasure of interviewing six of the artists regarding their hopes for the country this Merdeka month.\n\nYuki Lim Xiao Mun, artist of the almost ethereal \u201cThe Paradise Land\u201d, had this to say: \u201cMy hope for this Merdeka month is that our country can be restored to good condition after the economic hardship caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nShe said it was also her sincere hope that Malaysia\u2019s leaders will lead the country down the right path by practising integrity in their leadership.\n\nLikewise, Fadzril Fakaruddin encouraged Malaysians to stay united no matter what the circumstances, so that together, they could be free of Covid-19 for good.\n\nWhile Hamir Soib hopes for better governance, fellow artist Najib Ahmad Bamadhaj is hopeful for a return to normalcy and the good \u2018ol pre-Covid days.\n\nNational unity is something that veteran artist, Awang Damit, believes is vital if the country is to survive these difficult times.\n\nAnd another artist, Zulkefli Talha, reminded Malaysians to love each other as fellow countrymen regardless of racial or religious differences.\n\n\u201cLeaders have to be good examples for the people. And both leaders and the people have to work together to end this pandemic and return Malaysia to its former glory.\u201d\n\nNg told FMT that the pandemic had been especially tough on many artists. The numerous lockdowns this past year and a half meant potential buyers were unable to view the artworks personally and as a consequence, there was little to no sales.\n\nHe said there was an urgent need for artists to find alternative avenues to display their work so that they could continue to earn a decent living.\n\nNg explained that things have not been looking up for artists for a while now. Prior to the pandemic, the sluggish economy meant artists struggled to make a sale. The lockdowns brought about by the pandemic, only made things worse.\n\n\u201cMost collectors and buyers prefer to see the pieces in person. There\u2019s a huge difference between seeing artworks personally and virtually,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen you view an artwork physically, you will be able to see the texture, notice the colour tones and spot the little details. That\u2019s something these virtual exhibitions sadly cannot offer.\u201d\n\nHowever, this has not dampened the spirit of art collectors such as Brendan Siva in regard to the \u201cJalur Gemilang\u201d exhibition.\n\n\u201cEach piece is unique as an individual interpretation and expression of what Malaysia represents and symbolises in the eyes of the artist. It reflects the rich cultural and social fabric of Malaysia and its people.\u201d\n\nAnother art collector, Bingley Sim added, \u201cThe different styles and approaches in the use of the red, blue, yellow and white colours in the artworks reflect the exuberant spirit of Malaysia.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe works in the \u2018Jalur Gemilang\u2019 exhibition this year are all about resilience, tenacity and hope,\u201d said fellow art collector Cheow Wee.\n\n\u201cArt is a topic that brings people together no matter what ethnicity or religious belief one belongs to.\u201d\n\nHe added that since artists too are experiencing a bad year, it is important for other Malaysians to step up and support them.\n\n\u201cWe want to urge local artists never to give up as many of us will support them in our own little ways. After all, Kita Jaga Kita.\u201d\n\nTo find out more about Artas Galeri, visit them on Instagram, Facebook or WhatsApp 010-9009363 for an e-catalogue.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["exhibition", "art", "local", "pandemic", "month", "works", "merdeka", "view", "artists", "mark", "country", "online", "artist"], "summary": "PETALING JAYA: There\u2019s no question that this year\u2019s Merdeka will be like no other, courtesy of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nYet, 27 artists have chosen to express their love for the country during the month of Merdeka by displaying their works in an online exhibition titled very simply \u201cJalur Gemilang\u201d.\nOpen for viewing until the end of the month, the exhibition is hosted by Artas Galeri, an art gallery based in Petaling Jaya.\nFMT had the pleasure of interviewing six of the artists regarding their hopes for the country this Merdeka month.\n\u201cWe want to urge local artists never to give up as many of us will support them in our own little ways.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-08-13 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "US smash world record in men\u2019s 4x100m medley relay", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9zcG9ydHMvMjAyMS8wOC8wMS91cy1zbWFzaC13b3JsZC1yZWNvcmQtaW4tbWVucy00eDEwMG0tbWVkbGV5LXJlbGF5L9IBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/us-relay-4x100-010821-ap.jpg", "text": "TOKYO: A storming butterfly leg from Caeleb Dressel powered the US to a new world record and the gold medal in the men\u2019s Olympic 4x100m medley relay final today.\n\nThe US team of Ryan Murphy, Michael Andrew, Dressel and Zach Apple touched in 3:26.78s to smash the global 3:27.28s mark set at the 2009 World Championships.\n\nBritain came second in 3:27.51s and Italy were third in 3:29.17s.\n\nThe Americans were trailing at 200m after Andrew\u2019s breaststroke leg against Britain\u2019s Adam Peaty but when Dressel hit the water that all changed.\n\nHe clawed back the lead, leaving Apple to finish the job.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["mens", "water", "4x100m", "leg", "medley", "trailing", "touched", "dressel", "record", "world", "zach", "apple", "todaythe", "smash", "relay", "tokyo"], "summary": "TOKYO: A storming butterfly leg from Caeleb Dressel powered the US to a new world record and the gold medal in the men\u2019s Olympic 4x100m medley relay final today.\nThe US team of Ryan Murphy, Michael Andrew, Dressel and Zach Apple touched in 3:26.78s to smash the global 3:27.28s mark set at the 2009 World Championships.\nBritain came second in 3:27.51s and Italy were third in 3:29.17s.\nThe Americans were trailing at 200m after Andrew\u2019s breaststroke leg against Britain\u2019s Adam Peaty but when Dressel hit the water that all changed.\nHe clawed back the lead, leaving Apple to finish the job.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-08-01 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Meet Ita O\u2019Brian: in-demand intimacy coordinator", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9sZWlzdXJlL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvMjAyMS8wNy8zMC9tZWV0LWl0YS1vYnJpYW4taW4tZGVtYW5kLWludGltYWN5LWNvb3JkaW5hdG9yL9IBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ita-lifestyle.jpg", "text": "LONDON: Britain\u2019s Ita O\u2019Brien is one of entertainment\u2019s unsung stars, ensuring actors are comfortable filming their most sensitive scenes in a job she has made her own.\n\nThe 56-year-old intimacy coordinator has been a key figure behind sex scenes in acclaimed television series such as \u201cI May Destroy You\u201d, \u201cSex Education\u201d and \u201cNormal People\u201d.\n\nPreserving the intimacy of an artist filming a rape depiction, setting up a sex scene with a virgin actor, and identifying the limits each actor is comfortable with are all issues O\u2019Brien is regularly confronted with.\n\nA typical conversation she regularly has with stars, she says, goes along the lines of: \u201cHe is going to put his hand here, you put yours there and then you start the fellatio.\u201d\n\nShe sees her role as one of ensuring \u201copen communication\u201d between the director and the actors on all intimate scenes that may include kissing, nudity or sex.\n\n\u201cThis is a process by which we bring our professional structure to intimacy\u201d, allowing the on-screen stars to \u201cbring all of the skills of the actor to this moment,\u201d she adds.\n\n\u201cWe agree on a consent of touch and then a clear process by which we choreograph the intimate contact clearly. So it\u2019s just like dance.\u201d\n\nEach scene will be discussed and rehearsed beforehand, away from the glare of the dozens of people usually present on a set.\n\n\u201cWhen the camera rolls or they\u2019re up on stage, they know they can perform that intimate contact, knowing where they\u2019re going to be touched,\u201d she says.\n\nAt the heart of her philosophy is consent, in an industry which has been rocked in recent years by sexual assault claims. Her motto, which she says she often repeats to actors, is: \u201cYour \u2018no\u2019 is a gift. Tell us your \u2018no\u2019, so that we can trust your \u2018yes'\u201d.\n\n\u2018Incredibly hard\u2019\n\nO\u2019Brien was a dancer in the theatre for 10 years and then an actress for eight before she sensed an opportunity and became an intimacy coordinator in 2014.\n\nIt was a pioneering move at a time when actors\u2019 consent was little talked about, and before the #MeToo movement against sexual abuse and sexual harassment.\n\nBefore then, \u201cif an actor ever said \u2018no\u2019, they\u2019d be a troublemaker or a diva, and they would certainly be worried about losing their job,\u201d she recalls.\n\nIn such an environment, she describes her early days in the role as \u201cincredibly hard\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had productions where I\u2019ve been told not to speak to the director,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m serving the director\u2019s vision, but the director doesn\u2019t want to speak to me because he\u2019s a 74-year-old man, who basically doesn\u2019t want to acknowledge my existence.\u201d\n\nOn other occasions, she was not allowed on the set because the actors or director did not want her help.\n\nAttitudes have since changed a lot. The profession is becoming more popular and O\u2019Brien is in high demand, especially after Michaela Coel dedicated her best actress BAFTA win this year for \u201cI May Destroy You\u201d to her.\n\n\u201cThank you, Ita, for making a space safe, for creating physical, emotional and professional boundaries, so we can make work about exploitation, loss of respect, about abuse of powers,

Covid jabs per day and are moving towards increasing to 20,000 doses per day. \u2014 Picture by Sayuti Zainudin\n\nFollow us on Instagram and subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates.\n\nGEORGE TOWN, Aug 1 \u2014 Factories and small businesses in Penang, especially those hard hit by disruptions due to the Covid-19 pandemic, are looking forward to resuming operations as soon as possible even if it means making vaccination mandatory for their workers.\n\nAs there are currently no laws to enforce mandatory Covid-19 vaccination on workers, some companies are taking steps to get their workers to register for vaccination.\n\nPenang Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM) chairman Datuk Jimmy Ong said most factories here are encouraging their workers to register for their Covid jabs through various methods.\n\n\u201cSome companies are giving paid leave to their workers to go for vaccination and some are even offering monetary rewards,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the main reason multinational companies (MNC) are setting up Program Imunisasi Industri Covid-19 Kerjasama Awam-Swasta (Pikas) vaccination centres within their own factory grounds is to encourage their workers to get vaccinated.\n\nHe said the Pikas PPVs in Penang are now dispensing 15,000 doses per day and are moving towards increasing to 20,000 doses per day.\n\nHe said the vaccination of workers in MNCs is progressing very fast due to the on-site PPVs for larger factories which employ thousands of workers.\n\n\u201cIt is slower for small medium enterprises as they can only send their workers to the Pikas PPVs and there are only two of those now; one in Jawi and one at Equatorial Hotel,\u201d he said.\n\nEven with vaccination in full force, Ong said some of the companies in the manufacturing sector have continued to conduct screening of workers every two to three weeks.\n\n\u201cScreening still has to continue to control any potential spread of cases within the factories because we know, even those vaccinated still have a risk of contracting Covid-19,\u201d he said.\n\nFMM Penang branch offers a Penang SAFE programme for factories to conduct screening tests for its workers at a lower rate of RM60 per person.\n\nOng said the programme recommends that any company taking up the package conduct screening of 100 per cent of its staff in the first round.\n\n\u201cAfter that, they can conduct screening on 20 per cent of their staff for the second round and another 20 per cent on the third round, and so on,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, one of the SMEs in Penang, Chemdyes Sdn Bhd, has checked labour laws on ways to compel its employees to get vaccinated.\n\nThe company\u2019s managing director Joe Sidek said it was informed that there are at present no laws for the company to compel its employees to register for vaccination.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t legally force them to register for vaccination, it is a personal right, so what we do is to encourage them to do it as a way to safeguard everyone\u2019s safety in the workplace,\u201d he said.\n\nThe factory, specialising in textile chemicals, has about 22 workers and Joe said all have registered for vaccination.\n\nA nurse administers a dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at the Pikas vaccination centre at the Bukit Jawi Golf Resort in Penang June 17, 2021. \u2014 Picture by Sayuti Zainudin\n\nHe said despite the downturn in the textile industry due to the pandemic, Chemdyes recorded stable revenue last year and expects an increase in revenue this year.\n\n\u201cWe have kept all our staff and did not cut any pay so we have been very fortunate and we want to ensure that everyone is safe, we do not want to have any cases that could disrupt production,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said he would allow his workers to stay home for a week and to undergo screening tests if they have been exposed to places with a high number of Covid-19 cases.\n\nMeanwhile, it was reported that the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) is considering making vaccination of all employees in the retail sector one of the pre-conditions for approval for companies to resume operation, during the National Recovery Plan (NRP) period.\n\nYin\u2019s Sourdough Bakery and cafe co-founder Ong Seng Keat has already made it compulsory for all of its 40 workers to sign up for vaccination.\n\n\u201cWe will check our workers\u2019 MySejahtera to make sure they have registered and if we have to pay for it, we will,\u201d he said.\n\nHis company has already paid for all of his workers in Klang Valley to be vaccinated under a retail industry vaccination programme.\n\nHe hopes such programmes will be available in Penang so he can send all his workers to be vaccinated as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cThe government really needs to speed up its vaccination programme for the economic frontliners because we deal with people every day,\u201d he said.\n\nMugshot Cafe co-founder Jesse Tan agrees with Ong that vaccination for economic frontliners should be sped up.\n\n\u201cSo far, all of our staff have registered for vaccination but they are still waiting for their appointments,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of Mugshot\u2019s staff contracted Covid-19 a few months back due to close contact with a relative but fortunately, it did not spread to the other staff in the cafe.\n\n\u201cThere are 15 of us in the cafe and all of us went for screening the moment we found out he was positive but luckily, we were all negative,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the incident further emphasises the importance of vaccination for all workers who deal with customers daily.\n\nAs for Hin Bus Depot manager Tan Shih Thoe, he is also considering only allowing fully vaccinated vendors to participate in the Hin Bus Depot weekly bazaar, when they are finally allowed to reopen.\n\n\u201cI was just thinking about this, especially for the market, whether I should only allow vendors who are fully vaccinated to participate... main consideration is their safety since the market is considered a crowded space,\u201d he said.\n\nThere used to be 70 vendors at the weekly market before the pandemic but due to standard operating procedures (SOPs), the number of vendors came down to around 55 each week.\n\nThe market has been closed for more than two months due to the movement control order (MCO) and subsequent phases of the NRP.\n\nHin Bus Depot has around 15 tenants, consisting of eateries and artisans, and Tan said he will also strongly encourage the tenants and their workers to register for vaccination.\n\n\u201cMost of them are in favour of vaccination as they see it as the only solution to things getting back to normal,\u201d he said.\n\nFurry Kids pet shop owner Dalbinder Singh also agrees that it is important for those in the retail sector to be vaccinated.\n\n\u201cWe are meeting people and customers daily so it is important for the safety of everyone,\u201d he

Here\u2019s what you need to know:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Can employers make vaccination compulsory for employees?\n\nEmployment lawyer Donovan Cheah said there is no law now that disallows mandatory vaccination policies by employers, and that there are no known court cases in the country about whether such a policy would be legal.\n\n\u201cGiven the severity of the pandemic, having a mandatory vaccination policy is one of the ways for employers to safeguard the safety and health of their employees and curb the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cHowever, there are no reported court cases in Malaysia about the legality of mandatory vaccination policies, and whether an employer can take disciplinary action against an employee for refusing to vaccinate,\u201d he said, but noted there have been reported cases in countries like Australia and the US which upheld the dismissal of employees who refuse to comply with their employer\u2019s mandatory vaccination policy.\n\nSpecialist employment lawyer Marcus van Geyzel said employers would generally be able to make it compulsory for their employees to undergo COVID-19 vaccination if this is due to a government-imposed requirement.\n\n\u201cYes, if the MDTCA/KPDNHEP makes employee vaccinations mandatory or a pre-condition for approval to operate, the affected employers can impose this requirement on employees,\u201d he told Malay Mail.\n\n\u201cHowever, employers should be cautious where there are special circumstances, such as where an employee is unable to receive a vaccination due to a medical condition,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIn general, it would be very unlikely for an employee to successfully challenge an employer\u2019s mandatory vaccination policy where vaccinations have been declared a pre-condition for operations by the government.\n\nIn order to bring a successful legal action, an employee would have to show that in mandating vaccination, the employer has exercised its managerial power in a non-genuine manner, or that there was victimisation or an unfair labour practice,\u201d he said.\n\n2. What if the employees say no to vaccination?\n\nCheah said employers can choose to take disciplinary action against employees who refuse vaccination, and that whether such action is reasonable depends on the situation.\n\n\u201cWhile an employer cannot physically compel an employee to take the vaccine, an employee\u2019s freedom of choice is not the same thing as freedom from consequences. There are no legal prohibitions against an employer implementing a mandatory vaccination policy, although how employers deal with breaches of this policy may be evaluated by the courts,\u201d he said.\n\nCheah said disciplinary action including dismissal may be seen as reasonable, taking into account various factors.\n\nHe listed examples such as the employee\u2019s reason for refusal; whether the employee\u2019s refusal amounts to a breach of their duties or has caused loss or damage to the company or other employees; whether the employee\u2019s job function requires him/her to have regular and frequent physical interaction with third parties.\n\nOther factors listed by Cheah are the current severity of the pandemic; whether the employer\u2019s business deals with high-risk individuals; and whether vaccination is a pre-condition from the authorities for the employer to operate.\n\n\u201cWhere an employee has a legitimate reason to refuse vaccination (eg: health condition), employers should explore other ways to address the risk, such as requiring them to carry out their duties remotely and not allowing them to enter the premises without notice,\u201d Cheah added.\n\nVan Geyzel said employers would have several options, when vaccinations are a precondition for operations but there are employees who refuse to get vaccinated.\n\nThese options are to engage with the employees, or to transfer employees to alternative roles, or to ultimately stop employing the employee.\n\n\u201cThe first step should always be for employers to have clear and open conversations with these employees to ensure that they understand the reason for the vaccination requirement.\n\n\u201cEmployers can also consider redesignating or redeploying the affected employees to other roles within the business which are not customer-facing and which may be exempted from the regulatory requirements,\u201d he said.\n\nIf redesignation and redeployment is not an option, employers would be legally able to terminate the employee\u2019s employment if it is reasonable in the circumstances, he said.\n\nVan Geyzel said there is a general legal expectation that an employee has to follow all lawful and reasonable instructions by the employer.\n\nHe added that it can be argued that an employee is carrying out an act of insubordination by refusing to be vaccinated under the circumstances, as the employee is wilfully disobeying a lawful and reasonable order issued by the employer.\n\n\u201cAny punishment or action by the employer in response to insubordination has to be reasonable or proportionate, and it can be said here that where the result of the employee\u2019s vaccination is that the business would not be allowed to operate, there are serious repercussions and therefore termination of employment is a reasonable response by the employer.\n\n\u201cAnother potential justification for termination of employment is that an unvaccinated employee would be unable to perform the job or service for which the employee was employed. This would be the case if an unvaccinated employee is not permitted by law to work.\n\n\u201cIn such a situation, it may be reasonable for an employer to deem that the employment contract cannot be performed and therefore can be terminated,\u201d he said.\n\n3. What if an employee says no to vaccination due to health conditions?\n\nAs for employees who are unable to receive COVID-19 vaccinations due to a medical condition, van Geyzel said employers could explore measures such as redesignation.\n\n\u201cFirstly, I don\u2019t think the government would make vaccinations mandatory for such employees.\n\n\u201cSecondly, even if the government issued a blanket requirement, the employer should see if it\u2019s possible to apply for an exemption for that employee, or again see if redeployment or redesignation is an option.\n\n\u201cTermination should always be a last resort, but if the employer has acted reasonably, then termination should be possible under the law,\u201d he said, also saying that an employee would be unlikely to succeed in an unfair dismissal claim if an employer treated the employee fairly and could show that the termination was reasonable in the circumstances.\n\nFor employees with pre-existing health conditions that prevent them from being vaccinated, employment lawyer Jayasingam Poopalasingam said employers can seek to take mitigation measures such as changing their work roles or have them work remotely.\n\nHowever, if the nature of the business and nature of the employee\u2019s work requires vaccination, but vaccination is not possible due to the health condition and mitigating measures are not feasible through no fault of both the employer or the employee, the employer may be left with no choice but to terminate employment.\n\nThe employee could under such circumstances file a complaint to claim that the dismissal was without just cause and excuse, but it would ultimately be for the Industrial Court to decide if the dismissal was with just cause and excuse, he said.\n\n4. Putting it into the employment contract and putting it in writing\n\nJayasingam, who is also co-chair of the Bar Council\u2019s Industrial and Employment Law Committee, similarly said there are currently no laws that mandate COVID-19 vaccination for employees.\n\nThis means that for existing employees, an employer cannot \u201cforce\u201d them to be vaccinated, but can only seek to persuade and convince the employee of the need to be vaccinated due to reasons such as the nature of the work.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing much you can do, you cannot force the employee to go for vaccination, you cannot force an employee to undergo a medical procedure, it has to be by way of consent,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf they are existing employees, it must be by way of consent. They have a right to refuse vaccination, that\u2019s why we advise employers to obtain the written consent of employees to be vaccinated,\u201d he said, explaining that a mere verbal consent is not advisable as an employee could later claim to have never given consent.\n\nFor employees who pose a high risk due to the nature of their job as a frontliner or being in contact with others but refuse vaccination, employers can transfer them to another position where they do not deal with customers or other employees, he said.\n\nBut for new employees, an employer can make being vaccinated against COVID-19 a part of the employment contract prior to them joining the company, he said.\n\n\u201cYou cannot force it but what you can do is if you are having new employees, you can put it as a term of the contract, where they must be vaccinated before they are hired for employment, or they must undertake they will be vaccinated after they join you,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the new recruit would have the option of not joining the company upon viewing the contract, while employers can terminate employment if the new hire subsequently does not comply with instructions to be vaccinated as promised under the contract.\n\n5. About legal action\n\nIf an employer forces an employee to undergo COVID-19 vaccination, the employee can possibly walk out of the job and try to claim \u201cconstructive dismissal\u201d, Jayasingam said.\n\nIn cases of constructive dismissal claims, the employer does not have to issue a letter of termination, but the employee is essentially claiming that the employer has done something in breach of his contractual rights and that the employer\u2019s conduct had resulted in the employee\u2019s resignation.\n\nSuch an employee could then seek to prove their case in the Industrial Court to claim for monetary compensation and reinstatement to the job with all previous benefits and rights unaffected, including the right to not be forced to be vaccinated, Jayasingam said. It would ultimately be for the Industrial Court to decide if there was constructive dismissal.\n\nAlternatively, employees can also file a claim in civil courts but this is usually not preferred as the compensation is very small, with most employees likely to go to the Industrial Court instead, he said.\n\nUnlike new employees who have agreed to being vaccinated under the employment contract and can be terminated for non-compliance, Jayasingam said employers could face labour complaints by existing employees if the latter are terminated over their non-vaccinated status.\n\n\u201cIf the employer terminates them for not being vaccinated, the employee can file a complaint of dismissal without just cause and excuse,\u201d he said, explaining the process as involving employees filing complaints with the Industrial Relations Department under the Human Resources Ministry within 60 days of dismissal to see whether it could be resolved amicably, with the matter to be referred by the department director-general to the Industrial Court if it cannot be resolved.\n\nBut in situations where it is a government requirement for staff to be vaccinated in order to operate, an employer may have reason to terminate an employee who refuses to get vaccinated if it affects the business, Jayasingam said.\n\n\u201cSo the employer may have just cause and excuse to terminate the employee because he cannot carry on business,\u201d he said.\n\nJayasingam gave a hypothetical example, where an employee who works as a carer at a nursing home refuses to be vaccinated when it is a government requirement for such work, and the carer may as a result pose a risk to the elderly persons at the nursing home.\n\nIn such a situation and where there are no mitigation measures possible, the employer \u2014 who is unable to force the employee to be vaccinated \u2014 may opt to terminate the employee as it affects the business or may result in the nursing home having to be closed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s for the Industrial Court to decide whether what the employer did was reasonable or not,\u201d he said.\n\n6. Can the government make COVID-19 vaccination mandatory for employees?\n\nVan Geyzel said there may be a stronger basis for a compulsory vaccination requirement by the government for certain industries.\n\n\u201cThe laws that have been passed in response to the pandemic grant the government very broad powers to impose SOPs or pre-conditions for businesses to operate, and when it comes to roles or industries that have clear and frequent face-to-face contact and interaction with the general public, there is a stronger justification for the authorities to impose mandatory vaccination requirements. This is especially so as vaccinations are widely available and accessible.\n\n\u201cHowever, if the government overreaches and tries to impose mandatory vaccinations on other roles or industries where there is no clear face-to-face interaction or risk, I could see this being open to legal challenge,\u201d he said.\n\nJayasingam said the government could impose mandatory vaccinations on the general population including employees by passing an Act in Parliament, but believes that implementing such a policy of forcing vaccinations would only be a \u201clast resort.\u201d \u2014 Malay Mail", "keyword": ["vaccination", "employee", "employer", "say", "staff", "heres", "employers", "lawyers", "employees", "employment", "mandatory", "covid19", "vaccinated", "reasonable", "vaccinations"], "summary": "\u201cYes, if the MDTCA/KPDNHEP makes employee vaccinations mandatory or a pre-condition for approval to operate, the affected employers can impose this requirement on employees,\u201d he told Malay Mail.\n\u201cIn general, it would be very unlikely for an employee to successfully challenge an employer\u2019s mandatory vaccination policy where vaccinations have been declared a pre-condition for operations by the government.\n\u201cFirstly, I don\u2019t think the government would make vaccinations mandatory for such employees.\nCan the government make COVID-19 vaccination mandatory for employees?\n\u201cHowever, if the government overreaches and tries to impose mandatory vaccinations on other roles or industries where there is no clear face-to-face interaction or risk, I could see this being open to legal challenge,\u201d he said.", "news": "SoyaCincau.com", "date": "2021-08-02 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Ministry mulls proposal to control price of Covid-19 test kit", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbGF5bWFpbC5jb20vbmV3cy9tYWxheXNpYS8yMDIxLzA4LzAzL21pbmlzdHJ5LW11bGxzLXByb3Bvc2FsLXRvLWNvbnRyb2wtcHJpY2Utb2YtY292aWQtMTktdGVzdC1raXQvMTk5NDkwMtIBfGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbGF5bWFpbC5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wOC8wMy9taW5pc3RyeS1tdWxscy1wcm9wb3NhbC10by1jb250cm9sLXByaWNlLW9mLWNvdmlkLTE5LXRlc3Qta2l0LzE5OTQ5MDI?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://media2.malaymail.com/resize_cache/uploads/articles/2021/2021-07/covid_test_kit2_26072021-seo.jpg", "text": "Deputy Minister Datuk Rosol Wahid said based on feedback from the public, the test kit price is a burden especially to the low-income groups and families with many children. \u2014 Bernama pic\n\nFollow us on Instagram and subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates.\n\nKUALA BERANG, Aug 3 \u2015 The Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) is considering a proposal to control the price of the Covid-19 test kit, said Deputy Minister Datuk Rosol Wahid.\n\nHe said based on feedback from the public, the test kit price is a burden especially to the low-income groups and families with many children.\n\n\u201cWe were told that the price is RM39.90 each, not many can afford to buy it at that price.

Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on household income and made more people poorer, according to a study conducted by the Department of Statistics.\n\nThe Covid-19 impact study on household income in Malaysia for 2020 revealed that the number of poor households increased to 639,800 in 2020, up from 405,400 in 2019.\n\nThe findings of the study are contained in the Household Income Estimates and Incidence of Poverty Report, Malaysia, 2020 which the department released today.\n\nChief Statistician Datuk Seri Dr Mohd Uzir Mahidin said in a statement that the incidence of absolute poverty also increased, from 5.6 per cent in 2019 to 8.4 per cent in 2020, and that the incidence of hardcore poverty is estimated to increase from 0.4 per cent (2019) involving 27,200 households to 1.0 per cent involving 78,000 households.\n\nHe said the pandemic had also affected the structure of household groups, with 20 per cent of households from the M40 group with income between RM4,850 and RM10,959 having moved to the B40 group.\n\n\u201cHouseholds in the T20 group were also affected by the Covid-19 pandemic where 12.8 per cent of this group has shifted to the M40 group,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also said that as the percentage decrease in income for B40 and M40 households was larger than the T20 households group, the income distribution for B40 and M40 declined to 15.9 per cent (2019: 16.0 per cent) and 36.9 per cent (2019: 37.2 per cent), respectively.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the T20 group owned 47.2 per cent of income increased by 0.4 percentage points from 2019,\u201d he added.\n\nMohd Uzir said the mean of monthly household gross income decreased by negative 10.3 per cent to record RM7,089 as compared to RM7,901 in 2019 and added that the decline was contributed by households or individuals who experienced loss or reduction of income, particularly those with the status of employee, self-employed and others.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, this reduction of income was not only caused by job loss but also contributed by the reduction of working hours and increase in skill-related underemployment,\u201d he said.\n\nMohd Uzir said that all territories/states recorded a decline in mean and median of monthly household gross income. The Federal Territory of Putrajaya registered the lowest reduction in monthly household income and remained to record the highest mean and median of monthly household gross income as compared to other territories/states with RM12,322 and RM9,743, respectively.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, Kelantan remained to record the lowest mean and median income with RM4,411 and RM3,010, respectively,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also said that the incidence of absolute poverty by state shows that Sabah recorded the highest percentage of 25.3 per cent (2019: 19.5 per cent) while Kelantan recorded a significant increase in poverty by 8.8 percentage points to 21.2 per cent from 12.4 per cent (2019), followed by Terengganu by 5.9 percentage points to 12 per cent from 6.1 per cent (2019).\n\nMohd Uzir said the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic may be temporary as the economy is expected to improve and recover as the spread of the pandemic can be contained.\n\n\u201cFrom this analysis, it is found that the role of the federal and state governments as well as other relevant parties is pertinent in cushioning the impact of the pandemic as well as towards reviving the household income and the country\u2019s economy,\u201d he said.- Bernama", "keyword": ["study", "households", "poverty", "2019", "income", "household", "cent", "covid19", "uzir", "impact", "pandemic", "reveals", "percentage", "group", "significant"], "summary": "KUALA LUMPUR: The Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on household income and made more people poorer, according to a study conducted by the Department of Statistics.\nThe Covid-19 impact study on household income in Malaysia for 2020 revealed that the number of poor households increased to 639,800 in 2020, up from 405,400 in 2019.\nThe findings of the study are contained in the Household Income Estimates and Incidence of Poverty Report, Malaysia, 2020 which the department released today.\nMohd Uzir said that all territories/states recorded a decline in mean and median of monthly household gross income.\nThe Federal Territory of Putrajaya registered the lowest reduction in monthly household income and remained to record the highest mean and median of monthly household gross income as compared to other territories/states with RM12,322 and RM9,743, respectively.", "news": "The Sun Daily", "date": "2021-08-06 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Not so slick: Domestic Trade Ministry foils attempt to misappropriate 18,000kg of cooking oil", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEEHgxPt-i917aEqtS9q5XVIqGQgEKhAIACoHCAow-N7eCjC60NYBMLfbhwM?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Santhakumar A L"], "top-image": "https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2021/08/11/1252988.jpg", "text": "SHAH ALAM (Bernama): The Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry has foiled an attempt to misappropriate 18,000kg of cooking oil, 8,775 kg of which were subsidised 1kg packets.\n\nThe ministry's Selangor director Muhammad Zikril Azan Abdullah said raids carried out on two stores in Puchong found that the embezzlement activity was done by cutting the 1kg packets of subsidised cooking oil and transferring them to a skid tank to be bottled as 2kg and 5kg and sold for higher prices.\n\nHe said four locals and a foreigner, suspected to be an Indonesian, between the age of 30 and 50, identified as the owners of the premises were arrested to assist in the investigation.\n\nHe added that two lorries, a skid tank, forklift, cut 1kg plastic packets and bottles of cooking oil used to make the transfer were confiscated.

earnings in the second half of the financial year 2021 (2H21), underpinned by higher exports volume and refining margins.\n\nCGS-CIMB Securities Sdn Bhd analysts Nagulan Ravi and Ivy Ng Lee Fang, in a research report, stated that MSM have rightly hedged 99% of its financial year 2021 forecast (FY21F) domestic wholesale raw sugar requirement at US$0.13 (RM0.55) to US$0.14 per pounds (lbs) and 43% of its FY22F requirement at US$0.15-0.16/lbs.\n\nLast year\u2019s raw sugar price averaged at US$0.13-0.14/lbs.\n\n\u201cThis bodes well for MSM given raw sugar prices have been trending higher over the past 18 months to US$0.185/lbs currently, due to supply disruptions in Brazil and Thailand,\u201d the analysts stated in the report yesterday, following a recent update from the company\u2019s management.\n\nThe analysts stated that MSM expects a 10% year-on-year (YoY) growth in its domestic sales volumes in FY21F and has raised its average selling prices (ASPs) for both the wholesale (up to the maximum ceiling price of RM2.69 per kg) and industry segments.\n\nThe higher ASPs and sales volumes would help boost MSM\u2019s domestic refining margins in 2H21F, they added.\n\nRavi and Ng further stated that MSM had secured export contracts worth 65% to 70% of its original 300,000MT export sales target for FY21F.\n\n\u201cThe group is now optimistic of delivering close to 350,000MT of export sales in FY21F, in line with our forecast of 340,000MT, which is a 25% YoY growth versus FY20,\u201d Ravi and Ng added.\n\nThey said the higher export volumes would be driven by stronger demand from its largest export destination, Vietnam, which accounts for around 50% of its exports, and other countries that have reopened from Covid-19 restrictions.\n\nIncreased demand for its value-added products such as liquid sugar, fine syrup and premix products could increase volumes.\n\nThe analysts viewed exports growth would lower refining costs at the group\u2019s refinery in Johor.\n\n\u201cPost the optimisation of its Johor refinery, MSM expects to achieve a 50% utilisation factor (UF) for its Johor refinery in 2H21.\n\n\u201cWe project the Johor refinery could return to the black in FY22F as we project a 52% UF for the year, driven by higher exports volumes,\u201d Ravi and Ng added.\n\nCGS-CIMB forecast MSM to deliver Ebitda margins of 10.9% to 12.4% in FY21-23F, led by higher domestic and export margins and more robust export volumes.\n\n\u201cWe raise our FY21-23F earnings per share forecast by 1.5% to 6.9% to reflect lower refining costs and higher export premiums.\n\n\u201cIn light of this, we raise our target price (TP) to RM1.69 based on a price/net tangible asset (P/ NTA) of 1.2 times (one standard deviation below MSM\u2019s 10-year average P/NTA) versus one time previously,\u201d the analysts wrote.\n\nThe brokerage firm also upgraded MSM to \u2018Add\u2019 as the stock offers a 25% upside to its TP and attractive dividend yields of 6.1% to 7.5% in FY21-23F.\n\nFurther key catalysts include potential equity placements to collaborative partners and the completion of the sale of MSM Perlis, which will allow the MSM group to book a one-off gain from the disposal of the land of RM91.6 million at 13 sen per share.\n\nThe analysts attributed key risks to lower export margins and rising raw sugar prices.\n\nMSM is currently working on doubling its liquid sugar facility\u2019s capacity and enhancing its fine syrup facility due to the rising demand for these products.\n\nIn the longer term, the \u201cGula Prai\u201d producer plans to expand its export segment further by increasing its regional presence in the Asia-Pacific region and establishing a local presence in countries such as China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Singapore, Indonesia and South Korea.\n\nAs of 2019, MSM corroborated up to 60% of the domestic market share and ranked the eighth largest sugar refiner globally by capacity.\n\nMSM share price declined 2.22% to RM1.32 yesterday, valuing the company RM927.93 million.", "keyword": ["export", "earnings", "sugar", "poised", "2h", "higher", "domestic", "volumes", "refining", "msm", "stated", "sales", "stronger",

integrated nature of the Asean\u2019s supply chain, the impact from Vietnam\u2019s Covid-19 woes which culminated in the extension of lockdown measures under the government\u2019s Directive 16 in various provinces in the south are felt by Malaysian businesses that have a presence there.\n\nThe directive stipulates the closure of non-essential businesses, ban on public gatherings and severely limited transport services, in an attempt to contain the wave of Covid Delta variant infections.\n\nIn the past, Vietnam enjoyed success in containing the pandemic attributed to prompt border closure and lockdown measures, as well as an extensive testing and contact tracing strategy.\n\nVietnam recorded 8,324 new Covid-19 cases on Friday, according to the country\u2019s Ministry of Health. The new infections brought the total tally to 193,381, with 3,016 deaths, the ministry said.\n\nCurrently, 19 southern localities in the country, including Ho Chi Minh City, have implemented a lockdown via Directive 16 until Aug 16. Meanwhile, The lockdown in Hanoi, Vietnam\u2019s capital, has been extended by 15 days until Aug 22.\n\nAs a result, a number of Bursa Malaysia-listed issuers with facilities in Vietnam have reported suspension of operations there.\n\nYBS International Bhd\n\nIts subsidiary, Oriental Fastech Manufacturing (Vietnam), which is involved in high precision metal fabrication and assembly, is partially suspending its operations to comply with the government\u2019s directive.\n\nMagni-Tech Industries Bhd\n\nIts garment production facilities in Vietnam have been suspended in line with the government\u2019s directive. The group is mitigating the impact of the closure via close engagement with its customers to manage the production capacity challenges as well as rescheduling delivery dates to meet customer\u2019s demand. It is assessing the impact of the closure on its financial performance and announcements will be made if there is any material development.\n\nPoh Huat Resources Holdings Bhd\n\nThe group\u2019s subsidiary, Poh Huat Furniture Industries Vietnam Joint Stock Co, which has factories in Binh Duong Province and Dong Nai Province, has halted production activities in line with the lockdown order. As of July 21, it said none of its employees in the two locations has exhibited any Covid-19 symptoms and it will undertake screening and quarantine measures should any employee exhibit symptoms or be confirmed positive of the virus.\n\nConsequently, the production interruption is expected to cause delay in the shipment of orders to its customers in the US. Poh Huat\u2019s management is in discussions with affected customers to reschedule their delivery dates for affected orders. It said it is able to mitigate some of the impact from the closure as it has a certain amount of ready inventory to meet the orders and it will increase production with extended shifts upon resumption of production activities, if necessary.\n\nLatitude Tree Holdings Bhd\n\nTwo of the group\u2019s subsidiaries, Latitude Tree Vietnam Joint Stock Co and RK Resources Co Ltd, are partially suspending operations to comply with Vietnam\u2019s Directive 16.

This approach will allow it to operate at a reduced production capacity.\n\nLatitude Tree estimates the production loss from the \u20183 on the spot\u2019 approach to be around 1.2% to 1.8% of its total forecast annual output volume for FY2022.\n\n", "keyword": ["fallout", "grapple", "lockdown", "directive", "tree", "firms", "16", "vietnams", "production", "vietnam", "bursalisted", "closure", "customers", "covid", "impact", "presence", "malaysian"], "summary": "In the past, Vietnam enjoyed success in containing the pandemic attributed to prompt border closure and lockdown measures, as well as an extensive testing and contact tracing strategy.\nCurrently, 19 southern localities in the country, including Ho Chi Minh City, have implemented a lockdown via Directive 16 until Aug 16.\nAs a result, a number of Bursa Malaysia-listed issuers with facilities in Vietnam have reported suspension of operations there.\nMagni-Tech Industries BhdIts garment production facilities in Vietnam have been suspended in line with the government\u2019s directive.\nLatitude Tree Holdings BhdTwo of the group\u2019s subsidiaries, Latitude Tree Vietnam Joint Stock Co and RK Resources Co Ltd, are partially suspending operations to comply with Vietnam\u2019s Directive 16.", "news": "The Sun Daily", "date": "2021-08-08 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Introduce code of ethics for elected reps \u2013 Rais", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWJvcm5lb3Bvc3QuY29tLzIwMjEvMDgvMDcvaW50cm9kdWNlLWNvZGUtb2YtZXRoaWNzLWZvci1lbGVjdGVkLXJlcHMtcmFpcy_SAQA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2021/07/FW1176796_KL19_19072021_DEWAN-lpr.jpg", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR (Aug 7): Dewan Negara president Tan Sri Dr Rais Yatim has suggested that a code of ethics for elected representatives be introduced to members of Parliament and assemblymen to make them respected and exemplary leaders.\n\nIn his writing in the Journal of the Malaysian Parliament entitled \u2018Etika Legislatif untuk Wakil Rakyat\u2019 (Legislative Ethics for Elected Representatives), he said the code of ethics was also important to \u2018control\u2019 and \u2018discipline\u2019 elected representatives when taking part in debate sessions.\n\nRais said since Parliament is a place where the country\u2019s leaders are born, members must also consist of those with qualified academic qualifications and are well mannered.\n\nHowever, he said, in reality and based on the Parliament Hansard, the behavior, speech and debating style of elected representatives in the Malaysian Parliament was moving backward, he said, referring to the speech by three MPs who used offensive language in 2018.\n\nTherefore, Rais said changes in internal and external legislative work should be initiated, including the introduction of a code of ethics for the elected representatives that can be enforced in accordance with the Houses of Parliament (Privileges and Powers) Act 1952 (Act 347) or through the setting up of a special committee under Dewan Rakyat, Dewan Negara or state legislative assemblies.\n\nFor Dewan Negara, he said the motion to establish the code of ethics for elected representatives can be made under Standing Order 13 (2) 31 of the Senate.\n\nRais also suggested that training courses be given to MPs and assemblymen to ensure that they become elected representatives with integrity and have extensive legal knowledge.\n\n\u201cMake it mandatory for all elected representatives to undergo at least six months of training.

We propose postponing the relaxation to a time determined by a clear set of publicised criteria,\u201d Malaysia Health Coalition (MHC) said in a statement yesterday.\n\nThe coalition of medical experts added that at the moment, only 27% of the population of all ages were fully vaccinated, and this excludes undocumented migrants.\n\n\u201cChile only relaxed restrictions after 50% coverage, and Singapore is targeting relaxed restrictions at 70% coverage,\u201d MHC added.\n\nOn Sunday, Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin announced that among the restrictions being lifted for fully vaccinated individuals who reside in states under Phase 2 and above of the National Recovery Plan (NRP), include dine-ins, inter-district travel, sports and recreational activities without physical contact as well as tourism activities within the state involving homestays and hotels.\n\n\u201cIn allowing the relaxation, the government will also ensure public health strategic plans, which are now on the right track, continue to be implemented, especially through screenings, close contact detection, isolation measures, as well as improving healthcare capacity and treatment options,\u201d he said.\n\nMHC, however, stated that scientific and public health criteria for relaxation must be built by health experts without interference.\n\n\u201cThey can include \u2018fully vaccinated rate \u226570% of the total population, total critical care bed occupancy rate for Covid-19 of \u226490%, total daily new cases \u22644000 with share of positive tests \u22645%\u2019 and other criteria. These criteria must be publicised so that any future decisions will be solely based on evidence,\u201d MHC explained.\n\nAdditionally, the coalition said the government should clarify the specifics of these relaxed restrictions, because blanket vaccine privileges will create loopholes that will impede NRP.\n\n\u201cFor example, the government must answer questions like: What is the rationale to allow home quarantine for vaccinated travellers, how long is the quarantine and how will we monitor? How do we close the loopholes that may allow \u2018inter-state vacations on the pretext of visiting our children?\u2019\u201d it said.\n\nMeanwhile, Malaysian Medical Association (MMA) president Datuk Dr Subramaniam Muniandy said the decision to relax restrictions must be supported with sufficient scientific evidence.\n\n\u201cIf it is indeed a decision based on science, why then is travel allowed for those wishing to see their spouse or their young children? Either it\u2019s sufficiently safe for the fully vaccinated to travel, in which case all vaccinated individuals should be allowed to do so, or it is not, in which nobody should travel,\u201d he said.\n\nHe noted that some of those states in Phase 2 are showing an increasing trend in Covid-19 cases.\n\n\u201cThe government should stop its hyping up on the total number of cases. What is important are hospital bed utilisation and the intensive care units (ICUs) situation in the country,\u201d Dr Subramaniam said.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, we hope that the government will provide an update on the positivity rate and the status of bed utilisation and ICUs in each state as these will be more meaningful indicators apart from the daily new cases. It is important that the public be kept informed of the bed capacity and ICUs status in their respective state,\u201d he added.\n\nMMA also said that the lifting of restrictions must also take into account high-risk groups such as nursing homes, factory and construction workers, security guards, cleaners, medical students and undocumented migrant workers that have not been vaccinated.",

skin and hair.\n\nETX Daily Up is focussing on a few that should help convince you to either concoct your own treatments, or embrace some of the numerous cosmetic formulations based on this precious ingredient.\n\nCaffeine, an active ingredient that shouldn\u2019t be ignored\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon to find cosmetics formulated with caffeine, an active ingredient known for its slimming and firming benefits.\n\nGenerally, it is found in creams, gels, and other beauty products designed to help lose a few centimetres on the hips, thighs, or buttocks, as well as in anti-cellulite products or formulations designed to help users improve toning or firmness.\n\nBut caffeine is also present in certain facial care products, again with the aim of fighting skin slackening, but also \u2013 and above all \u2013 to improve the appearance of the eye contour area and reduce puffiness and dark circles (it can be even more effective if the product has spent some time in the refrigerator).\n\nCreams, gels, masks, cleansers: caffeine is nowadays found in products at all price points in the cosmetic departments of department stores and specialised shops.\n\nIn the form of powder and grounds\n\nWith the advent of DIY beauty, coffee now shows up in many so-called \u201chomemade\u201d recipes in the form of powder or grounds.\n\nRich in caffeine, these formulations can offer the advantages mentioned above, but are also powerful antioxidants, which allows them to fight against certain effects seen on mature skins, and more generally against skin aging.\n\nIn addition to these inherent virtues, coffee grounds, thanks to their specific texture, also make for a great exfoliant for sloughing off dead cells.\n\nAll you need to do is mix it with other ingredients: egg white for a mask, vegetable oil and honey for a face and body scrub, or even on its own to exfoliate scalp and hair to make it shinier.\n\nOver on TikTok, known for being the go-to social network for DIY beauty recipes, one can also discover a multitude of recipes for masks and scrubs made from soluble coffee or coffee beans.\n\nRecipes that users seem to have not only tested but also

collaborating with GE Digital on aircraft fuel efficiency monitoring solutions as part of the carrier\u2019s initiatives to meet its sustainability goals.\n\nThe national flag carrier adopted GE Digital\u2019s Fuel Insight and FlightPulse aviation software to transform and modernise the airline\u2019s fuel efficiency programme.\n\nMAB has implemented various initiatives including efficiency measures, investments in sustainability solutions and waste reduction across its operations to address its sustainability goals.\n\nThe fuel efficiency programme has been running for over a decade, contributing to a 15% fuel burn improvement recorded over the past eight years.\n\nMAB\u2019s group operations officer, Ahmad Luqman Mohd Azmi, stated promoting sustainability in all of the MAB\u2019s operations has always been a top priority.\n\nHe said digitalisation is a core component of the airlines\u2019 long term business plan and such efforts bring immediate value especially in the area of fuel efficiency.\n\n\u201cWe are looking forward to such a partnership that contributes to the airline\u2019s efforts to accelerate our sustainability target.\n\n\u201cThrough these solutions, we seek to play a greater part in building a legacy for future generations and enhancing our own airline\u2019s sustainability efforts,\u201d Ahmad Luqman said in a statement yesterday.\n\nFuel Insight is a cost and emissions monitoring solution that works by understanding data from the aircraft to uncover valuable intelligence that helps increase fuel efficiency and reduce waste.\n\nIt also gives operators actionable intelligence at multiple levels allowing analysts to drill down macro trends to understand issues on a per-flight level.\n\nThe software uses GE Digital\u2019s Event Measurement System (EMS) aviation data and analytics platform to merge flight data with flight plans, load sheets and fuel uplift data, identify the most attainable fuel savings opportunities, and track the incremental savings across the operation.\n\nFlightPulse, meanwhile, puts data directly into the hands of pilots, allowing them to visualise their savings over time.\n\nPilots who understand their own performance can adjust their flight plans to maximise safety and fuel efficiency.\n\nSecure benchmarking and data sharing allows crew members to see their contribution to projects and dramatically shortens the feedback loop.\n\nMAB evaluated the software with an extensive team of pilots, dispatchers and analysts who endorsed the software solution, which is hosted on GE Digital\u2019s EMS platform.\n\nEMS is built on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform providing compute, data, and security services.\n\nGE Digital\u2019s GM of the aviation software business Andrew Coleman said the company is committed to environmental excellence and that includes ensuring its customers are empowered to reduce the impact of their technology and environmental footprint within their operations.\n\n\u201cThese solutions will help MAB to leverage software to improve efficiency and reduce carbon emissions,\u201d Coleman added.\n\nThe solution will be implemented by the GE Digital aviation software teams in Austin, Texas and Shanghai, China.\n\nAdditionally, GE Digital provides MAB with the tools to build its big data analytics and leverage modern tools for data analysis

But fans in Malaysia have something to look forward to as two locals are working on a real-life version of the game \u2013 and this time, you can finally taste your veggies.\n\nWith the help of artificial intelligence and, in the near future, drones, Aquaville Asia hopes to become the world\u2019s first aquaponics farm where subscribers can nurture actual crops through their phones.\n\nFeeling like kale this week but kangkung the next? No problem, just tap on your screen and come harvest day, you will be greeted at your doorstep with fresh greens harvested from your own aquaponic plot.\n\nThat\u2019s the plan, at least \u2013 but for the time being, the concept is already in motion where subscribers can get five packs of vegetables delivered four times a month, with optional tilapia fish.\n\nAquaville founder Chia Weng Yan tells FMT that the idea came to him in the middle of the night. \u201cI dreamt about it and jotted down \u2018FarmVille in real life\u2019,\u201d the 40-year-old says.\n\n\u201cI created a pitch deck for it thinking it was a great idea, but didn\u2019t execute it and kept it on my computer for a long time,\u201d he adds, explaining that he struggled to find someone with the technological know-how to make his literal dream a reality.\n\nThen, in July last year, Chia found the perfect person for the job.\n\nLoke Chung Eng had posted on Facebook about robotics and projects involving IOT, or \u201cinternet of things\u201d, a network of physical objects embedded with sensors, software and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data.\n\nA phone call later and Chia had joined forces with Loke, 33, to create Aquaville Asia. The duo worked for months on the concept.\n\nWhile Loke spent time programming the AI system, Chia reached out to urban farmers, friends and family members to get them on board.\n\nThe duo forged an alliance with AHA Services Malaysia, a farm run by urban agriculturalists who provide Aquaville with all their farming requirements, including maintenance, harvest and delivery of fresh produce to subscribers.\n\nChia and Loke leave the farming to these experts and do their share by equipping the farm with Aquaville\u2019s AI technology.\n\n\u201cWe provide them with smart-farm capabilities so if any subscriptions come in, they are ready to harvest and deliver the produce,\u201d Chia explains.\n\nHe adds that using AI, Loke created a way to spot diseases in crops using an NDVI camera that scans vegetables at different wavelengths \u201cso you know if they are dying ahead of time\u201d.\n\nThe AI system can even monitor pH levels, humidity, heat and water levels. All their crops are pesticide-free.\n\nAquaville was officially launched in January this year, and subscribers have been effusive about how lush and crisp their vegetables are, compared with those bought in a store.\n\nSome customers have also funnelled their harvests to the needy, among them three companies that donated to a special-needs home in Petaling Jaya \u2013 sending bundles of fresh greens to feed 74 children between January and June \u2013 as well as contributed towards the white flag movement.\n\nIn the near future, Chia and Loke aim to introduce an application and drone system that will swoop over crops and capture real-time footage. Subscribers will be able to monitor their greens and control them through the app.\n\nAdditionally, the duo hope to empower the less fortunate and provide deaf, mute and B40 families with job opportunities on the farm.\n\nIt may take a few years for this FarmVille dream to fully become a reality, but the Aquaville innovators are hopeful and looking forward to a bright and greener future.\n\nFor fresh produce at your door each week or to help the needy, contact Aquaville Asia via Facebook or check out their website.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["taste", "malaysias", "veggies", "provide", "ai", "loke", "crops", "system", "chia", "aquaville", "farmville", "subscribers", "fresh", "vegetables"], "summary": "PETALING JAYA: Thousands were left cropless and devastated last year when Zynga\u2019s popular game FarmVille announced the end of its 11-year legacy.\nBut fans in Malaysia have something to look forward to as two locals are working on a real-life version of the game \u2013 and this time, you can finally taste your veggies.\nAquaville founder Chia Weng Yan tells FMT that the idea came to him in the middle of the night.\nWhile Loke spent time programming the AI system, Chia reached out to urban farmers, friends and family members to get them on board.\nThe AI system can even monitor pH levels, humidity, heat and water levels.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-08-12 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "1989 Proton Black Knight Wins \u201cUnexceptional\u201d Award In UK Car Festival", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL2Z1bi8yMDIxLzA4LzAzLzE5ODktcHJvdG9uLWJsYWNrLWtuaWdodC13aW5zLXVuZXhjZXB0aW9uYWwtYXdhcmQtaW4tdWstY2FyLWZlc3RpdmFsL9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL2Z1bi8yMDIxLzA4LzAzLzE5ODktcHJvdG9uLWJsYWNrLWtuaWdodC13aW5zLXVuZXhjZXB0aW9uYWwtYXdhcmQtaW4tdWstY2FyLWZlc3RpdmFsL2FtcC8?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Azizul Rahman Ismail", "Maya Suraya"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Proton-Black-Knight.jpeg", "text": "Subscribe to our new Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates.\n\nThe Proton Saga is Malaysia\u2019s first car and was the symbol of the nation\u2019s success. It says so in the jingle, if you are old enough to remember it.\n\nIntroduced in 1985, the name Saga was theorised to have a double meaning.\n\nIn English, it is defined as a long story of heroic achievement.\n\nIn Malay, it refers to the Adenanthera tree. The colour of its bright and deep red seeds was the inspiration for the signature hue of the national car.\n\nHowever, the reality is, the name \u201cSaga\u201d was the winning entry in a competition held in 1984.\n\nThe winner, Staf Sarjan Ismail Jaafar said that the name is actually an acronym for Safety, Achievement, Greatness, and Ability.\n\nThey Don\u2019t Make Them Like They Used To\n\nThe first generation Saga had many iterations and was in production up to 1992.\n\nOne of its most notable versions of the Saga was a hatchback released in 1987 during the peak of popularity of a certain TV show starring a certain modified Pontiac Trans Am.\n\nThe hatchback was called the Proton Knight. It was later named Proton Saga Aeroback, perhaps for copyright reasons.

Lots of things are being said,\u201d he said as PSG laboured to a 2-1 win over Troyes in their opening game of the new league season.\n\nJorge Sampaoli, the Argentine coach of PSG\u2019s bitter rivals Marseille, said the arrival of Messi can only be good news for French football.\n\n\u201cIt would be great for Ligue 1, he\u2019s the best player in the world,\u201d said Sampaoli.\n\n\u201cFrench football has won a lot and grown a lot in recent seasons.\n\n\u201cEven if he goes to a club other than Marseille, it will be good.

year\u2019s Merdeka will be like no other, courtesy of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nWith most of the Klang Valley and other urban centres under strict lockdown, the usual display of patriotic sentiments will be somewhat drowned out by the pervasive gloom of the moment.\n\nYet, 27 artists have chosen to express their love for the country during the month of Merdeka by displaying their works in an online exhibition titled very simply \u201cJalur Gemilang\u201d.\n\nOpen for viewing until the end of the month, the exhibition is hosted by Artas Galeri, an art gallery based in Petaling Jaya.\n\nAccording to Roy Ng, Artas Galeri\u2019s director, plans were already underway to hold a physical Merdeka-themed exhibition in the months leading up to August.\n\nHowever, with the extension of MCO 3.0, it became painfully clear that Plan B would have to be executed.\n\n\u201cDue to the pandemic and the increasing number of cases, I decided to launch an online show with an e-catalogue instead,\u201d he said.\n\nThat way, art enthusiasts will still be able to view the art pieces themselves without leaving the safety of their homes.\n\n\u201cMost of these artists\u2019 works exhibited in the \u2018Jalur Gemilang\u2019 exhibition are based on our national flag\u2019s colours,\u201d Ng said, adding that a majority of them used copious amounts of red, yellow, blue and white in multiple art styles including abstract, still-life and figurative.\n\nAccording to him, the artists are a fascinating group made up of graduates fresh out of art school as well as senior artists who have made a name for themselves in the art world.\n\nFMT had the pleasure of interviewing six of the artists regarding their hopes for the country this Merdeka month.\n\nYuki Lim Xiao Mun, artist of the almost ethereal \u201cThe Paradise Land\u201d, had this to say: \u201cMy hope for this Merdeka month is that our country can be restored to good condition after the economic hardship caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nShe said it was also her sincere hope that Malaysia\u2019s leaders will lead the country down the right path by practising integrity in their leadership.\n\nLikewise, Fadzril Fakaruddin encouraged Malaysians to stay united no matter what the circumstances, so that together, they could be free of Covid-19 for good.\n\nWhile Hamir Soib hopes for better governance, fellow artist Najib Ahmad Bamadhaj is hopeful for a return to normalcy and the good \u2018ol pre-Covid days.\n\nNational unity is something that veteran artist, Awang Damit, believes is vital if the country is to survive these difficult times.\n\nAnd another artist, Zulkefli Talha, reminded Malaysians to love each other as fellow countrymen regardless of racial or religious differences.\n\n\u201cLeaders have to be good examples for the people. And both leaders and the people have to work together to end this pandemic and return Malaysia to its former glory.\u201d\n\nNg told FMT that the pandemic had been especially tough on many artists. The numerous lockdowns this past year and a half meant potential buyers were unable to view the artworks personally and as a consequence, there was little to no sales.\n\nHe said there was an urgent need for artists to find alternative avenues to display their work so that they could continue to earn a decent living.\n\nNg explained that things have not been looking up for artists for a while now. Prior to the pandemic, the sluggish economy meant artists struggled to make a sale. The lockdowns brought about by the pandemic, only made things worse.\n\n\u201cMost collectors and buyers prefer to see the pieces in person. There\u2019s a huge difference between seeing artworks personally and virtually,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen you view an artwork physically, you will be able to see the texture, notice the colour tones and spot the little details. That\u2019s something these virtual exhibitions sadly cannot offer.\u201d\n\nHowever, this has not dampened the spirit of art collectors such as Brendan Siva in regard to the \u201cJalur Gemilang\u201d exhibition.\n\n\u201cEach piece is unique as an individual interpretation and expression of what Malaysia represents and symbolises in the eyes of the artist.

So it\u2019s just like dance.\u201d\n\nEach scene will be discussed and rehearsed beforehand, away from the glare of the dozens of people usually present on a set.\n\n\u201cWhen the camera rolls or they\u2019re up on stage, they know they can perform that intimate contact, knowing where they\u2019re going to be touched,\u201d she says.\n\nAt the heart of her philosophy is consent, in an industry which has been rocked in recent years by sexual assault claims. Her motto, which she says she often repeats to actors, is: \u201cYour \u2018no\u2019 is a gift. Tell us your \u2018no\u2019, so that we can trust your \u2018yes'\u201d.\n\n\u2018Incredibly hard\u2019\n\nO\u2019Brien was a dancer in the theatre for 10 years and then an actress for eight before she sensed an opportunity and became an intimacy coordinator in 2014.\n\nIt was a pioneering move at a time when actors\u2019 consent was little talked about, and before the #MeToo movement against sexual abuse and sexual harassment.\n\nBefore then, \u201cif an actor ever said \u2018no\u2019, they\u2019d be a troublemaker or a diva, and they would certainly be worried about losing their job,\u201d she recalls.\n\nIn such an environment, she describes her early days in the role as \u201cincredibly hard\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had productions where I\u2019ve been told not to speak to the director,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m serving the director\u2019s vision, but the director doesn\u2019t want to speak to me because he\u2019s a 74-year-old man, who basically doesn\u2019t want to acknowledge my existence.\u201d\n\nOn other occasions, she was not allowed on the set because the actors or director did not want her help.\n\nAttitudes have since changed a lot. The profession is becoming more popular and O\u2019Brien is in high demand, especially after Michaela Coel dedicated her best actress BAFTA win this year for \u201cI May Destroy You\u201d to her.\n\n\u201cThank you, Ita, for making a space safe, for creating physical, emotional and professional boundaries, so we can make work about exploitation, loss of respect, about abuse of powers, without being exploited or abused in the process,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["stars", "sexual", "ita", "obrien", "indemand", "intimacy", "process", "coordinator", "scenes", "sex", "actor",

Covid jabs per day and are moving towards increasing to 20,000 doses per day. \u2014 Picture by Sayuti Zainudin\n\nFollow us on Instagram and subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates.\n\nGEORGE TOWN, Aug 1 \u2014 Factories and small businesses in Penang, especially those hard hit by disruptions due to the Covid-19 pandemic, are looking forward to resuming operations as soon as possible even if it means making vaccination mandatory for their workers.\n\nAs there are currently no laws to enforce mandatory Covid-19 vaccination on workers, some companies are taking steps to get their workers to register for vaccination.\n\nPenang Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM) chairman Datuk Jimmy Ong said most factories here are encouraging their workers to register for their Covid jabs through various methods.\n\n\u201cSome companies are giving paid leave to their workers to go for vaccination and some are even offering monetary rewards,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the main reason multinational companies (MNC) are setting up Program Imunisasi Industri Covid-19 Kerjasama Awam-Swasta (Pikas) vaccination centres within their own factory grounds is to encourage their workers to get vaccinated.\n\nHe said the Pikas PPVs in Penang are now dispensing 15,000 doses per day and are moving towards increasing to 20,000 doses per day.\n\nHe said the vaccination of workers in MNCs is progressing very fast due to the on-site PPVs for larger factories which employ thousands of workers.\n\n\u201cIt is slower for small medium enterprises as they can only send their workers to the Pikas PPVs and there are only two of those now; one in Jawi and one at Equatorial Hotel,\u201d he said.\n\nEven with vaccination in full force, Ong said some of the companies in the manufacturing sector have continued to conduct screening of workers every two to three weeks.\n\n\u201cScreening still has to continue to control any potential spread of cases within the factories because we know, even those vaccinated still have a risk of contracting Covid-19,\u201d he said.\n\nFMM Penang branch offers a Penang SAFE programme for factories to conduct screening tests for its workers at a lower rate of RM60 per person.\n\nOng said the programme recommends that any company taking up the package conduct screening of 100 per cent of its staff in the first round.\n\n\u201cAfter that, they can conduct screening on 20 per cent of their staff for the second round and another 20 per cent on the third round, and so on,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, one of the SMEs in Penang, Chemdyes Sdn Bhd, has checked labour laws on ways to compel its employees to get vaccinated.\n\nThe company\u2019s managing director Joe Sidek said it was informed that there are at present no laws for the company to compel its employees to register for vaccination.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t legally force them to register for vaccination, it is a personal right, so what we do is to encourage them to do it as a way to safeguard everyone\u2019s safety in the workplace,\u201d he said.\n\nThe factory, specialising in textile chemicals, has about 22 workers and Joe said all have registered for vaccination.\n\nA nurse administers a dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at the Pikas vaccination centre at the Bukit Jawi Golf Resort in Penang June 17, 2021. \u2014 Picture by Sayuti Zainudin\n\nHe said despite the downturn in the textile industry due to the pandemic, Chemdyes recorded stable revenue last year and expects an increase in revenue this year.\n\n\u201cWe have kept all our staff and did not cut any pay so we have been very fortunate and we want to ensure that everyone is safe, we do not want to have any cases that could disrupt production,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said he would allow his workers to stay home for a week and to undergo screening tests if they have been exposed to places with a high number of Covid-19 cases.\n\nMeanwhile, it was reported that the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) is considering making vaccination of all employees in the retail sector one of the pre-conditions for approval for companies to resume operation, during the National Recovery Plan (NRP) period.\n\nYin\u2019s Sourdough Bakery and cafe co-founder Ong Seng Keat has already made it compulsory for all of its 40 workers to sign up for vaccination.\n\n\u201cWe will check our workers\u2019 MySejahtera to make sure they have registered and if we have to pay for it, we will,\u201d he said.\n\nHis company has already paid for all of his workers in Klang Valley to be vaccinated under a retail industry vaccination programme.\n\nHe hopes such programmes will be available in Penang so he can send all his workers to be vaccinated as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cThe government really needs to speed up its vaccination programme for the economic frontliners because we deal with people every day,\u201d he said.\n\nMugshot Cafe co-founder Jesse Tan agrees with Ong that vaccination for economic frontliners should be sped up.\n\n\u201cSo far, all of our staff have registered for vaccination but they are still waiting for their appointments,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of Mugshot\u2019s staff contracted Covid-19 a few months back due to close contact with a relative but fortunately, it did not spread to the other staff in the cafe.\n\n\u201cThere are 15 of us in the cafe and all of us went for screening the moment we found out he was positive but luckily, we were all negative,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the incident further emphasises the importance of vaccination for all workers who deal with customers daily.\n\nAs for Hin Bus Depot manager Tan Shih Thoe, he is also considering only allowing fully vaccinated vendors to participate in the Hin Bus Depot weekly bazaar, when they are finally allowed to reopen.\n\n\u201cI was just thinking about this, especially for the market, whether I should only allow vendors who are fully vaccinated to participate... main consideration is their safety since the market is considered a crowded space,\u201d he said.\n\nThere used to be 70 vendors at the weekly market before the pandemic but due to standard operating procedures (SOPs), the number of vendors came down to around 55 each week.\n\nThe market has been closed for more than two months due to the movement control order (MCO) and subsequent phases of the NRP.\n\nHin Bus Depot has around 15 tenants, consisting of eateries and artisans, and Tan said he will also strongly encourage the tenants and their workers to register for vaccination.\n\n\u201cMost of them are in favour of vaccination as they see it as the only solution to things getting back to normal,\u201d he said.\n\nFurry Kids pet shop owner Dalbinder Singh also agrees that it is important for those in the retail sector to be vaccinated.\n\n\u201cWe are meeting people and customers daily so it is important for the safety of everyone,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, he said it would be infringing on the individual\u2019s human rights to force workers to register for vaccination so he can only encourage them to do so.\n\n\u201cFortunately, all of my staff have registered but they are still waiting... I am also still waiting for my appointment,\u201d he said.\n\nHe too said vaccination for retail workers should be sped up since they face customers daily.", "keyword": ["register", "vaccination", "manufacturing", "ong", "pikas", "workers", "services", "support", "staff", "sectors", "employers", "screening", "mandate", "covid19", "vaccinated", "penang", "vaccine"], "summary": "As there are currently no laws to enforce mandatory Covid-19 vaccination on workers, some companies are taking steps to get their workers to register for vaccination.\nPenang Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM) chairman Datuk Jimmy Ong said most factories here are encouraging their workers to register for their Covid jabs through various methods.\nHe said the vaccination of workers in MNCs is progressing very fast due to the on-site PPVs for larger factories which employ thousands of workers.\nFMM Penang branch offers a Penang SAFE programme for factories to conduct screening tests for its workers at a lower rate of RM60 per person.\nA nurse administers a dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at the Pikas vaccination centre at the Bukit Jawi Golf Resort in Penang June 17, 2021.", "news": "Malay Mail", "date": "2021-08-01 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Can employers make COVID-19 vaccinations mandatory for all staff?

Here\u2019s what you need to know:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Can employers make vaccination compulsory for employees?\n\nEmployment lawyer Donovan Cheah said there is no law now that disallows mandatory vaccination policies by employers, and that there are no known court cases in the country about whether such a policy would be legal.\n\n\u201cGiven the severity of the pandemic, having a mandatory vaccination policy is one of the ways for employers to safeguard the safety and health of their employees and curb the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cHowever, there are no reported court cases in Malaysia about the legality of mandatory vaccination policies, and whether an employer can take disciplinary action against an employee for refusing to vaccinate,\u201d he said, but noted there have been reported cases in countries like Australia and the US which upheld the dismissal of employees who refuse to comply with their employer\u2019s mandatory vaccination policy.\n\nSpecialist employment lawyer Marcus van Geyzel said employers would generally be able to make it compulsory for their employees to undergo COVID-19 vaccination if this is due to a government-imposed requirement.\n\n\u201cYes, if the MDTCA/KPDNHEP makes employee vaccinations mandatory or a pre-condition for approval to operate, the affected employers can impose this requirement on employees,\u201d he told Malay Mail.\n\n\u201cHowever, employers should be cautious where there are special circumstances, such as where an employee is unable to receive a vaccination due to a medical condition,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIn general, it would be very unlikely for an employee to successfully challenge an employer\u2019s mandatory vaccination policy where vaccinations have been declared a pre-condition for operations by the government.\n\nIn order to bring a successful legal action, an employee would have to show that in mandating vaccination, the employer has exercised its managerial power in a non-genuine manner, or that there was victimisation or an unfair labour practice,\u201d he said.\n\n2. What if the employees say no to vaccination?\n\nCheah said employers can choose to take disciplinary action against employees who refuse vaccination, and that whether such action is reasonable depends on the situation.\n\n\u201cWhile an employer cannot physically compel an employee to take the vaccine, an employee\u2019s freedom of choice is not the same thing as freedom from consequences. There are no legal prohibitions against an employer implementing a mandatory vaccination policy, although how employers deal with breaches of this policy may be evaluated by the courts,\u201d he said.\n\nCheah said disciplinary action including dismissal may be seen as reasonable, taking into account various factors.\n\nHe listed examples such as the employee\u2019s reason for refusal; whether the employee\u2019s refusal amounts to a breach of their duties or has caused loss or damage to the company or other employees; whether the employee\u2019s job function requires him/her to have regular and frequent physical interaction with third parties.\n\nOther factors listed by Cheah are the current severity of the pandemic; whether the employer\u2019s business deals with high-risk individuals; and whether vaccination is a pre-condition from the authorities for the employer to operate.\n\n\u201cWhere an employee has a legitimate reason to refuse vaccination (eg: health condition), employers should explore other ways to address the risk, such as requiring them to carry out their duties remotely and not allowing them to enter the premises without notice,\u201d Cheah added.\n\nVan Geyzel said employers would have several options, when vaccinations are a precondition for operations but there are employees who refuse to get vaccinated.\n\nThese options are to engage with the employees, or to transfer employees to alternative roles, or to ultimately stop employing the employee.\n\n\u201cThe first step should always be for employers to have clear and open conversations with these employees to ensure that they understand the reason for the vaccination requirement.\n\n\u201cEmployers can also consider redesignating or redeploying the affected employees to other roles within the business which are not customer-facing and which may be exempted from the regulatory requirements,\u201d he said.\n\nIf redesignation and redeployment is not an option, employers would be legally able to terminate the employee\u2019s employment if it is reasonable in the circumstances, he said.\n\nVan Geyzel said there is a general legal expectation that an employee has to follow all lawful and reasonable instructions by the employer.\n\nHe added that it can be argued that an employee is carrying out an act of insubordination by refusing to be vaccinated under the circumstances, as the employee is wilfully disobeying a lawful and reasonable order issued by the employer.\n\n\u201cAny punishment or action by the employer in response to insubordination has to be reasonable or proportionate, and it can be said here that where the result of the employee\u2019s vaccination is that the business would not be allowed to operate, there are serious repercussions and therefore termination of employment is a reasonable response by the employer.\n\n\u201cAnother potential justification for termination of employment is that an unvaccinated employee would be unable to perform the job or service for which the employee was employed. This would be the case if an unvaccinated employee is not permitted by law to work.\n\n\u201cIn such a situation, it may be reasonable for an employer to deem that the employment contract cannot be performed and therefore can be terminated,\u201d he said.\n\n3. What if an employee says no to vaccination due to health conditions?\n\nAs for employees who are unable to receive COVID-19 vaccinations due to a medical condition, van Geyzel said employers could explore measures such as redesignation.\n\n\u201cFirstly, I don\u2019t think the government would make vaccinations mandatory for such employees.\n\n\u201cSecondly, even if the government issued a blanket requirement, the employer should see if it\u2019s possible to apply for an exemption for that employee, or again see if redeployment or redesignation is an option.\n\n\u201cTermination should always be a last resort, but if the employer has acted reasonably, then termination should be possible under the law,\u201d he said, also saying that an employee would be unlikely to succeed in an unfair dismissal claim if an employer treated the employee fairly and could show that the termination was reasonable in the circumstances.\n\nFor employees with pre-existing health conditions that prevent them from being vaccinated, employment lawyer Jayasingam Poopalasingam said employers can seek to take mitigation measures such as changing their work roles or have them work remotely.\n\nHowever, if the nature of the business and nature of the employee\u2019s work requires vaccination, but vaccination is not possible due to the health condition and mitigating measures are not feasible through no fault of both the employer or the employee, the employer may be left with no choice but to terminate employment.\n\nThe employee could under such circumstances file a complaint to claim that the dismissal was without just cause and excuse, but it would ultimately be for the Industrial Court to decide if the dismissal was with just cause and excuse, he said.\n\n4. Putting it into the employment contract and putting it in writing\n\nJayasingam, who is also co-chair of the Bar Council\u2019s Industrial and Employment Law Committee, similarly said there are currently no laws that mandate COVID-19 vaccination for employees.\n\nThis means that for existing employees, an employer cannot \u201cforce\u201d them to be vaccinated, but can only seek to persuade and convince the employee of the need to be vaccinated due to reasons such as the nature of the work.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing much you can do, you cannot force the employee to go for vaccination, you cannot force an employee to undergo a medical procedure, it has to be by way of consent,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf they are existing employees, it must be by way of consent. They have a right to refuse vaccination, that\u2019s why we advise employers to obtain the written consent of employees to be vaccinated,\u201d he said, explaining that a mere verbal consent is not advisable as an employee could later claim to have never given consent.\n\nFor employees who pose a high risk due to the nature of their job as a frontliner or being in contact with others but refuse vaccination, employers can transfer them to another position where they do not deal with customers or other employees, he said.\n\nBut for new employees, an employer can make being vaccinated against COVID-19 a part of the employment contract prior to them joining the company, he said.\n\n\u201cYou cannot force it but what you can do is if you are having new employees, you can put it as a term of the contract, where they must be vaccinated before they are hired for employment, or they must undertake they will be vaccinated after they join you,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the new recruit would have the option of not joining the company upon viewing the contract, while employers can terminate employment if the new hire subsequently does not comply with instructions to be vaccinated as promised under the contract.\n\n5. About legal action\n\nIf an employer forces an employee to undergo COVID-19 vaccination, the employee can possibly walk out of the job and try to claim \u201cconstructive dismissal\u201d, Jayasingam said.\n\nIn cases of constructive dismissal claims, the employer does not have to issue a letter of termination, but the employee is essentially claiming that the employer has done something in breach of his contractual rights and that the employer\u2019s conduct had resulted in the employee\u2019s resignation.\n\nSuch an employee could then seek to prove their case in the Industrial Court to claim for monetary compensation and reinstatement to the job with all previous benefits and rights unaffected, including the right to not be forced to be vaccinated, Jayasingam said. It would ultimately be for the Industrial Court to decide if there was constructive dismissal.\n\nAlternatively, employees can also file a claim in civil courts but this is usually not preferred as the compensation is very small, with most employees likely to go to the Industrial Court instead, he said.\n\nUnlike new employees who have agreed to being vaccinated under the employment contract and can be terminated for non-compliance, Jayasingam said employers could face labour complaints by existing employees if the latter are terminated over their non-vaccinated status.\n\n\u201cIf the employer terminates them for not being vaccinated, the employee can file a complaint of dismissal without just cause and excuse,\u201d he said, explaining the process as involving employees filing complaints with the Industrial Relations Department under the Human Resources Ministry within 60 days of dismissal to see whether it could be resolved amicably, with the matter to be referred by the department director-general to the Industrial Court if it cannot be resolved.\n\nBut in situations where it is a government requirement for staff to be vaccinated in order to operate, an employer may have reason to terminate an employee who refuses to get vaccinated if it affects the business, Jayasingam said.\n\n\u201cSo the employer may have just cause and excuse to terminate the employee because he cannot carry on business,\u201d he said.\n\nJayasingam gave a hypothetical example, where an employee who works as a carer at a nursing home refuses to be vaccinated when it is a government requirement for such work, and the carer may as a result pose a risk to the elderly persons at the nursing home.\n\nIn such a situation and where there are no mitigation measures possible, the employer \u2014 who is unable to force the employee to be vaccinated \u2014 may opt to terminate the employee as it affects the business or may result in the nursing home having to be closed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s for the Industrial Court to decide whether what the employer did was reasonable or not,\u201d he said.\n\n6. Can the government make COVID-19 vaccination mandatory for employees?\n\nVan Geyzel said there may be a stronger basis for a compulsory vaccination requirement by the government for certain industries.\n\n\u201cThe laws that have been passed in response to the pandemic grant the government very broad powers to impose SOPs or pre-conditions for businesses to operate, and when it comes to roles or industries that have clear and frequent face-to-face contact and interaction with the general public, there is a stronger justification for the authorities to impose mandatory vaccination requirements. This is especially so as vaccinations are widely available and accessible.\n\n\u201cHowever, if the government overreaches and tries to impose mandatory vaccinations on other roles or industries where there is no clear face-to-face interaction or risk, I could see this being open to legal challenge,\u201d he said.\n\nJayasingam said the government could impose mandatory vaccinations on the general population including employees by passing an Act in Parliament, but believes that implementing such a policy of forcing vaccinations would only be a \u201clast resort.\u201d \u2014 Malay Mail", "keyword": ["vaccination", "employee", "employer", "say", "staff", "heres", "employers", "lawyers", "employees", "employment", "mandatory", "covid19", "vaccinated", "reasonable", "vaccinations"], "summary": "\u201cYes, if the MDTCA/KPDNHEP makes employee vaccinations mandatory or a pre-condition for approval to operate, the affected employers can impose this requirement on employees,\u201d he told Malay Mail.\n\u201cIn general, it would be very unlikely for an employee to successfully challenge an employer\u2019s mandatory vaccination policy where vaccinations have been declared a pre-condition for operations by the government.\n\u201cFirstly, I don\u2019t think the government would make vaccinations mandatory for such employees.\nCan the government make COVID-19 vaccination mandatory for employees?\n\u201cHowever, if the government overreaches and tries to impose mandatory vaccinations on other roles or industries where there is no clear face-to-face interaction or risk, I could see this being open to legal challenge,\u201d he said.", "news": "SoyaCincau.com", "date": "2021-08-02 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Ministry mulls proposal to control price of Covid-19 test kit", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbGF5bWFpbC5jb20vbmV3cy9tYWxheXNpYS8yMDIxLzA4LzAzL21pbmlzdHJ5LW11bGxzLXByb3Bvc2FsLXRvLWNvbnRyb2wtcHJpY2Utb2YtY292aWQtMTktdGVzdC1raXQvMTk5NDkwMtIBfGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbGF5bWFpbC5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wOC8wMy9taW5pc3RyeS1tdWxscy1wcm9wb3NhbC10by1jb250cm9sLXByaWNlLW9mLWNvdmlkLTE5LXRlc3Qta2l0LzE5OTQ5MDI?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://media2.malaymail.com/resize_cache/uploads/articles/2021/2021-07/covid_test_kit2_26072021-seo.jpg", "text": "Deputy Minister Datuk Rosol Wahid said based on feedback from the public, the test kit price is a burden especially to the low-income groups and families with many children. \u2014 Bernama pic\n\nFollow us on Instagram and subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates.\n\nKUALA BERANG, Aug 3 \u2015 The Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) is considering a proposal to control the price of the Covid-19 test kit, said Deputy Minister Datuk Rosol Wahid.\n\nHe said based on feedback from the public, the test kit price is a burden especially to the low-income groups and families with many children.\n\n\u201cWe were told that the price is RM39.90 each, not many can afford to buy it at that price.

Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on household income and made more people poorer, according to a study conducted by the Department of Statistics.\n\nThe Covid-19 impact study on household income in Malaysia for 2020 revealed that the number of poor households increased to 639,800 in 2020, up from 405,400 in 2019.\n\nThe findings of the study are contained in the Household Income Estimates and Incidence of Poverty Report, Malaysia, 2020 which the department released today.\n\nChief Statistician Datuk Seri Dr Mohd Uzir Mahidin said in a statement that the incidence of absolute poverty also increased, from 5.6 per cent in 2019 to 8.4 per cent in 2020, and that the incidence of hardcore poverty is estimated to increase from 0.4 per cent (2019) involving 27,200 households to 1.0 per cent involving 78,000 households.\n\nHe said the pandemic had also affected the structure of household groups, with 20 per cent of households from the M40 group with income between RM4,850 and RM10,959 having moved to the B40 group.\n\n\u201cHouseholds in the T20 group were also affected by the Covid-19 pandemic where 12.8 per cent of this group has shifted to the M40 group,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also said that as the percentage decrease in income for B40 and M40 households was larger than the T20 households group, the income distribution for B40 and M40 declined to 15.9 per cent (2019: 16.0 per cent) and 36.9 per cent (2019: 37.2 per cent), respectively.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the T20 group owned 47.2 per cent of income increased by 0.4 percentage points from 2019,\u201d he added.\n\nMohd Uzir said the mean of monthly household gross income decreased by negative 10.3 per cent to record RM7,089 as compared to RM7,901 in 2019 and added that the decline was contributed by households or individuals who experienced loss or reduction of income, particularly those with the status of employee, self-employed and others.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, this reduction of income was not only caused by job loss but also contributed by the reduction of working hours and increase in skill-related underemployment,\u201d he said.\n\nMohd Uzir said that all territories/states recorded a decline in mean and median of monthly household gross income. The Federal Territory of Putrajaya registered the lowest reduction in monthly household income and remained to record the highest mean and median of monthly household gross income as compared to other territories/states with RM12,322 and RM9,743, respectively.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, Kelantan remained to record the lowest mean and median income with RM4,411 and RM3,010, respectively,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also said that the incidence of absolute poverty by state shows that Sabah recorded the highest percentage of 25.3 per cent (2019: 19.5 per cent) while Kelantan recorded a significant increase in poverty by 8.8 percentage points to 21.2 per cent from 12.4 per cent (2019), followed by Terengganu by 5.9 percentage points to 12 per cent from 6.1 per cent (2019).\n\nMohd Uzir said the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic may be temporary as the economy is expected to improve and recover as the spread of the pandemic can be contained.\n\n\u201cFrom this analysis, it is found that the role of the federal and state governments as well as other relevant parties is pertinent in cushioning the impact of the pandemic as well as towards reviving the household income and the country\u2019s economy,\u201d he said.- Bernama", "keyword": ["study", "households", "poverty", "2019", "income", "household", "cent", "covid19", "uzir", "impact", "pandemic", "reveals", "percentage", "group", "significant"], "summary": "KUALA LUMPUR: The Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on household income and made more people poorer, according to a study conducted by the Department of Statistics.\nThe Covid-19 impact study on household income in Malaysia for 2020 revealed that the number of poor households increased to 639,800 in 2020, up from 405,400 in 2019.\nThe findings of the study are contained in the Household Income Estimates and Incidence of Poverty Report, Malaysia, 2020 which the department released today.\nMohd Uzir said that all territories/states recorded a decline in mean and median of monthly household gross income.\nThe Federal Territory of Putrajaya registered the lowest reduction in monthly household income and remained to record the highest mean and median of monthly household gross income as compared to other territories/states with RM12,322 and RM9,743, respectively.", "news": "The Sun Daily", "date": "2021-08-06 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Not so slick: Domestic Trade Ministry foils attempt to misappropriate 18,000kg of cooking oil", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEEHgxPt-i917aEqtS9q5XVIqGQgEKhAIACoHCAow-N7eCjC60NYBMLfbhwM?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Santhakumar A L"], "top-image": "https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2021/08/11/1252988.jpg", "text": "SHAH ALAM (Bernama): The Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry has foiled an attempt to misappropriate 18,000kg of cooking oil, 8,775 kg of which were subsidised 1kg packets.\n\nThe ministry's Selangor director Muhammad Zikril Azan Abdullah said raids carried out on two stores in Puchong found that the embezzlement activity was done by cutting the 1kg packets of subsidised cooking oil and transferring them to a skid tank to be bottled as 2kg and 5kg and sold for higher prices.\n\nHe said four locals and a foreigner, suspected to be an Indonesian, between the age of 30 and 50, identified as the owners of the premises were arrested to assist in the investigation.\n\nHe added that two lorries, a skid tank, forklift, cut 1kg plastic packets and bottles of cooking oil used to make the transfer were confiscated.

earnings in the second half of the financial year 2021 (2H21), underpinned by higher exports volume and refining margins.\n\nCGS-CIMB Securities Sdn Bhd analysts Nagulan Ravi and Ivy Ng Lee Fang, in a research report, stated that MSM have rightly hedged 99% of its financial year 2021 forecast (FY21F) domestic wholesale raw sugar requirement at US$0.13 (RM0.55) to US$0.14 per pounds (lbs) and 43% of its FY22F requirement at US$0.15-0.16/lbs.\n\nLast year\u2019s raw sugar price averaged at US$0.13-0.14/lbs.\n\n\u201cThis bodes well for MSM given raw sugar prices have been trending higher over the past 18 months to US$0.185/lbs currently, due to supply disruptions in Brazil and Thailand,\u201d the analysts stated in the report yesterday, following a recent update from the company\u2019s management.\n\nThe analysts stated that MSM expects a 10% year-on-year (YoY) growth in its domestic sales volumes in FY21F and has raised its average selling prices (ASPs) for both the wholesale (up to the maximum ceiling price of RM2.69 per kg) and industry segments.\n\nThe higher ASPs and sales volumes would help boost MSM\u2019s domestic refining margins in 2H21F, they added.\n\nRavi and Ng further stated that MSM had secured export contracts worth 65% to 70% of its original 300,000MT export sales target for FY21F.\n\n\u201cThe group is now optimistic of delivering close to 350,000MT of export sales in FY21F, in line with our forecast of 340,000MT, which is a 25% YoY growth versus FY20,\u201d Ravi and Ng added.\n\nThey said the higher export volumes would be driven by stronger demand from its largest export destination, Vietnam, which accounts for around 50% of its exports, and other countries that have reopened from Covid-19 restrictions.\n\nIncreased demand for its value-added products such as liquid sugar, fine syrup and premix products could increase volumes.\n\nThe analysts viewed exports growth would lower refining costs at the group\u2019s refinery in Johor.\n\n\u201cPost the optimisation of its Johor refinery, MSM expects to achieve a 50% utilisation factor (UF) for its Johor refinery in 2H21.\n\n\u201cWe project the Johor refinery could return to the black in FY22F as we project a 52% UF for the year, driven by higher exports volumes,\u201d Ravi and Ng added.\n\nCGS-CIMB forecast MSM to deliver Ebitda margins of 10.9% to 12.4% in FY21-23F, led by higher domestic and export margins and more robust export volumes.\n\n\u201cWe raise our FY21-23F earnings per share forecast by 1.5% to 6.9% to reflect lower refining costs and higher export premiums.\n\n\u201cIn light of this, we raise our target price (TP) to RM1.69 based on a price/net tangible asset (P/ NTA) of 1.2 times (one standard deviation below MSM\u2019s 10-year average P/NTA) versus one time previously,\u201d the analysts wrote.\n\nThe brokerage firm also upgraded MSM to \u2018Add\u2019 as the stock offers a 25% upside to its TP and attractive dividend yields of 6.1% to 7.5% in FY21-23F.\n\nFurther key catalysts include potential equity placements to collaborative partners and the completion of the sale of MSM Perlis, which will allow the MSM group to book a one-off

integrated nature of the Asean\u2019s supply chain, the impact from Vietnam\u2019s Covid-19 woes which culminated in the extension of lockdown measures under the government\u2019s Directive 16 in various provinces in the south are felt by Malaysian businesses that have a presence there.\n\nThe directive stipulates the closure of non-essential businesses, ban on public gatherings and severely limited transport services, in an attempt to contain the wave of Covid Delta variant infections.\n\nIn the past, Vietnam enjoyed success in containing the pandemic attributed to prompt border closure and lockdown measures, as well as an extensive testing and contact tracing strategy.\n\nVietnam recorded 8,324 new Covid-19 cases on Friday, according to the country\u2019s Ministry of Health. The new infections brought the total tally to 193,381, with 3,016 deaths, the ministry said.\n\nCurrently, 19 southern localities in the country, including Ho Chi Minh City, have implemented a lockdown via Directive 16 until Aug 16.

It is assessing the impact of the closure on its financial performance and announcements will be made if there is any material development.\n\nPoh Huat Resources Holdings Bhd\n\nThe group\u2019s subsidiary, Poh Huat Furniture Industries Vietnam Joint Stock Co, which has factories in Binh Duong Province and Dong Nai Province, has halted production activities in line with the lockdown order. As of July 21, it said none of its employees in the two locations has exhibited any Covid-19 symptoms and it will undertake screening and quarantine measures should any employee exhibit symptoms or be confirmed positive of the virus.\n\nConsequently, the production interruption is expected to cause delay in the shipment of orders to its customers in the US. Poh Huat\u2019s management is in discussions with affected customers to reschedule their delivery dates for affected orders.

These criteria must be publicised so that any future decisions will be solely based on evidence,\u201d MHC explained.\n\nAdditionally, the coalition said the government should clarify the specifics of these relaxed restrictions, because blanket vaccine privileges will create loopholes that will impede NRP.\n\n\u201cFor example, the government must answer questions like: What is the rationale to allow home quarantine for vaccinated travellers, how long is the quarantine and how will we monitor? How do we close the loopholes that may allow \u2018inter-state vacations on the pretext of visiting our children?\u2019\u201d it said.\n\nMeanwhile, Malaysian Medical Association (MMA) president Datuk Dr Subramaniam Muniandy said the decision to relax restrictions must be supported with sufficient scientific evidence.\n\n\u201cIf it is indeed a decision based on science, why then is travel allowed for those wishing to see their spouse or their young children? Either it\u2019s sufficiently safe for the fully vaccinated to travel, in which case all vaccinated individuals should be allowed to do so, or it is not, in which nobody should travel,\u201d he said.\n\nHe noted that some of those states in Phase 2 are showing an increasing trend in Covid-19 cases.\n\n\u201cThe government should stop its hyping up on the total number of cases. What is important are hospital bed utilisation and the intensive care units (ICUs) situation in the country,\u201d Dr Subramaniam said.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, we hope that the government will provide an update on the positivity rate and the status of bed utilisation and ICUs in each state as these will be more meaningful indicators apart from the daily new cases. It is important that the public be kept informed of the bed capacity and ICUs status in their respective state,\u201d he added.\n\nMMA also said that the lifting of restrictions must also take into

skin and hair.\n\nETX Daily Up is focussing on a few that should help convince you to either concoct your own treatments, or embrace some of the numerous cosmetic formulations based on this precious ingredient.\n\nCaffeine, an active ingredient that shouldn\u2019t be ignored\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon to find cosmetics formulated with caffeine, an active ingredient known for its slimming and firming benefits.\n\nGenerally, it is found in creams, gels, and other beauty products designed to help lose a few centimetres on the hips, thighs, or buttocks, as well as in anti-cellulite products or formulations designed to help users improve toning or firmness.\n\nBut caffeine is also present in certain facial care products, again with the aim of fighting skin slackening, but also \u2013 and above all \u2013 to improve the appearance of the eye contour area and reduce puffiness and dark circles (it can be even more effective if the product has spent some time in the refrigerator).\n\nCreams, gels, masks, cleansers: caffeine is nowadays found in products at all price points in the cosmetic departments of department stores and specialised shops.\n\nIn the form of powder and grounds\n\nWith the advent of DIY beauty, coffee now shows up in many so-called \u201chomemade\u201d recipes in the form of powder or grounds.\n\nRich in caffeine, these formulations can offer the advantages mentioned above, but are also powerful antioxidants, which allows them to fight against certain effects seen on mature skins, and more generally against skin aging.\n\nIn addition to these inherent virtues, coffee grounds, thanks to their specific texture, also make for a great exfoliant for sloughing off dead cells.\n\nAll you need to do is mix it with other ingredients: egg white for a mask, vegetable oil and honey for a face and body scrub, or even on its own to exfoliate scalp and hair to make it shinier.\n\nOver on TikTok, known for being the go-to social network for DIY beauty recipes, one can also discover a multitude of recipes for masks and scrubs made from soluble coffee or coffee beans.\n\nRecipes that users seem to have not only tested but also

collaborating with GE Digital on aircraft fuel efficiency monitoring solutions as part of the carrier\u2019s initiatives to meet its sustainability goals.\n\nThe national flag carrier adopted GE Digital\u2019s Fuel Insight and FlightPulse aviation software to transform and modernise the airline\u2019s fuel efficiency programme.\n\nMAB has implemented various initiatives including efficiency measures, investments in sustainability solutions and waste reduction across its operations to address its sustainability goals.\n\nThe fuel efficiency programme has been running for over a decade, contributing to a 15% fuel burn improvement recorded over the past eight years.\n\nMAB\u2019s group operations officer, Ahmad Luqman Mohd Azmi, stated promoting sustainability in all of the MAB\u2019s operations has always been a top priority.\n\nHe said digitalisation is a core component of the airlines\u2019 long term business plan and such efforts bring immediate value especially in the area of fuel efficiency.\n\n\u201cWe are looking forward to such a partnership that contributes to the airline\u2019s efforts to accelerate our sustainability target.\n\n\u201cThrough these solutions, we seek to play a greater part in building a legacy for future generations and enhancing our own airline\u2019s sustainability efforts,\u201d Ahmad Luqman said in a statement yesterday.\n\nFuel Insight is a cost and emissions monitoring solution that works by understanding data from the aircraft to uncover valuable intelligence that helps increase fuel efficiency and reduce waste.\n\nIt also gives operators actionable intelligence at multiple levels allowing analysts to drill down macro trends to understand issues on a per-flight level.\n\nThe software uses GE Digital\u2019s Event Measurement System (EMS) aviation data and analytics platform to merge flight data with flight plans, load sheets and fuel uplift data, identify the most attainable fuel savings opportunities, and track the incremental savings across the operation.\n\nFlightPulse, meanwhile, puts data directly into the hands of pilots, allowing them to visualise their savings over time.\n\nPilots who understand their own performance can adjust their flight plans to maximise safety and fuel efficiency.\n\nSecure benchmarking and data sharing allows crew members to see their contribution to projects and dramatically shortens the feedback loop.\n\nMAB evaluated the software with an extensive team of pilots, dispatchers and analysts who endorsed the software solution, which is hosted on GE Digital\u2019s EMS platform.\n\nEMS is built on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform providing compute, data, and security services.\n\nGE Digital\u2019s GM of the aviation software business Andrew Coleman said the company is committed to environmental excellence and that includes ensuring its customers are empowered to reduce the impact of their technology and environmental footprint within their operations.\n\n\u201cThese solutions will help MAB to leverage software to improve efficiency and reduce carbon emissions,\u201d Coleman added.\n\nThe solution will be implemented by the GE Digital aviation software teams in Austin, Texas and Shanghai, China.\n\nAdditionally, GE Digital provides MAB with the tools to build its big data analytics and leverage modern tools for data analysis

But fans in Malaysia have something to look forward to as two locals are working on a real-life version of the game \u2013 and this time, you can finally taste your veggies.\n\nWith the help of artificial intelligence and, in the near future, drones, Aquaville Asia hopes to become the world\u2019s first aquaponics farm where subscribers can nurture actual crops through their phones.\n\nFeeling like kale this week but kangkung the next? No problem, just tap on your screen and come harvest day, you will be greeted at your doorstep with fresh greens harvested from your own aquaponic plot.\n\nThat\u2019s the plan, at least \u2013 but for the time being, the concept is already in motion where subscribers can get five packs of vegetables delivered four times a month, with optional tilapia fish.\n\nAquaville founder Chia Weng Yan tells FMT that the idea came to him in the middle of the night. \u201cI dreamt about it and jotted down \u2018FarmVille in real life\u2019,\u201d the 40-year-old says.\n\n\u201cI created a pitch deck for it thinking it was a great idea, but didn\u2019t execute it and kept it on my computer for a long time,\u201d he adds, explaining that he struggled to find someone with the technological know-how to make his literal dream a reality.\n\nThen, in July last year, Chia found the perfect person for the job.\n\nLoke Chung Eng had posted on Facebook about robotics and projects involving IOT, or \u201cinternet of things\u201d, a network of physical objects embedded with sensors, software and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data.\n\nA phone call later and Chia had joined forces with Loke, 33, to create Aquaville Asia. The duo worked for months on the concept.\n\nWhile Loke spent time programming the AI system, Chia reached out to urban farmers, friends and family members to get them on board.\n\nThe duo forged an alliance with AHA Services Malaysia, a farm run by urban agriculturalists who provide Aquaville with all their farming requirements, including maintenance, harvest and delivery of fresh produce to subscribers.\n\nChia and Loke leave the farming to these experts and do their share by equipping the farm with Aquaville\u2019s AI technology.\n\n\u201cWe provide them with smart-farm capabilities so if any subscriptions come in, they are ready to harvest and deliver the produce,\u201d Chia explains.\n\nHe adds that using AI, Loke created a way to spot diseases in crops using an NDVI camera that scans vegetables at different wavelengths \u201cso you know if they are dying ahead of time\u201d.\n\nThe AI system can even monitor pH levels, humidity, heat and water levels. All their crops are pesticide-free.\n\nAquaville was officially launched in January this year, and subscribers have been effusive about how lush and crisp their vegetables are, compared with those bought in a store.\n\nSome customers have also funnelled their harvests to the needy, among them three companies that donated to a special-needs home in Petaling Jaya \u2013 sending bundles of fresh greens to feed 74 children between January and June \u2013 as well as contributed towards the white flag movement.\n\nIn the near future, Chia and Loke aim to introduce an application and drone system that will swoop over crops and capture real-time footage. Subscribers will be able to monitor their greens and control them through the app.\n\nAdditionally, the duo hope to empower the less fortunate and provide deaf, mute and B40 families with job opportunities on the farm.\n\nIt may take a few years for this FarmVille dream to fully become a reality, but the Aquaville innovators are hopeful and looking forward to a bright and greener future.\n\nFor fresh produce at your door each week or to help the needy, contact Aquaville Asia via Facebook or check out their website.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["taste", "malaysias", "veggies", "provide", "ai", "loke", "crops", "system", "chia", "aquaville", "farmville", "subscribers", "fresh", "vegetables"], "summary": "PETALING JAYA: Thousands were left cropless and devastated last year when Zynga\u2019s popular game FarmVille announced the end of its 11-year legacy.\nBut fans in Malaysia have something to look forward to as two locals are working on a real-life version of the game \u2013 and this time, you can finally taste your veggies.\nAquaville founder Chia Weng Yan tells FMT that the idea came to him in the middle of the night.\nWhile Loke spent time programming the AI system, Chia reached out to urban farmers, friends and family members to get them on board.\nThe AI system can even monitor pH levels, humidity, heat and water levels.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-08-12 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "1989 Proton Black Knight Wins \u201cUnexceptional\u201d Award In UK Car Festival", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL2Z1bi8yMDIxLzA4LzAzLzE5ODktcHJvdG9uLWJsYWNrLWtuaWdodC13aW5zLXVuZXhjZXB0aW9uYWwtYXdhcmQtaW4tdWstY2FyLWZlc3RpdmFsL9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL2Z1bi8yMDIxLzA4LzAzLzE5ODktcHJvdG9uLWJsYWNrLWtuaWdodC13aW5zLXVuZXhjZXB0aW9uYWwtYXdhcmQtaW4tdWstY2FyLWZlc3RpdmFsL2FtcC8?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Azizul Rahman Ismail", "Maya Suraya"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Proton-Black-Knight.jpeg", "text": "Subscribe to our new Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates.\n\nThe Proton Saga is Malaysia\u2019s first car and was the symbol of the nation\u2019s success.

The colour of its bright and deep red seeds was the inspiration for the signature hue of the national car.\n\nHowever, the reality is, the name \u201cSaga\u201d was the winning entry in a competition held in 1984.\n\nThe winner, Staf Sarjan Ismail Jaafar said that the name is actually an acronym for Safety, Achievement, Greatness, and Ability.\n\nThey Don\u2019t Make Them Like They Used To\n\nThe first generation Saga had many iterations and was in production up to 1992.\n\nOne of its most notable versions of the Saga was a hatchback released in 1987 during the peak of popularity of a certain TV show starring a certain modified Pontiac Trans Am.\n\nThe hatchback was called the Proton Knight. It was later named Proton Saga Aeroback, perhaps for copyright reasons. But to be fair, the new name is more descriptive.\n\nAt the same time, the Proton Saga was also sold all over the world including the UK.\n\nIn fact, the UK even got versions of the Proton Saga that are not available in Malaysia.

This is the most likely scenario,\u201d said Le Parisien this morning.\n\n\u201cIt only seems to be a matter of hours,\u201d suggested sports daily L\u2019Equipe, which proclaimed \u201cwe are entering the most incredible days in the history of the French championship\u201d.\n\nBefore signing the contract in Paris, Messi will first have to undergo a medical examination.\n\nStressing no deals had been done, Messi conceded at his tearful farewell news conference in Barcelona yesterday that joining PSG was a \u201cpossibility\u201d.\n\nIn reality, they are the only club who can afford what is expected to be a deal worth \u20ac35 million a year for the 34-year-old Argentine.\n\n\u201cI gave everything for Barcelona from the first day that I arrived right to the last. I never imagined having to say goodbye,\u201d a tearful Messi told the news conference.\n\n\u201cI have still not come to terms with the reality of leaving this club now \u2013 I love this club.\u201d\n\nThis morning, the images of the Argentinian in tears leapt out from the pages of all the Spanish sports dailies such as Marca, AS and Sport.\n\nOne note of discord came from a group of Barcelona fans, represented by Parisian lawyer Juan Branco, who announced today their intention to lodge a complaint with the European Commission in connection with the rules of financial fair play that Barcelona and PSG must follow.\n\nThe group also intends to ask the French courts to suspend a possible transfer.\n\nMessi, widely considered the most gifted player in the history of the game, won 35 trophies at Barcelona after joining as a 13-year-old \u2013 including four Champions Leagues and 10 league titles while his 672 goals are a record tally for one club.\n\n\u2018Great for Ligue 1\u2019\n\nDespite offering to cut his salary by half to seal a new five-year deal which a club carrying debts of \u20ac1.2 billion and the player had agreed on, the agreement foundered on strict Spanish league salary restrictions.\n\nSome in France\u2019s Ligue 1 have mixed feelings about the impending arrival of Messi who will form a superstar attacking force alongside Kylian Mbappe and Neymar, who earns a reported \u20ac36 million a year and is a former Barcelona teammate of the Argentine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary for Ligue 1,\u201d said Metz coach Frederic Antonetti.\n\n\u201cBut for a purist like me, Messi should have finished his career at Barcelona.\u201d\n\nThis summer PSG have already added veteran Spanish defender Sergio Ramos from Real Madrid, where he won four Champions League crowns, and Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma.\n\nMessi is a free agent.\n\nRamos also arrived on a free transfer.\n\nA move to the Parc des Princes would mean a reunion with his Argentina international colleague Angel di Maria.\n\nAn added attraction is that coach Mauricio Pochettino, like Messi, started his career at Newell\u2019s Old Boys in Rosario, Argentina.\n\nPochettino has been giving nothing away on the arrival of Messi.\n\n\u201cThere have been lots of rumours. Lots of things are being said,\u201d he said as PSG laboured to a 2-1 win over Troyes in their opening game of the new league season.\n\nJorge Sampaoli, the Argentine coach of PSG\u2019s bitter rivals Marseille, said the arrival of Messi can only be good news for French football.\n\n\u201cIt would be great for Ligue 1, he\u2019s the best player in the world,\u201d said Sampaoli.\n\n\u201cFrench football has won a lot and grown a lot in recent seasons.\n\n\u201cEven if he goes to a club other than Marseille, it will be good. Everyone would be riveted.

year\u2019s Merdeka will be like no other, courtesy of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nWith most of the Klang Valley and other urban centres under strict lockdown, the usual display of patriotic sentiments will be somewhat drowned out by the pervasive gloom of the moment.\n\nYet, 27 artists have chosen to express their love for the country during the month of Merdeka by displaying their works in an online exhibition titled very simply \u201cJalur Gemilang\u201d.\n\nOpen for viewing until the end of the month, the exhibition is hosted by Artas Galeri, an art gallery based in Petaling Jaya.\n\nAccording to Roy Ng, Artas Galeri\u2019s director, plans were already underway to hold a physical Merdeka-themed exhibition in the months leading up to August.\n\nHowever, with the extension of MCO 3.0, it became painfully clear that Plan B would have to be executed.\n\n\u201cDue to the pandemic and the increasing number of cases, I decided to launch an online show with an e-catalogue instead,\u201d he said.\n\nThat way, art enthusiasts will still be able to view the art pieces themselves without leaving the safety of their homes.\n\n\u201cMost of these artists\u2019 works exhibited in the \u2018Jalur Gemilang\u2019 exhibition are based on our national flag\u2019s colours,\u201d Ng said, adding that a majority of them used copious amounts of red, yellow, blue and white in multiple art styles including abstract, still-life and figurative.\n\nAccording to him, the artists are a fascinating group made up of graduates fresh out of art school as well as senior artists who have made a name for themselves in the art world.\n\nFMT had the pleasure of interviewing six of the artists regarding their hopes for the country this Merdeka month.\n\nYuki Lim Xiao Mun, artist of the almost ethereal \u201cThe Paradise Land\u201d, had this to say: \u201cMy hope for this Merdeka month is that our country can be restored to good condition after the economic hardship caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nShe said it was also her sincere hope that Malaysia\u2019s leaders will lead the country down the right path by practising integrity in their leadership.\n\nLikewise, Fadzril Fakaruddin encouraged Malaysians to stay united no matter what the circumstances, so that together, they could be free of Covid-19 for good.\n\nWhile Hamir Soib hopes for better governance, fellow artist Najib Ahmad Bamadhaj is hopeful for a return to normalcy and the good \u2018ol pre-Covid days.\n\nNational unity is something that veteran artist, Awang Damit, believes is vital if the country is to survive these difficult times.\n\nAnd another artist, Zulkefli Talha, reminded Malaysians to love each other as fellow countrymen regardless of racial or religious differences.\n\n\u201cLeaders have to be good examples for the people. And both leaders and the people have to work together to end this pandemic and return Malaysia to its former glory.\u201d\n\nNg told FMT that the pandemic had been especially tough on many artists. The numerous lockdowns this past year and a half meant potential buyers were unable to view the artworks personally and as a consequence, there was little to no sales.\n\nHe said there was an urgent need for artists to find alternative avenues to display their work so that they could continue to earn a decent living.\n\nNg explained that things have not been looking up for artists for a while now. Prior to the pandemic, the sluggish economy meant artists struggled to make a sale. The lockdowns brought about by the pandemic, only made things worse.\n\n\u201cMost collectors and buyers prefer to see the pieces in person. There\u2019s a huge difference between seeing artworks personally and virtually,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen you view an artwork physically, you will be able to see the texture, notice the colour tones and spot the little details. That\u2019s something these virtual exhibitions sadly cannot offer.\u201d\n\nHowever, this has not dampened the spirit of art collectors such as Brendan Siva in regard to the \u201cJalur Gemilang\u201d exhibition.\n\n\u201cEach piece is unique as an individual interpretation and expression of what Malaysia represents and symbolises in the eyes of the artist. It reflects the rich cultural and social fabric of Malaysia and its people.\u201d\n\nAnother art collector, Bingley Sim added, \u201cThe different styles and approaches in the use of the red, blue, yellow and white colours in the artworks reflect the exuberant spirit of Malaysia.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe works in the \u2018Jalur Gemilang\u2019 exhibition this year are all about resilience, tenacity and hope,\u201d said fellow art collector Cheow Wee.\n\n\u201cArt is a topic that brings people together no matter what ethnicity or religious belief one belongs to.\u201d\n\nHe added that since artists too are experiencing a bad year, it is important for other Malaysians to step up and support them.\n\n\u201cWe want to urge local artists never to give up as many of us will support them in our own little ways. After all, Kita Jaga Kita.\u201d\n\nTo find out more about Artas Galeri, visit them on Instagram, Facebook or WhatsApp 010-9009363 for an e-catalogue.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["exhibition", "art", "local", "pandemic", "month", "works", "merdeka", "view", "artists", "mark", "country", "online", "artist"], "summary": "PETALING JAYA: There\u2019s no question that this year\u2019s Merdeka will be like no other, courtesy of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nYet, 27 artists have chosen to express their love for the country during the month of Merdeka by displaying their works in an online exhibition titled very simply \u201cJalur Gemilang\u201d.\nOpen for viewing until the end of the month, the exhibition is hosted by Artas Galeri, an art gallery based in Petaling Jaya.\nFMT had the pleasure of interviewing six of the artists regarding their hopes for the country this Merdeka month.\n\u201cWe want to urge local artists never to give up as many of us will support them in our own little ways.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-08-13 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "US smash world record in men\u2019s 4x100m medley relay", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9zcG9ydHMvMjAyMS8wOC8wMS91cy1zbWFzaC13b3JsZC1yZWNvcmQtaW4tbWVucy00eDEwMG0tbWVkbGV5LXJlbGF5L9IBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/us-relay-4x100-010821-ap.jpg", "text": "TOKYO: A storming butterfly leg from Caeleb Dressel powered the US to a new world record and the gold medal in the men\u2019s Olympic 4x100m medley relay final today.\n\nThe US team of Ryan Murphy, Michael Andrew, Dressel and Zach Apple touched in 3:26.78s to smash the global 3:27.28s mark set at the 2009 World Championships.\n\nBritain came second in 3:27.51s and Italy were third in 3:29.17s.\n\nThe Americans were trailing at 200m after Andrew\u2019s breaststroke leg against Britain\u2019s Adam Peaty but when Dressel hit the water that all changed.\n\nHe clawed back the lead, leaving Apple to finish the job.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["mens", "water", "4x100m", "leg", "medley", "trailing", "touched", "dressel", "record", "world", "zach", "apple", "todaythe", "smash", "relay", "tokyo"], "summary": "TOKYO: A storming butterfly leg from Caeleb Dressel powered the US to a new world record and the gold medal in the men\u2019s Olympic 4x100m medley relay final today.\nThe US team of Ryan Murphy, Michael Andrew, Dressel and Zach Apple touched in 3:26.78s to smash the global 3:27.28s mark set at the 2009 World Championships.\nBritain came second in 3:27.51s and Italy were third in 3:29.17s.\nThe Americans were trailing at 200m after Andrew\u2019s breaststroke leg against Britain\u2019s Adam Peaty but when Dressel hit the water that all changed.\nHe clawed back the lead, leaving Apple to finish the job.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-08-01 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Meet Ita O\u2019Brian: in-demand intimacy coordinator", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9sZWlzdXJlL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvMjAyMS8wNy8zMC9tZWV0LWl0YS1vYnJpYW4taW4tZGVtYW5kLWludGltYWN5LWNvb3JkaW5hdG9yL9IBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ita-lifestyle.jpg", "text": "LONDON: Britain\u2019s Ita O\u2019Brien is one of entertainment\u2019s unsung stars, ensuring actors are comfortable filming their most sensitive scenes in a job she has made her own.\n\nThe 56-year-old intimacy coordinator has been a key figure behind sex scenes in acclaimed television series such as \u201cI May Destroy You\u201d, \u201cSex Education\u201d and \u201cNormal People\u201d.\n\nPreserving the intimacy of an artist filming a rape depiction, setting up a sex scene with a virgin actor, and identifying the limits each actor is comfortable with are all issues O\u2019Brien is regularly confronted with.\n\nA typical conversation she regularly has with stars, she says, goes along the lines of: \u201cHe is going to put his hand here, you put yours there and then you start the fellatio.\u201d\n\nShe sees her role as one of ensuring \u201copen communication\u201d between the director and the actors on all intimate scenes that may include kissing, nudity or sex.\n\n\u201cThis is a process by which we bring our professional structure to intimacy\u201d, allowing the on-screen stars to \u201cbring all of the skills of the actor to this moment,\u201d she adds.\n\n\u201cWe agree on a consent of touch and then a clear process by which we choreograph the intimate contact clearly. So it\u2019s just like dance.\u201d\n\nEach scene will be discussed and rehearsed beforehand, away from the glare of the dozens of people usually present on a set.\n\n\u201cWhen the camera rolls or they\u2019re up on stage, they know they can perform that intimate contact, knowing where they\u2019re going to be touched,\u201d she says.\n\nAt the heart of her philosophy is consent, in an industry which has been rocked in recent years by sexual assault claims. Her motto, which she says she often repeats to actors, is: \u201cYour \u2018no\u2019 is a gift. Tell us your \u2018no\u2019, so that we can trust your \u2018yes'\u201d.\n\n\u2018Incredibly hard\u2019\n\nO\u2019Brien was a dancer in the theatre for 10 years and then an actress for eight before she sensed an opportunity and became an intimacy coordinator in 2014.\n\nIt was a pioneering move at a time when actors\u2019 consent was little talked about, and before the #MeToo movement against sexual abuse and sexual harassment.\n\nBefore then, \u201cif an actor ever said \u2018no\u2019, they\u2019d be a troublemaker or a diva, and they would certainly be worried about losing their job,\u201d she recalls.\n\nIn such an environment, she describes her early days in the role as \u201cincredibly hard\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had productions where I\u2019ve been told not to speak to the director,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m serving the director\u2019s vision, but the director doesn\u2019t want to speak to me because he\u2019s a 74-year-old man, who basically doesn\u2019t want to acknowledge my existence.\u201d\n\nOn other occasions, she was not allowed on the set because the actors or director did not want her help.\n\nAttitudes have since changed a lot. The profession is becoming more popular and O\u2019Brien is in high demand, especially after Michaela Coel dedicated her best actress BAFTA win this year for \u201cI May Destroy You\u201d to her.\n\n\u201cThank you, Ita, for making a space safe, for creating physical, emotional and professional boundaries, so we can make work about exploitation, loss of respect, about abuse of powers,

Covid jabs per day and are moving towards increasing to 20,000 doses per day. \u2014 Picture by Sayuti Zainudin\n\nFollow us on Instagram and subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates.\n\nGEORGE TOWN, Aug 1 \u2014 Factories and small businesses in Penang, especially those hard hit by disruptions due to the Covid-19 pandemic, are looking forward to resuming operations as soon as possible even if it means making vaccination mandatory for their workers.\n\nAs there are currently no laws to enforce mandatory Covid-19 vaccination on workers, some companies are taking steps to get their workers to register for vaccination.\n\nPenang Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM) chairman Datuk Jimmy Ong said most factories here are encouraging their workers to register for their Covid jabs through various methods.\n\n\u201cSome companies are giving paid leave to their workers to go for vaccination and some are even offering monetary rewards,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the main reason multinational companies (MNC) are setting up Program Imunisasi Industri Covid-19 Kerjasama Awam-Swasta (Pikas) vaccination centres within their own factory grounds is to encourage their workers to get vaccinated.\n\nHe said the Pikas PPVs in Penang are now dispensing 15,000 doses per day and are moving towards increasing to 20,000 doses per day.\n\nHe said the vaccination of workers in MNCs is progressing very fast due to the on-site PPVs for larger factories which employ thousands of workers.\n\n\u201cIt is slower for small medium enterprises as they can only send their workers to the Pikas PPVs and there are only two of those now; one in Jawi and one at Equatorial Hotel,\u201d he said.\n\nEven with vaccination in full force, Ong said some of the companies in the manufacturing sector have continued to conduct screening of workers every two to three weeks.\n\n\u201cScreening still has to continue to control any potential spread of cases within the factories because we know, even those vaccinated still have a risk of contracting Covid-19,\u201d he said.\n\nFMM Penang branch offers a Penang SAFE programme for factories to conduct screening tests for its workers at a lower rate of RM60 per person.\n\nOng said the programme recommends that any company taking up the package conduct screening of 100 per cent of its staff in the first round.\n\n\u201cAfter that, they can conduct screening on 20 per cent of their staff for the second round and another 20 per cent on the third round, and so on,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, one of the SMEs in Penang, Chemdyes Sdn Bhd, has checked labour laws on ways to compel its employees to get vaccinated.\n\nThe company\u2019s managing director Joe Sidek said it was informed that there are at present no laws for the company to compel its employees to register for vaccination.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t legally force them to register for vaccination, it is a personal right, so what we do is to encourage them to do it as a way to safeguard everyone\u2019s safety in the workplace,\u201d he said.\n\nThe factory, specialising in textile chemicals, has about 22 workers and Joe said all have registered for vaccination.\n\nA nurse administers a dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at the Pikas vaccination centre at the Bukit Jawi Golf Resort in Penang June 17, 2021. \u2014 Picture by Sayuti Zainudin\n\nHe said despite the downturn in the textile industry due to the pandemic, Chemdyes recorded stable revenue last year and expects an increase in revenue this year.\n\n\u201cWe have kept all our staff and did not cut any pay so we have been very fortunate and we want to ensure that everyone is safe, we do not want to have any cases that could disrupt production,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said he would allow his workers to stay home for a week and to undergo screening tests if they have been exposed to places with a high number of Covid-19 cases.\n\nMeanwhile, it was reported that the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) is considering making vaccination of all employees in the retail sector one of the pre-conditions for approval for companies to resume operation, during the National Recovery Plan (NRP) period.\n\nYin\u2019s Sourdough Bakery and cafe co-founder Ong Seng Keat has already made it compulsory for all of its 40 workers to sign up for vaccination.\n\n\u201cWe will check our workers\u2019 MySejahtera to make sure they have registered and if we have to pay for it, we will,\u201d he said.\n\nHis company has already paid for all of his workers in Klang Valley to be vaccinated under a retail industry vaccination programme.\n\nHe hopes such programmes will be available in Penang so he can send all his workers to be vaccinated as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cThe government really needs to speed up its vaccination programme for the economic frontliners because we deal with people every day,\u201d he said.\n\nMugshot Cafe co-founder Jesse Tan agrees with Ong that vaccination for economic frontliners should be sped up.\n\n\u201cSo far, all of our staff have registered for vaccination but they are still waiting for their appointments,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of Mugshot\u2019s staff contracted Covid-19 a few months back due to close contact with a relative but fortunately, it did not spread to the other staff in the cafe.\n\n\u201cThere are 15 of us in the cafe and all of us went for screening the moment we found out he was positive but luckily, we were all negative,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the incident further emphasises the importance of vaccination for all workers who deal with customers daily.\n\nAs for Hin Bus Depot manager Tan Shih Thoe, he is also considering only allowing fully vaccinated vendors to participate in the Hin Bus Depot weekly bazaar, when they are finally allowed to reopen.\n\n\u201cI was just thinking about this, especially for the market, whether I should only allow vendors who are fully vaccinated to participate... main consideration is their safety since the market is considered a crowded space,\u201d he said.\n\nThere used to be 70 vendors at the weekly market before the pandemic but due to standard operating procedures (SOPs), the number of vendors came down to around 55 each week.\n\nThe market has been closed for more than two months due to the movement control order (MCO) and subsequent phases of the NRP.\n\nHin Bus Depot has around 15 tenants, consisting of eateries and artisans, and Tan said he will also strongly encourage the tenants and their workers to register for vaccination.\n\n\u201cMost of them are in favour of vaccination as they see it as the only solution to things getting back to normal,\u201d he said.\n\nFurry Kids pet shop owner Dalbinder Singh also agrees that it is important for those in the retail sector to be vaccinated.\n\n\u201cWe are meeting people and customers daily so it is important for the safety of everyone,\u201d he

Here\u2019s what you need to know:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Can employers make vaccination compulsory for employees?\n\nEmployment lawyer Donovan Cheah said there is no law now that disallows mandatory vaccination policies by employers, and that there are no known court cases in the country about whether such a policy would be legal.\n\n\u201cGiven the severity of the pandemic, having a mandatory vaccination policy is one of the ways for employers to safeguard the safety and health of their employees and curb the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cHowever, there are no reported court cases in Malaysia about the legality of mandatory vaccination policies, and whether an employer can take disciplinary action against an employee for refusing to vaccinate,\u201d he said, but noted there have been reported cases in countries like Australia and the US which upheld the dismissal of employees who refuse to comply with their employer\u2019s mandatory vaccination policy.\n\nSpecialist employment lawyer Marcus van Geyzel said employers would generally be able to make it compulsory for their employees to undergo COVID-19 vaccination if this is due to a government-imposed requirement.\n\n\u201cYes, if the MDTCA/KPDNHEP makes employee vaccinations mandatory or a pre-condition for approval to operate, the affected employers can impose this requirement on employees,\u201d he told Malay Mail.\n\n\u201cHowever, employers should be cautious where there are special circumstances, such as where an employee is unable to receive a vaccination due to a medical condition,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIn general, it would be very unlikely for an employee to successfully challenge an employer\u2019s mandatory vaccination policy where vaccinations have been declared a pre-condition for operations by the government.\n\nIn order to bring a successful legal action, an employee would have to show that in mandating vaccination, the employer has exercised its managerial power in a non-genuine manner, or that there was victimisation or an unfair labour practice,\u201d he said.\n\n2. What if the employees say no to vaccination?\n\nCheah said employers can choose to take disciplinary action against employees who refuse vaccination, and that whether such action is reasonable depends on the situation.\n\n\u201cWhile an employer cannot physically compel an employee to take the vaccine, an employee\u2019s freedom of choice is not the same thing as freedom from consequences. There are no legal prohibitions against an employer implementing a mandatory vaccination policy, although how employers deal with breaches of this policy may be evaluated by the courts,\u201d he said.\n\nCheah said disciplinary action including dismissal may be seen as reasonable, taking into account various factors.\n\nHe listed examples such as the employee\u2019s reason for refusal; whether the employee\u2019s refusal amounts to a breach of their duties or has caused loss or damage to the company or other employees; whether the employee\u2019s job function requires him/her to have regular and frequent physical interaction with third parties.\n\nOther factors listed by Cheah are the current severity of the pandemic; whether the employer\u2019s business deals with high-risk individuals; and whether vaccination is a pre-condition from the authorities for the employer to operate.\n\n\u201cWhere an employee has a legitimate reason to refuse vaccination (eg: health condition), employers should explore other ways to address the risk, such as requiring them to carry out their duties remotely and not allowing them to enter the premises without notice,\u201d Cheah added.\n\nVan Geyzel said employers would have several options, when vaccinations are a precondition for operations but there are employees who refuse to get vaccinated.\n\nThese options are to engage with the employees, or to transfer employees to alternative roles, or to ultimately stop employing the employee.\n\n\u201cThe first step should always be for employers to have clear and open conversations with these employees to ensure that they understand the reason for the vaccination requirement.\n\n\u201cEmployers can also consider redesignating or redeploying the affected employees to other roles within the business which are not customer-facing and which may be exempted from the regulatory requirements,\u201d he said.\n\nIf redesignation and redeployment is not an option, employers would be legally able to terminate the employee\u2019s employment if it is reasonable in the circumstances, he said.\n\nVan Geyzel said there is a general legal expectation that an employee has to follow all lawful and reasonable instructions by the employer.\n\nHe added that it can be argued that an employee is carrying out an act of insubordination by refusing to be vaccinated under the circumstances, as the employee is wilfully disobeying a lawful and reasonable order issued by the employer.\n\n\u201cAny punishment or action by the employer in response to insubordination has to be reasonable or proportionate, and it can be said here that where the result of the employee\u2019s vaccination is that the business would not be allowed to operate, there are serious repercussions and therefore termination of employment is a reasonable response by the employer.\n\n\u201cAnother potential justification for termination of employment is that an unvaccinated employee would be unable to perform the job or service for which the employee was employed. This would be the case if an unvaccinated employee is not permitted by law to work.\n\n\u201cIn such a situation, it may be reasonable for an employer to deem that the employment contract cannot be performed and therefore can be terminated,\u201d he said.\n\n3. What if an employee says no to vaccination due to health conditions?\n\nAs for employees who are unable to receive COVID-19 vaccinations due to a medical condition, van Geyzel said employers could explore measures such as redesignation.\n\n\u201cFirstly, I don\u2019t think the government would make vaccinations mandatory for such employees.\n\n\u201cSecondly, even if the government issued a blanket requirement, the employer should see if it\u2019s possible to apply for an exemption for that employee, or again see if redeployment or redesignation is an option.\n\n\u201cTermination should always be a last resort, but if the employer has acted reasonably, then termination should be possible under the law,\u201d he said, also saying that an employee would be unlikely to succeed in an unfair dismissal claim if an employer treated the employee fairly and could show that the termination was reasonable in the circumstances.\n\nFor employees with pre-existing health conditions that prevent them from being vaccinated, employment lawyer Jayasingam Poopalasingam said employers can seek to take mitigation measures such as changing their work roles or have them work remotely.\n\nHowever, if the nature of the business and nature of the employee\u2019s work requires vaccination, but vaccination is not possible due to the health condition and mitigating measures are not feasible through no fault of both the employer or the employee, the employer may be left with no choice but to terminate employment.\n\nThe employee could under such circumstances file a complaint to claim that the dismissal was without just cause and excuse, but it would ultimately be for the Industrial Court to decide if the dismissal was with just cause and excuse, he said.\n\n4. Putting it into the employment contract and putting it in writing\n\nJayasingam, who is also co-chair of the Bar Council\u2019s Industrial and Employment Law Committee, similarly said there are currently no laws that mandate COVID-19 vaccination for employees.\n\nThis means that for existing employees, an employer cannot \u201cforce\u201d them to be vaccinated, but can only seek to persuade and convince the employee of the need to be vaccinated due to reasons such as the nature of the work.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing much you can do, you cannot force the employee to go for vaccination, you cannot force an employee to undergo a medical procedure, it has to be by way of consent,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf they are existing employees, it must be by way of consent. They have a right to refuse vaccination, that\u2019s why we advise employers to obtain the written consent of employees to be vaccinated,\u201d he said, explaining that a mere verbal consent is not advisable as an employee could later claim to have never given consent.\n\nFor employees who pose a high risk due to the nature of their job as a frontliner or being in contact with others but refuse vaccination, employers can transfer them to another position where they do not deal with customers or other employees, he said.\n\nBut for new employees, an employer can make being vaccinated against COVID-19 a part of the employment contract prior to them joining the company, he said.\n\n\u201cYou cannot force it but what you can do is if you are having new employees, you can put it as a term of the contract, where they must be vaccinated before they are hired for employment, or they must undertake they will be vaccinated after they join you,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the new recruit would have the option of not joining the company upon viewing the contract, while employers can terminate employment if the new hire subsequently does not comply with instructions to be vaccinated as promised under the contract.\n\n5. About legal action\n\nIf an employer forces an employee to undergo COVID-19 vaccination, the employee can possibly walk out of the job and try to claim \u201cconstructive dismissal\u201d, Jayasingam said.\n\nIn cases of constructive dismissal claims, the employer does not have to issue a letter of termination, but the employee is essentially claiming that the employer has done something in breach of his contractual rights and that the employer\u2019s conduct had resulted in the employee\u2019s resignation.\n\nSuch an employee could then seek to prove their case in the Industrial Court to claim for monetary compensation and reinstatement to the job with all previous benefits and rights unaffected, including the right to not be forced to be vaccinated, Jayasingam said. It would ultimately be for the Industrial Court to decide if there was constructive dismissal.\n\nAlternatively, employees can also file a claim in civil courts but this is usually not preferred as the compensation is very small, with most employees likely to go to the Industrial Court instead, he said.\n\nUnlike new employees who have agreed to being vaccinated under the employment contract and can be terminated for non-compliance, Jayasingam said employers could face labour complaints by existing employees if the latter are terminated over their non-vaccinated status.\n\n\u201cIf the employer terminates them for not being vaccinated, the employee can file a complaint of dismissal without just cause and excuse,\u201d he said, explaining the process as involving employees filing complaints with the Industrial Relations Department under the Human Resources Ministry within 60 days of dismissal to see whether it could be resolved amicably, with the matter to be referred by the department director-general to the Industrial Court if it cannot be resolved.\n\nBut in situations where it is a government requirement for staff to be vaccinated in order to operate, an employer may have reason to terminate an employee who refuses to get vaccinated if it affects the business, Jayasingam said.\n\n\u201cSo the employer may have just cause and excuse to terminate the employee because he cannot carry on business,\u201d he said.\n\nJayasingam gave a hypothetical example, where an employee who works as a carer at a nursing home refuses to be vaccinated when it is a government requirement for such work, and the carer may as a result pose a risk to the elderly persons at the nursing home.\n\nIn such a situation and where there are no mitigation measures possible, the employer \u2014 who is unable to force the employee to be vaccinated \u2014 may opt to terminate the employee as it affects the business or may result in the nursing home having to be closed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s for the Industrial Court to decide whether what the employer did was reasonable or not,\u201d he said.\n\n6. Can the government make COVID-19 vaccination mandatory for employees?\n\nVan Geyzel said there may be a stronger basis for a compulsory vaccination requirement by the government for certain industries.\n\n\u201cThe laws that have been passed in response to the pandemic grant the government very broad powers to impose SOPs or pre-conditions for businesses to operate, and when it comes to roles or industries that have clear and frequent face-to-face contact and interaction with the general public, there is a stronger justification for the authorities to impose mandatory vaccination requirements. This is especially so as vaccinations are widely available and accessible.\n\n\u201cHowever, if the government overreaches and tries to impose mandatory vaccinations on other roles or industries where there is no clear face-to-face interaction or risk, I could see this being open to legal challenge,\u201d he said.\n\nJayasingam said the government could impose mandatory vaccinations on the general population including employees by passing an Act in Parliament, but believes that implementing such a policy of forcing vaccinations would only be a \u201clast resort.\u201d \u2014 Malay Mail", "keyword": ["vaccination", "employee", "employer", "say", "staff", "heres", "employers", "lawyers", "employees", "employment", "mandatory", "covid19", "vaccinated", "reasonable", "vaccinations"], "summary": "\u201cYes, if the MDTCA/KPDNHEP makes employee vaccinations mandatory or a pre-condition for approval to operate, the affected employers can impose this requirement on employees,\u201d he told Malay Mail.\n\u201cIn general, it would be very unlikely for an employee to successfully challenge an employer\u2019s mandatory vaccination policy where vaccinations have been declared a pre-condition for operations by the government.\n\u201cFirstly, I don\u2019t think the government would make vaccinations mandatory for such employees.\nCan the government make COVID-19 vaccination mandatory for employees?\n\u201cHowever, if the government overreaches and tries to impose mandatory vaccinations on other roles or industries where there is no clear face-to-face interaction or risk, I could see this being open to legal challenge,\u201d he said.", "news": "SoyaCincau.com", "date": "2021-08-02 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Ministry mulls proposal to control price of Covid-19 test kit", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbGF5bWFpbC5jb20vbmV3cy9tYWxheXNpYS8yMDIxLzA4LzAzL21pbmlzdHJ5LW11bGxzLXByb3Bvc2FsLXRvLWNvbnRyb2wtcHJpY2Utb2YtY292aWQtMTktdGVzdC1raXQvMTk5NDkwMtIBfGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbGF5bWFpbC5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wOC8wMy9taW5pc3RyeS1tdWxscy1wcm9wb3NhbC10by1jb250cm9sLXByaWNlLW9mLWNvdmlkLTE5LXRlc3Qta2l0LzE5OTQ5MDI?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://media2.malaymail.com/resize_cache/uploads/articles/2021/2021-07/covid_test_kit2_26072021-seo.jpg", "text": "Deputy Minister Datuk Rosol Wahid said based on feedback from the public, the test kit price is a burden especially to the low-income groups and families with many children. \u2014 Bernama pic\n\nFollow us on Instagram and subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates.\n\nKUALA BERANG, Aug 3 \u2015 The Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) is considering a proposal to control the price of the Covid-19 test kit, said Deputy Minister Datuk Rosol Wahid.\n\nHe said based on feedback from the public, the test kit price is a burden especially to the low-income groups and families with many children.\n\n\u201cWe were told that the price is RM39.90 each, not many can afford to buy it at that price.

Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on household income and made more people poorer, according to a study conducted by the Department of Statistics.\n\nThe Covid-19 impact study on household income in Malaysia for 2020 revealed that the number of poor households increased to 639,800 in 2020, up from 405,400 in 2019.\n\nThe findings of the study are contained in the Household Income Estimates and Incidence of Poverty Report, Malaysia, 2020 which the department released today.\n\nChief Statistician Datuk Seri Dr Mohd Uzir Mahidin said in a statement that the incidence of absolute poverty also increased, from 5.6 per cent in 2019 to 8.4 per cent in 2020, and that the incidence of hardcore poverty is estimated to increase from 0.4 per cent (2019) involving 27,200 households to 1.0 per cent involving 78,000 households.\n\nHe said the pandemic had also affected the structure of household groups, with 20 per cent of households from the M40 group with income between RM4,850 and RM10,959 having moved to the B40 group.\n\n\u201cHouseholds in the T20 group were also affected by the Covid-19 pandemic where 12.8 per cent of this group has shifted to the M40 group,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also said that as the percentage decrease in income for B40 and M40 households was larger than the T20 households group, the income distribution for B40 and M40 declined to 15.9 per cent (2019: 16.0 per cent) and 36.9 per cent (2019: 37.2 per cent), respectively.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the T20 group owned 47.2 per cent of income increased by 0.4 percentage points from 2019,\u201d he added.\n\nMohd Uzir said the mean of monthly household gross income decreased by negative 10.3 per cent to record RM7,089 as compared to RM7,901 in 2019 and added that the decline was contributed by households or individuals who experienced loss or reduction of income, particularly those with the status of employee, self-employed and others.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, this reduction of income was not only caused by job loss but also contributed by the reduction of working hours and increase in skill-related underemployment,\u201d he said.\n\nMohd Uzir said that all territories/states recorded a decline in mean and median of monthly household gross income. The Federal Territory of Putrajaya registered the lowest reduction in monthly household income and remained to record the highest mean and median of monthly household gross income as compared to other territories/states with RM12,322 and RM9,743, respectively.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, Kelantan remained to record the lowest mean and median income with RM4,411 and RM3,010, respectively,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also said that the incidence of absolute poverty by state shows that Sabah recorded the highest percentage of 25.3 per cent (2019: 19.5 per cent) while Kelantan recorded a significant increase in poverty by 8.8 percentage points to 21.2 per cent from 12.4 per cent (2019), followed by Terengganu by 5.9 percentage points to 12 per cent from 6.1 per cent (2019).\n\nMohd Uzir said the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic may be temporary as the economy is expected to improve and recover as the spread of the pandemic can be contained.\n\n\u201cFrom this analysis, it is found that the role of the federal and state governments as well as other relevant parties is pertinent in cushioning the impact of the pandemic as well as towards reviving the household income and the country\u2019s economy,\u201d he said.- Bernama", "keyword": ["study", "households", "poverty", "2019", "income", "household", "cent", "covid19", "uzir", "impact", "pandemic", "reveals", "percentage", "group", "significant"], "summary": "KUALA LUMPUR: The Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on household income and made more people poorer, according to a study conducted by the Department of Statistics.\nThe Covid-19 impact study on household income in Malaysia for 2020 revealed that the number of poor households increased to 639,800 in 2020, up from 405,400 in 2019.\nThe findings of the study are contained in the Household Income Estimates and Incidence of Poverty Report, Malaysia, 2020 which the department released today.\nMohd Uzir said that all territories/states recorded a decline in mean and median of monthly household gross income.\nThe Federal Territory of Putrajaya registered the lowest reduction in monthly household income and remained to record the highest mean and median of monthly household gross income as compared to other territories/states with RM12,322 and RM9,743, respectively.", "news": "The Sun Daily", "date": "2021-08-06 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Not so slick: Domestic Trade Ministry foils attempt to misappropriate 18,000kg of cooking oil", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEEHgxPt-i917aEqtS9q5XVIqGQgEKhAIACoHCAow-N7eCjC60NYBMLfbhwM?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Santhakumar A L"], "top-image": "https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2021/08/11/1252988.jpg", "text": "SHAH ALAM (Bernama): The Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry has foiled an attempt to misappropriate 18,000kg of cooking oil, 8,775 kg of which were subsidised 1kg packets.\n\nThe ministry's Selangor director Muhammad Zikril Azan Abdullah said raids carried out on two stores in Puchong found that the embezzlement activity was done by cutting the 1kg packets of subsidised cooking oil and transferring them to a skid tank to be bottled as 2kg and 5kg and sold for higher prices.\n\nHe said four locals and a foreigner, suspected to be an Indonesian, between the age of 30 and 50, identified as the owners of the premises were arrested to assist in the investigation.\n\nHe added that two lorries, a skid tank, forklift, cut 1kg plastic packets and bottles of cooking oil used to make the transfer were confiscated.

earnings in the second half of the financial year 2021 (2H21), underpinned by higher exports volume and refining margins.\n\nCGS-CIMB Securities Sdn Bhd analysts Nagulan Ravi and Ivy Ng Lee Fang, in a research report, stated that MSM have rightly hedged 99% of its financial year 2021 forecast (FY21F) domestic wholesale raw sugar requirement at US$0.13 (RM0.55) to US$0.14 per pounds (lbs) and 43% of its FY22F requirement at US$0.15-0.16/lbs.\n\nLast year\u2019s raw sugar price averaged at US$0.13-0.14/lbs.\n\n\u201cThis bodes well for MSM given raw sugar prices have been trending higher over the past 18 months to US$0.185/lbs currently, due to supply disruptions in Brazil and Thailand,\u201d the analysts stated in the report yesterday, following a recent update from the company\u2019s management.\n\nThe analysts stated that MSM expects a 10% year-on-year (YoY) growth in its domestic sales volumes in FY21F and has raised its average selling prices (ASPs) for both the wholesale (up to the maximum ceiling price of RM2.69 per kg) and industry segments.\n\nThe higher ASPs and sales volumes would help boost MSM\u2019s domestic refining margins in 2H21F, they added.\n\nRavi and Ng further stated that MSM had secured export contracts worth 65% to 70% of its original 300,000MT export sales target for FY21F.\n\n\u201cThe group is now optimistic of delivering close to 350,000MT of export sales in FY21F, in line with our forecast of 340,000MT, which is a 25% YoY growth versus FY20,\u201d Ravi and Ng added.\n\nThey said the higher export volumes would be driven by stronger demand from its largest export destination, Vietnam, which accounts for around 50% of its exports, and other countries that have reopened from Covid-19 restrictions.\n\nIncreased demand for its value-added products such as liquid sugar, fine syrup and premix products could increase volumes.\n\nThe analysts viewed exports growth would lower refining costs at the group\u2019s refinery in Johor.\n\n\u201cPost the optimisation of its Johor refinery, MSM expects to achieve a 50% utilisation factor (UF) for its Johor refinery in 2H21.\n\n\u201cWe project the Johor refinery could return to the black in FY22F as we project a 52% UF for the year, driven by higher exports volumes,\u201d Ravi and Ng added.\n\nCGS-CIMB forecast MSM to deliver Ebitda margins of 10.9% to 12.4% in FY21-23F, led by higher domestic and export margins and more robust export volumes.\n\n\u201cWe raise our FY21-23F earnings per share forecast by 1.5% to 6.9% to reflect lower refining costs and higher export premiums.\n\n\u201cIn light of this, we raise our target price (TP) to RM1.69 based on a price/net tangible asset (P/ NTA) of 1.2 times (one standard deviation below MSM\u2019s 10-year average P/NTA) versus one time previously,\u201d the analysts wrote.\n\nThe brokerage firm also upgraded MSM to \u2018Add\u2019 as the stock offers a 25% upside to its TP and attractive dividend yields of 6.1% to 7.5% in FY21-23F.\n\nFurther key catalysts include potential equity placements to collaborative partners and the completion of the sale of MSM Perlis, which will allow the MSM group to book a one-off gain from the disposal of the land of RM91.6 million at 13 sen per share.\n\nThe analysts attributed key risks to lower export margins and rising raw sugar prices.\n\nMSM is currently working on doubling its liquid sugar facility\u2019s capacity and enhancing its fine syrup facility due to the rising demand for these products.\n\nIn the longer term, the \u201cGula Prai\u201d producer plans to expand its export segment further by increasing its regional presence in the Asia-Pacific region and establishing a local presence in countries such as China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Singapore, Indonesia and South Korea.\n\nAs of 2019, MSM corroborated up to 60% of the domestic market share and ranked the eighth largest sugar refiner globally by capacity.\n\nMSM share price declined 2.22% to RM1.32 yesterday, valuing the company RM927.93 million.", "keyword": ["export", "earnings", "sugar", "poised", "2h", "higher", "domestic", "volumes", "refining", "msm", "stated", "sales", "stronger",

integrated nature of the Asean\u2019s supply chain, the impact from Vietnam\u2019s Covid-19 woes which culminated in the extension of lockdown measures under the government\u2019s Directive 16 in various provinces in the south are felt by Malaysian businesses that have a presence there.\n\nThe directive stipulates the closure of non-essential businesses, ban on public gatherings and severely limited transport services, in an attempt to contain the wave of Covid Delta variant infections.\n\nIn the past, Vietnam enjoyed success in containing the pandemic attributed to prompt border closure and lockdown measures, as well as an extensive testing and contact tracing strategy.\n\nVietnam recorded 8,324 new Covid-19 cases on Friday, according to the country\u2019s Ministry of Health. The new infections brought the total tally to 193,381, with 3,016 deaths, the ministry said.\n\nCurrently, 19 southern localities in the country, including Ho Chi Minh City, have implemented a lockdown via Directive 16 until Aug 16. Meanwhile, The lockdown in Hanoi, Vietnam\u2019s capital, has been extended by 15 days until Aug 22.\n\nAs a result, a number of Bursa Malaysia-listed issuers with facilities in Vietnam have reported suspension of operations there.\n\nYBS International Bhd\n\nIts subsidiary, Oriental Fastech Manufacturing (Vietnam), which is involved in high precision metal fabrication and assembly, is partially suspending its operations to comply with the government\u2019s directive.\n\nMagni-Tech Industries Bhd\n\nIts garment production facilities in Vietnam have been suspended in line with the government\u2019s directive. The group is mitigating the impact of the closure via close engagement with its customers to manage the production capacity challenges as well as rescheduling delivery dates to meet customer\u2019s demand. It is assessing the impact of the closure on its financial performance and announcements will be made if there is any material development.\n\nPoh Huat Resources Holdings Bhd\n\nThe group\u2019s subsidiary, Poh Huat Furniture Industries Vietnam Joint Stock Co, which has factories in Binh Duong Province and Dong Nai Province, has halted production activities in line with the lockdown order. As of July 21, it said none of its employees in the two locations has exhibited any Covid-19 symptoms and it will undertake screening and quarantine measures should any employee exhibit symptoms or be confirmed positive of the virus.\n\nConsequently, the production interruption is expected to cause delay in the shipment of orders to its customers in the US. Poh Huat\u2019s management is in discussions with affected customers to reschedule their delivery dates for affected orders. It said it is able to mitigate some of the impact from the closure as it has a certain amount of ready inventory to meet the orders and it will increase production with extended shifts upon resumption of production activities, if necessary.\n\nLatitude Tree Holdings Bhd\n\nTwo of the group\u2019s subsidiaries, Latitude Tree Vietnam Joint Stock Co and RK Resources Co Ltd, are partially suspending operations to comply with Vietnam\u2019s Directive 16.

This approach will allow it to operate at a reduced production capacity.\n\nLatitude Tree estimates the production loss from the \u20183 on the spot\u2019 approach to be around 1.2% to 1.8% of its total forecast annual output volume for FY2022.\n\n", "keyword": ["fallout", "grapple", "lockdown", "directive", "tree", "firms", "16", "vietnams", "production", "vietnam", "bursalisted", "closure", "customers", "covid", "impact", "presence", "malaysian"], "summary": "In the past, Vietnam enjoyed success in containing the pandemic attributed to prompt border closure and lockdown measures, as well as an extensive testing and contact tracing strategy.\nCurrently, 19 southern localities in the country, including Ho Chi Minh City, have implemented a lockdown via Directive 16 until Aug 16.\nAs a result, a number of Bursa Malaysia-listed issuers with facilities in Vietnam have reported suspension of operations there.\nMagni-Tech Industries BhdIts garment production facilities in Vietnam have been suspended in line with the government\u2019s directive.\nLatitude Tree Holdings BhdTwo of the group\u2019s subsidiaries, Latitude Tree Vietnam Joint Stock Co and RK Resources Co Ltd, are partially suspending operations to comply with Vietnam\u2019s Directive 16.", "news": "The Sun Daily", "date": "2021-08-08 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Introduce code of ethics for elected reps \u2013 Rais", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWJvcm5lb3Bvc3QuY29tLzIwMjEvMDgvMDcvaW50cm9kdWNlLWNvZGUtb2YtZXRoaWNzLWZvci1lbGVjdGVkLXJlcHMtcmFpcy_SAQA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2021/07/FW1176796_KL19_19072021_DEWAN-lpr.jpg", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR (Aug 7): Dewan Negara president Tan Sri Dr Rais Yatim has suggested that a code of ethics for elected representatives be introduced to members of Parliament and assemblymen to make them respected and exemplary leaders.\n\nIn his writing in the Journal of the Malaysian Parliament entitled \u2018Etika Legislatif untuk Wakil Rakyat\u2019 (Legislative Ethics for Elected Representatives), he said the code of ethics was also important to \u2018control\u2019 and \u2018discipline\u2019 elected representatives when taking part in debate sessions.\n\nRais said since Parliament is a place where the country\u2019s leaders are born, members must also consist of those with qualified academic qualifications and are well mannered.\n\nHowever, he said, in reality and based on the Parliament Hansard, the behavior, speech and debating style of elected representatives in the Malaysian Parliament was moving backward, he said, referring to the speech by three MPs who used offensive language in 2018.\n\nTherefore, Rais said changes in internal and external legislative work should be initiated, including the introduction of a code of ethics for the elected representatives that can be enforced in accordance with the Houses of Parliament (Privileges and Powers) Act 1952 (Act 347) or through the setting up of a special committee under Dewan Rakyat, Dewan Negara or state legislative assemblies.\n\nFor Dewan Negara, he said the motion to establish the code of ethics for elected representatives can be made under Standing Order 13 (2) 31 of the Senate.\n\nRais also suggested that training courses be given to MPs and assemblymen to ensure that they become elected representatives with integrity and have extensive legal knowledge.\n\n\u201cMake it mandatory for all elected representatives to undergo at least six months of training.

We propose postponing the relaxation to a time determined by a clear set of publicised criteria,\u201d Malaysia Health Coalition (MHC) said in a statement yesterday.\n\nThe coalition of medical experts added that at the moment, only 27% of the population of all ages were fully vaccinated, and this excludes undocumented migrants.\n\n\u201cChile only relaxed restrictions after 50% coverage, and Singapore is targeting relaxed restrictions at 70% coverage,\u201d MHC added.\n\nOn Sunday, Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin announced that among the restrictions being lifted for fully vaccinated individuals who reside in states under Phase 2 and above of the National Recovery Plan (NRP), include dine-ins, inter-district travel, sports and recreational activities without physical contact as well as tourism activities within the state involving homestays and hotels.\n\n\u201cIn allowing the relaxation, the government will also ensure public health strategic plans, which are now on the right track, continue to be implemented, especially through screenings, close contact detection, isolation measures, as well as improving healthcare capacity and treatment options,\u201d he said.\n\nMHC, however, stated that scientific and public health criteria for relaxation must be built by health experts without interference.\n\n\u201cThey can include \u2018fully vaccinated rate \u226570% of the total population, total critical care bed occupancy rate for Covid-19 of \u226490%, total daily new cases \u22644000 with share of positive tests \u22645%\u2019 and other criteria. These criteria must be publicised so that any future decisions will be solely based on evidence,\u201d MHC explained.\n\nAdditionally, the coalition said the government should clarify the specifics of these relaxed restrictions, because blanket vaccine privileges will create loopholes that will impede NRP.\n\n\u201cFor example, the government must answer questions like: What is the rationale to allow home quarantine for vaccinated travellers, how long is the quarantine and how will we monitor? How do we close the loopholes that may allow \u2018inter-state vacations on the pretext of visiting our children?\u2019\u201d it said.\n\nMeanwhile, Malaysian Medical Association (MMA) president Datuk Dr Subramaniam Muniandy said the decision to relax restrictions must be supported with sufficient scientific evidence.\n\n\u201cIf it is indeed a decision based on science, why then is travel allowed for those wishing to see their spouse or their young children? Either it\u2019s sufficiently safe for the fully vaccinated to travel, in which case all vaccinated individuals should be allowed to do so, or it is not, in which nobody should travel,\u201d he said.\n\nHe noted that some of those states in Phase 2 are showing an increasing trend in Covid-19 cases.\n\n\u201cThe government should stop its hyping up on the total number of cases. What is important are hospital bed utilisation and the intensive care units (ICUs) situation in the country,\u201d Dr Subramaniam said.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, we hope that the government will provide an update on the positivity rate and the status of bed utilisation and ICUs in each state as these will be more meaningful indicators apart from the daily new cases. It is important that the public be kept informed of the bed capacity and ICUs status in their respective state,\u201d he added.\n\nMMA also said that the lifting of restrictions must also take into account high-risk groups such as nursing homes, factory and construction workers, security guards, cleaners, medical students and undocumented migrant workers that have not been vaccinated.",

skin and hair.\n\nETX Daily Up is focussing on a few that should help convince you to either concoct your own treatments, or embrace some of the numerous cosmetic formulations based on this precious ingredient.\n\nCaffeine, an active ingredient that shouldn\u2019t be ignored\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon to find cosmetics formulated with caffeine, an active ingredient known for its slimming and firming benefits.\n\nGenerally, it is found in creams, gels, and other beauty products designed to help lose a few centimetres on the hips, thighs, or buttocks, as well as in anti-cellulite products or formulations designed to help users improve toning or firmness.\n\nBut caffeine is also present in certain facial care products, again with the aim of fighting skin slackening, but also \u2013 and above all \u2013 to improve the appearance of the eye contour area and reduce puffiness and dark circles (it can be even more effective if the product has spent some time in the refrigerator).\n\nCreams, gels, masks, cleansers: caffeine is nowadays found in products at all price points in the cosmetic departments of department stores and specialised shops.\n\nIn the form of powder and grounds\n\nWith the advent of DIY beauty, coffee now shows up in many so-called \u201chomemade\u201d recipes in the form of powder or grounds.\n\nRich in caffeine, these formulations can offer the advantages mentioned above, but are also powerful antioxidants, which allows them to fight against certain effects seen on mature skins, and more generally against skin aging.\n\nIn addition to these inherent virtues, coffee grounds, thanks to their specific texture, also make for a great exfoliant for sloughing off dead cells.\n\nAll you need to do is mix it with other ingredients: egg white for a mask, vegetable oil and honey for a face and body scrub, or even on its own to exfoliate scalp and hair to make it shinier.\n\nOver on TikTok, known for being the go-to social network for DIY beauty recipes, one can also discover a multitude of recipes for masks and scrubs made from soluble coffee or coffee beans.\n\nRecipes that users seem to have not only tested but also

collaborating with GE Digital on aircraft fuel efficiency monitoring solutions as part of the carrier\u2019s initiatives to meet its sustainability goals.\n\nThe national flag carrier adopted GE Digital\u2019s Fuel Insight and FlightPulse aviation software to transform and modernise the airline\u2019s fuel efficiency programme.\n\nMAB has implemented various initiatives including efficiency measures, investments in sustainability solutions and waste reduction across its operations to address its sustainability goals.\n\nThe fuel efficiency programme has been running for over a decade, contributing to a 15% fuel burn improvement recorded over the past eight years.\n\nMAB\u2019s group operations officer, Ahmad Luqman Mohd Azmi, stated promoting sustainability in all of the MAB\u2019s operations has always been a top priority.\n\nHe said digitalisation is a core component of the airlines\u2019 long term business plan and such efforts bring immediate value especially in the area of fuel efficiency.\n\n\u201cWe are looking forward to such a partnership that contributes to the airline\u2019s efforts to accelerate our sustainability target.\n\n\u201cThrough these solutions, we seek to play a greater part in building a legacy for future generations and enhancing our own airline\u2019s sustainability efforts,\u201d Ahmad Luqman said in a statement yesterday.\n\nFuel Insight is a cost and emissions monitoring solution that works by understanding data from the aircraft to uncover valuable intelligence that helps increase fuel efficiency and reduce waste.\n\nIt also gives operators actionable intelligence at multiple levels allowing analysts to drill down macro trends to understand issues on a per-flight level.\n\nThe software uses GE Digital\u2019s Event Measurement System (EMS) aviation data and analytics platform to merge flight data with flight plans, load sheets and fuel uplift data, identify the most attainable fuel savings opportunities, and track the incremental savings across the operation.\n\nFlightPulse, meanwhile, puts data directly into the hands of pilots, allowing them to visualise their savings over time.\n\nPilots who understand their own performance can adjust their flight plans to maximise safety and fuel efficiency.\n\nSecure benchmarking and data sharing allows crew members to see their contribution to projects and dramatically shortens the feedback loop.\n\nMAB evaluated the software with an extensive team of pilots, dispatchers and analysts who endorsed the software solution, which is hosted on GE Digital\u2019s EMS platform.\n\nEMS is built on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform providing compute, data, and security services.\n\nGE Digital\u2019s GM of the aviation software business Andrew Coleman said the company is committed to environmental excellence and that includes ensuring its customers are empowered to reduce the impact of their technology and environmental footprint within their operations.\n\n\u201cThese solutions will help MAB to leverage software to improve efficiency and reduce carbon emissions,\u201d Coleman added.\n\nThe solution will be implemented by the GE Digital aviation software teams in Austin, Texas and Shanghai, China.\n\nAdditionally, GE Digital provides MAB with the tools to build its big data analytics and leverage modern tools for data analysis

But fans in Malaysia have something to look forward to as two locals are working on a real-life version of the game \u2013 and this time, you can finally taste your veggies.\n\nWith the help of artificial intelligence and, in the near future, drones, Aquaville Asia hopes to become the world\u2019s first aquaponics farm where subscribers can nurture actual crops through their phones.\n\nFeeling like kale this week but kangkung the next? No problem, just tap on your screen and come harvest day, you will be greeted at your doorstep with fresh greens harvested from your own aquaponic plot.\n\nThat\u2019s the plan, at least \u2013 but for the time being, the concept is already in motion where subscribers can get five packs of vegetables delivered four times a month, with optional tilapia fish.\n\nAquaville founder Chia Weng Yan tells FMT that the idea came to him in the middle of the night. \u201cI dreamt about it and jotted down \u2018FarmVille in real life\u2019,\u201d the 40-year-old says.\n\n\u201cI created a pitch deck for it thinking it was a great idea, but didn\u2019t execute it and kept it on my computer for a long time,\u201d he adds, explaining that he struggled to find someone with the technological know-how to make his literal dream a reality.\n\nThen, in July last year, Chia found the perfect person for the job.\n\nLoke Chung Eng had posted on Facebook about robotics and projects involving IOT, or \u201cinternet of things\u201d, a network of physical objects embedded with sensors, software and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data.\n\nA phone call later and Chia had joined forces with Loke, 33, to create Aquaville Asia. The duo worked for months on the concept.\n\nWhile Loke spent time programming the AI system, Chia reached out to urban farmers, friends and family members to get them on board.\n\nThe duo forged an alliance with AHA Services Malaysia, a farm run by urban agriculturalists who provide Aquaville with all their farming requirements, including maintenance, harvest and delivery of fresh produce to subscribers.\n\nChia and Loke leave the farming to these experts and do their share by equipping the farm with Aquaville\u2019s AI technology.\n\n\u201cWe provide them with smart-farm capabilities so if any subscriptions come in, they are ready to harvest and deliver the produce,\u201d Chia explains.\n\nHe adds that using AI, Loke created a way to spot diseases in crops using an NDVI camera that scans vegetables at different wavelengths \u201cso you know if they are dying ahead of time\u201d.\n\nThe AI system can even monitor pH levels, humidity, heat and water levels. All their crops are pesticide-free.\n\nAquaville was officially launched in January this year, and subscribers have been effusive about how lush and crisp their vegetables are, compared with those bought in a store.\n\nSome customers have also funnelled their harvests to the needy, among them three companies that donated to a special-needs home in Petaling Jaya \u2013 sending bundles of fresh greens to feed 74 children between January and June \u2013 as well as contributed towards the white flag movement.\n\nIn the near future, Chia and Loke aim to introduce an application and drone system that will swoop over crops and capture real-time footage. Subscribers will be able to monitor their greens and control them through the app.\n\nAdditionally, the duo hope to empower the less fortunate and provide deaf, mute and B40 families with job opportunities on the farm.\n\nIt may take a few years for this FarmVille dream to fully become a reality, but the Aquaville innovators are hopeful and looking forward to a bright and greener future.\n\nFor fresh produce at your door each week or to help the needy, contact Aquaville Asia via Facebook or check out their website.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["taste", "malaysias", "veggies", "provide", "ai", "loke", "crops", "system", "chia", "aquaville", "farmville", "subscribers", "fresh", "vegetables"], "summary": "PETALING JAYA: Thousands were left cropless and devastated last year when Zynga\u2019s popular game FarmVille announced the end of its 11-year legacy.\nBut fans in Malaysia have something to look forward to as two locals are working on a real-life version of the game \u2013 and this time, you can finally taste your veggies.\nAquaville founder Chia Weng Yan tells FMT that the idea came to him in the middle of the night.\nWhile Loke spent time programming the AI system, Chia reached out to urban farmers, friends and family members to get them on board.\nThe AI system can even monitor pH levels, humidity, heat and water levels.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-08-12 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "1989 Proton Black Knight Wins \u201cUnexceptional\u201d Award In UK Car Festival", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL2Z1bi8yMDIxLzA4LzAzLzE5ODktcHJvdG9uLWJsYWNrLWtuaWdodC13aW5zLXVuZXhjZXB0aW9uYWwtYXdhcmQtaW4tdWstY2FyLWZlc3RpdmFsL9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL2Z1bi8yMDIxLzA4LzAzLzE5ODktcHJvdG9uLWJsYWNrLWtuaWdodC13aW5zLXVuZXhjZXB0aW9uYWwtYXdhcmQtaW4tdWstY2FyLWZlc3RpdmFsL2FtcC8?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Azizul Rahman Ismail", "Maya Suraya"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Proton-Black-Knight.jpeg", "text": "Subscribe to our new Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates.\n\nThe Proton Saga is Malaysia\u2019s first car and was the symbol of the nation\u2019s success. It says so in the jingle, if you are old enough to remember it.\n\nIntroduced in 1985, the name Saga was theorised to have a double meaning.\n\nIn English, it is defined as a long story of heroic achievement.\n\nIn Malay, it refers to the Adenanthera tree. The colour of its bright and deep red seeds was the inspiration for the signature hue of the national car.\n\nHowever, the reality is, the name \u201cSaga\u201d was the winning entry in a competition held in 1984.\n\nThe winner, Staf Sarjan Ismail Jaafar said that the name is actually an acronym for Safety, Achievement, Greatness, and Ability.\n\nThey Don\u2019t Make Them Like They Used To\n\nThe first generation Saga had many iterations and was in production up to 1992.\n\nOne of its most notable versions of the Saga was a hatchback released in 1987 during the peak of popularity of a certain TV show starring a certain modified Pontiac Trans Am.\n\nThe hatchback was called the Proton Knight. It was later named Proton Saga Aeroback, perhaps for copyright reasons.

Lots of things are being said,\u201d he said as PSG laboured to a 2-1 win over Troyes in their opening game of the new league season.\n\nJorge Sampaoli, the Argentine coach of PSG\u2019s bitter rivals Marseille, said the arrival of Messi can only be good news for French football.\n\n\u201cIt would be great for Ligue 1, he\u2019s the best player in the world,\u201d said Sampaoli.\n\n\u201cFrench football has won a lot and grown a lot in recent seasons.\n\n\u201cEven if he goes to a club other than Marseille, it will be good.

year\u2019s Merdeka will be like no other, courtesy of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nWith most of the Klang Valley and other urban centres under strict lockdown, the usual display of patriotic sentiments will be somewhat drowned out by the pervasive gloom of the moment.\n\nYet, 27 artists have chosen to express their love for the country during the month of Merdeka by displaying their works in an online exhibition titled very simply \u201cJalur Gemilang\u201d.\n\nOpen for viewing until the end of the month, the exhibition is hosted by Artas Galeri, an art gallery based in Petaling Jaya.\n\nAccording to Roy Ng, Artas Galeri\u2019s director, plans were already underway to hold a physical Merdeka-themed exhibition in the months leading up to August.\n\nHowever, with the extension of MCO 3.0, it became painfully clear that Plan B would have to be executed.\n\n\u201cDue to the pandemic and the increasing number of cases, I decided to launch an online show with an e-catalogue instead,\u201d he said.\n\nThat way, art enthusiasts will still be able to view the art pieces themselves without leaving the safety of their homes.\n\n\u201cMost of these artists\u2019 works exhibited in the \u2018Jalur Gemilang\u2019 exhibition are based on our national flag\u2019s colours,\u201d Ng said, adding that a majority of them used copious amounts of red, yellow, blue and white in multiple art styles including abstract, still-life and figurative.\n\nAccording to him, the artists are a fascinating group made up of graduates fresh out of art school as well as senior artists who have made a name for themselves in the art world.\n\nFMT had the pleasure of interviewing six of the artists regarding their hopes for the country this Merdeka month.\n\nYuki Lim Xiao Mun, artist of the almost ethereal \u201cThe Paradise Land\u201d, had this to say: \u201cMy hope for this Merdeka month is that our country can be restored to good condition after the economic hardship caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nShe said it was also her sincere hope that Malaysia\u2019s leaders will lead the country down the right path by practising integrity in their leadership.\n\nLikewise, Fadzril Fakaruddin encouraged Malaysians to stay united no matter what the circumstances, so that together, they could be free of Covid-19 for good.\n\nWhile Hamir Soib hopes for better governance, fellow artist Najib Ahmad Bamadhaj is hopeful for a return to normalcy and the good \u2018ol pre-Covid days.\n\nNational unity is something that veteran artist, Awang Damit, believes is vital if the country is to survive these difficult times.\n\nAnd another artist, Zulkefli Talha, reminded Malaysians to love each other as fellow countrymen regardless of racial or religious differences.\n\n\u201cLeaders have to be good examples for the people. And both leaders and the people have to work together to end this pandemic and return Malaysia to its former glory.\u201d\n\nNg told FMT that the pandemic had been especially tough on many artists. The numerous lockdowns this past year and a half meant potential buyers were unable to view the artworks personally and as a consequence, there was little to no sales.\n\nHe said there was an urgent need for artists to find alternative avenues to display their work so that they could continue to earn a decent living.\n\nNg explained that things have not been looking up for artists for a while now. Prior to the pandemic, the sluggish economy meant artists struggled to make a sale. The lockdowns brought about by the pandemic, only made things worse.\n\n\u201cMost collectors and buyers prefer to see the pieces in person. There\u2019s a huge difference between seeing artworks personally and virtually,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen you view an artwork physically, you will be able to see the texture, notice the colour tones and spot the little details. That\u2019s something these virtual exhibitions sadly cannot offer.\u201d\n\nHowever, this has not dampened the spirit of art collectors such as Brendan Siva in regard to the \u201cJalur Gemilang\u201d exhibition.\n\n\u201cEach piece is unique as an individual interpretation and expression of what Malaysia represents and symbolises in the eyes of the artist.

So it\u2019s just like dance.\u201d\n\nEach scene will be discussed and rehearsed beforehand, away from the glare of the dozens of people usually present on a set.\n\n\u201cWhen the camera rolls or they\u2019re up on stage, they know they can perform that intimate contact, knowing where they\u2019re going to be touched,\u201d she says.\n\nAt the heart of her philosophy is consent, in an industry which has been rocked in recent years by sexual assault claims. Her motto, which she says she often repeats to actors, is: \u201cYour \u2018no\u2019 is a gift. Tell us your \u2018no\u2019, so that we can trust your \u2018yes'\u201d.\n\n\u2018Incredibly hard\u2019\n\nO\u2019Brien was a dancer in the theatre for 10 years and then an actress for eight before she sensed an opportunity and became an intimacy coordinator in 2014.\n\nIt was a pioneering move at a time when actors\u2019 consent was little talked about, and before the #MeToo movement against sexual abuse and sexual harassment.\n\nBefore then, \u201cif an actor ever said \u2018no\u2019, they\u2019d be a troublemaker or a diva, and they would certainly be worried about losing their job,\u201d she recalls.\n\nIn such an environment, she describes her early days in the role as \u201cincredibly hard\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had productions where I\u2019ve been told not to speak to the director,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m serving the director\u2019s vision, but the director doesn\u2019t want to speak to me because he\u2019s a 74-year-old man, who basically doesn\u2019t want to acknowledge my existence.\u201d\n\nOn other occasions, she was not allowed on the set because the actors or director did not want her help.\n\nAttitudes have since changed a lot. The profession is becoming more popular and O\u2019Brien is in high demand, especially after Michaela Coel dedicated her best actress BAFTA win this year for \u201cI May Destroy You\u201d to her.\n\n\u201cThank you, Ita, for making a space safe, for creating physical, emotional and professional boundaries, so we can make work about exploitation, loss of respect, about abuse of powers, without being exploited or abused in the process,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["stars", "sexual", "ita", "obrien", "indemand", "intimacy", "process", "coordinator", "scenes", "sex", "actor",

Covid jabs per day and are moving towards increasing to 20,000 doses per day. \u2014 Picture by Sayuti Zainudin\n\nFollow us on Instagram and subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates.\n\nGEORGE TOWN, Aug 1 \u2014 Factories and small businesses in Penang, especially those hard hit by disruptions due to the Covid-19 pandemic, are looking forward to resuming operations as soon as possible even if it means making vaccination mandatory for their workers.\n\nAs there are currently no laws to enforce mandatory Covid-19 vaccination on workers, some companies are taking steps to get their workers to register for vaccination.\n\nPenang Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM) chairman Datuk Jimmy Ong said most factories here are encouraging their workers to register for their Covid jabs through various methods.\n\n\u201cSome companies are giving paid leave to their workers to go for vaccination and some are even offering monetary rewards,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the main reason multinational companies (MNC) are setting up Program Imunisasi Industri Covid-19 Kerjasama Awam-Swasta (Pikas) vaccination centres within their own factory grounds is to encourage their workers to get vaccinated.\n\nHe said the Pikas PPVs in Penang are now dispensing 15,000 doses per day and are moving towards increasing to 20,000 doses per day.\n\nHe said the vaccination of workers in MNCs is progressing very fast due to the on-site PPVs for larger factories which employ thousands of workers.\n\n\u201cIt is slower for small medium enterprises as they can only send their workers to the Pikas PPVs and there are only two of those now; one in Jawi and one at Equatorial Hotel,\u201d he said.\n\nEven with vaccination in full force, Ong said some of the companies in the manufacturing sector have continued to conduct screening of workers every two to three weeks.\n\n\u201cScreening still has to continue to control any potential spread of cases within the factories because we know, even those vaccinated still have a risk of contracting Covid-19,\u201d he said.\n\nFMM Penang branch offers a Penang SAFE programme for factories to conduct screening tests for its workers at a lower rate of RM60 per person.\n\nOng said the programme recommends that any company taking up the package conduct screening of 100 per cent of its staff in the first round.\n\n\u201cAfter that, they can conduct screening on 20 per cent of their staff for the second round and another 20 per cent on the third round, and so on,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, one of the SMEs in Penang, Chemdyes Sdn Bhd, has checked labour laws on ways to compel its employees to get vaccinated.\n\nThe company\u2019s managing director Joe Sidek said it was informed that there are at present no laws for the company to compel its employees to register for vaccination.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t legally force them to register for vaccination, it is a personal right, so what we do is to encourage them to do it as a way to safeguard everyone\u2019s safety in the workplace,\u201d he said.\n\nThe factory, specialising in textile chemicals, has about 22 workers and Joe said all have registered for vaccination.\n\nA nurse administers a dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at the Pikas vaccination centre at the Bukit Jawi Golf Resort in Penang June 17, 2021. \u2014 Picture by Sayuti Zainudin\n\nHe said despite the downturn in the textile industry due to the pandemic, Chemdyes recorded stable revenue last year and expects an increase in revenue this year.\n\n\u201cWe have kept all our staff and did not cut any pay so we have been very fortunate and we want to ensure that everyone is safe, we do not want to have any cases that could disrupt production,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said he would allow his workers to stay home for a week and to undergo screening tests if they have been exposed to places with a high number of Covid-19 cases.\n\nMeanwhile, it was reported that the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) is considering making vaccination of all employees in the retail sector one of the pre-conditions for approval for companies to resume operation, during the National Recovery Plan (NRP) period.\n\nYin\u2019s Sourdough Bakery and cafe co-founder Ong Seng Keat has already made it compulsory for all of its 40 workers to sign up for vaccination.\n\n\u201cWe will check our workers\u2019 MySejahtera to make sure they have registered and if we have to pay for it, we will,\u201d he said.\n\nHis company has already paid for all of his workers in Klang Valley to be vaccinated under a retail industry vaccination programme.\n\nHe hopes such programmes will be available in Penang so he can send all his workers to be vaccinated as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cThe government really needs to speed up its vaccination programme for the economic frontliners because we deal with people every day,\u201d he said.\n\nMugshot Cafe co-founder Jesse Tan agrees with Ong that vaccination for economic frontliners should be sped up.\n\n\u201cSo far, all of our staff have registered for vaccination but they are still waiting for their appointments,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of Mugshot\u2019s staff contracted Covid-19 a few months back due to close contact with a relative but fortunately, it did not spread to the other staff in the cafe.\n\n\u201cThere are 15 of us in the cafe and all of us went for screening the moment we found out he was positive but luckily, we were all negative,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the incident further emphasises the importance of vaccination for all workers who deal with customers daily.\n\nAs for Hin Bus Depot manager Tan Shih Thoe, he is also considering only allowing fully vaccinated vendors to participate in the Hin Bus Depot weekly bazaar, when they are finally allowed to reopen.\n\n\u201cI was just thinking about this, especially for the market, whether I should only allow vendors who are fully vaccinated to participate... main consideration is their safety since the market is considered a crowded space,\u201d he said.\n\nThere used to be 70 vendors at the weekly market before the pandemic but due to standard operating procedures (SOPs), the number of vendors came down to around 55 each week.\n\nThe market has been closed for more than two months due to the movement control order (MCO) and subsequent phases of the NRP.\n\nHin Bus Depot has around 15 tenants, consisting of eateries and artisans, and Tan said he will also strongly encourage the tenants and their workers to register for vaccination.\n\n\u201cMost of them are in favour of vaccination as they see it as the only solution to things getting back to normal,\u201d he said.\n\nFurry Kids pet shop owner Dalbinder Singh also agrees that it is important for those in the retail sector to be vaccinated.\n\n\u201cWe are meeting people and customers daily so it is important for the safety of everyone,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, he said it would be infringing on the individual\u2019s human rights to force workers to register for vaccination so he can only encourage them to do so.\n\n\u201cFortunately, all of my staff have registered but they are still waiting... I am also still waiting for my appointment,\u201d he said.\n\nHe too said vaccination for retail workers should be sped up since they face customers daily.", "keyword": ["register", "vaccination", "manufacturing", "ong", "pikas", "workers", "services", "support", "staff", "sectors", "employers", "screening", "mandate", "covid19", "vaccinated", "penang", "vaccine"], "summary": "As there are currently no laws to enforce mandatory Covid-19 vaccination on workers, some companies are taking steps to get their workers to register for vaccination.\nPenang Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM) chairman Datuk Jimmy Ong said most factories here are encouraging their workers to register for their Covid jabs through various methods.\nHe said the vaccination of workers in MNCs is progressing very fast due to the on-site PPVs for larger factories which employ thousands of workers.\nFMM Penang branch offers a Penang SAFE programme for factories to conduct screening tests for its workers at a lower rate of RM60 per person.\nA nurse administers a dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at the Pikas vaccination centre at the Bukit Jawi Golf Resort in Penang June 17, 2021.", "news": "Malay Mail", "date": "2021-08-01 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Can employers make COVID-19 vaccinations mandatory for all staff?

Here\u2019s what you need to know:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Can employers make vaccination compulsory for employees?\n\nEmployment lawyer Donovan Cheah said there is no law now that disallows mandatory vaccination policies by employers, and that there are no known court cases in the country about whether such a policy would be legal.\n\n\u201cGiven the severity of the pandemic, having a mandatory vaccination policy is one of the ways for employers to safeguard the safety and health of their employees and curb the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cHowever, there are no reported court cases in Malaysia about the legality of mandatory vaccination policies, and whether an employer can take disciplinary action against an employee for refusing to vaccinate,\u201d he said, but noted there have been reported cases in countries like Australia and the US which upheld the dismissal of employees who refuse to comply with their employer\u2019s mandatory vaccination policy.\n\nSpecialist employment lawyer Marcus van Geyzel said employers would generally be able to make it compulsory for their employees to undergo COVID-19 vaccination if this is due to a government-imposed requirement.\n\n\u201cYes, if the MDTCA/KPDNHEP makes employee vaccinations mandatory or a pre-condition for approval to operate, the affected employers can impose this requirement on employees,\u201d he told Malay Mail.\n\n\u201cHowever, employers should be cautious where there are special circumstances, such as where an employee is unable to receive a vaccination due to a medical condition,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIn general, it would be very unlikely for an employee to successfully challenge an employer\u2019s mandatory vaccination policy where vaccinations have been declared a pre-condition for operations by the government.\n\nIn order to bring a successful legal action, an employee would have to show that in mandating vaccination, the employer has exercised its managerial power in a non-genuine manner, or that there was victimisation or an unfair labour practice,\u201d he said.\n\n2. What if the employees say no to vaccination?\n\nCheah said employers can choose to take disciplinary action against employees who refuse vaccination, and that whether such action is reasonable depends on the situation.\n\n\u201cWhile an employer cannot physically compel an employee to take the vaccine, an employee\u2019s freedom of choice is not the same thing as freedom from consequences. There are no legal prohibitions against an employer implementing a mandatory vaccination policy, although how employers deal with breaches of this policy may be evaluated by the courts,\u201d he said.\n\nCheah said disciplinary action including dismissal may be seen as reasonable, taking into account various factors.\n\nHe listed examples such as the employee\u2019s reason for refusal; whether the employee\u2019s refusal amounts to a breach of their duties or has caused loss or damage to the company or other employees; whether the employee\u2019s job function requires him/her to have regular and frequent physical interaction with third parties.\n\nOther factors listed by Cheah are the current severity of the pandemic; whether the employer\u2019s business deals with high-risk individuals; and whether vaccination is a pre-condition from the authorities for the employer to operate.\n\n\u201cWhere an employee has a legitimate reason to refuse vaccination (eg: health condition), employers should explore other ways to address the risk, such as requiring them to carry out their duties remotely and not allowing them to enter the premises without notice,\u201d Cheah added.\n\nVan Geyzel said employers would have several options, when vaccinations are a precondition for operations but there are employees who refuse to get vaccinated.\n\nThese options are to engage with the employees, or to transfer employees to alternative roles, or to ultimately stop employing the employee.\n\n\u201cThe first step should always be for employers to have clear and open conversations with these employees to ensure that they understand the reason for the vaccination requirement.\n\n\u201cEmployers can also consider redesignating or redeploying the affected employees to other roles within the business which are not customer-facing and which may be exempted from the regulatory requirements,\u201d he said.\n\nIf redesignation and redeployment is not an option, employers would be legally able to terminate the employee\u2019s employment if it is reasonable in the circumstances, he said.\n\nVan Geyzel said there is a general legal expectation that an employee has to follow all lawful and reasonable instructions by the employer.\n\nHe added that it can be argued that an employee is carrying out an act of insubordination by refusing to be vaccinated under the circumstances, as the employee is wilfully disobeying a lawful and reasonable order issued by the employer.\n\n\u201cAny punishment or action by the employer in response to insubordination has to be reasonable or proportionate, and it can be said here that where the result of the employee\u2019s vaccination is that the business would not be allowed to operate, there are serious repercussions and therefore termination of employment is a reasonable response by the employer.\n\n\u201cAnother potential justification for termination of employment is that an unvaccinated employee would be unable to perform the job or service for which the employee was employed. This would be the case if an unvaccinated employee is not permitted by law to work.\n\n\u201cIn such a situation, it may be reasonable for an employer to deem that the employment contract cannot be performed and therefore can be terminated,\u201d he said.\n\n3. What if an employee says no to vaccination due to health conditions?\n\nAs for employees who are unable to receive COVID-19 vaccinations due to a medical condition, van Geyzel said employers could explore measures such as redesignation.\n\n\u201cFirstly, I don\u2019t think the government would make vaccinations mandatory for such employees.\n\n\u201cSecondly, even if the government issued a blanket requirement, the employer should see if it\u2019s possible to apply for an exemption for that employee, or again see if redeployment or redesignation is an option.\n\n\u201cTermination should always be a last resort, but if the employer has acted reasonably, then termination should be possible under the law,\u201d he said, also saying that an employee would be unlikely to succeed in an unfair dismissal claim if an employer treated the employee fairly and could show that the termination was reasonable in the circumstances.\n\nFor employees with pre-existing health conditions that prevent them from being vaccinated, employment lawyer Jayasingam Poopalasingam said employers can seek to take mitigation measures such as changing their work roles or have them work remotely.\n\nHowever, if the nature of the business and nature of the employee\u2019s work requires vaccination, but vaccination is not possible due to the health condition and mitigating measures are not feasible through no fault of both the employer or the employee, the employer may be left with no choice but to terminate employment.\n\nThe employee could under such circumstances file a complaint to claim that the dismissal was without just cause and excuse, but it would ultimately be for the Industrial Court to decide if the dismissal was with just cause and excuse, he said.\n\n4. Putting it into the employment contract and putting it in writing\n\nJayasingam, who is also co-chair of the Bar Council\u2019s Industrial and Employment Law Committee, similarly said there are currently no laws that mandate COVID-19 vaccination for employees.\n\nThis means that for existing employees, an employer cannot \u201cforce\u201d them to be vaccinated, but can only seek to persuade and convince the employee of the need to be vaccinated due to reasons such as the nature of the work.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing much you can do, you cannot force the employee to go for vaccination, you cannot force an employee to undergo a medical procedure, it has to be by way of consent,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf they are existing employees, it must be by way of consent. They have a right to refuse vaccination, that\u2019s why we advise employers to obtain the written consent of employees to be vaccinated,\u201d he said, explaining that a mere verbal consent is not advisable as an employee could later claim to have never given consent.\n\nFor employees who pose a high risk due to the nature of their job as a frontliner or being in contact with others but refuse vaccination, employers can transfer them to another position where they do not deal with customers or other employees, he said.\n\nBut for new employees, an employer can make being vaccinated against COVID-19 a part of the employment contract prior to them joining the company, he said.\n\n\u201cYou cannot force it but what you can do is if you are having new employees, you can put it as a term of the contract, where they must be vaccinated before they are hired for employment, or they must undertake they will be vaccinated after they join you,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the new recruit would have the option of not joining the company upon viewing the contract, while employers can terminate employment if the new hire subsequently does not comply with instructions to be vaccinated as promised under the contract.\n\n5. About legal action\n\nIf an employer forces an employee to undergo COVID-19 vaccination, the employee can possibly walk out of the job and try to claim \u201cconstructive dismissal\u201d, Jayasingam said.\n\nIn cases of constructive dismissal claims, the employer does not have to issue a letter of termination, but the employee is essentially claiming that the employer has done something in breach of his contractual rights and that the employer\u2019s conduct had resulted in the employee\u2019s resignation.\n\nSuch an employee could then seek to prove their case in the Industrial Court to claim for monetary compensation and reinstatement to the job with all previous benefits and rights unaffected, including the right to not be forced to be vaccinated, Jayasingam said. It would ultimately be for the Industrial Court to decide if there was constructive dismissal.\n\nAlternatively, employees can also file a claim in civil courts but this is usually not preferred as the compensation is very small, with most employees likely to go to the Industrial Court instead, he said.\n\nUnlike new employees who have agreed to being vaccinated under the employment contract and can be terminated for non-compliance, Jayasingam said employers could face labour complaints by existing employees if the latter are terminated over their non-vaccinated status.\n\n\u201cIf the employer terminates them for not being vaccinated, the employee can file a complaint of dismissal without just cause and excuse,\u201d he said, explaining the process as involving employees filing complaints with the Industrial Relations Department under the Human Resources Ministry within 60 days of dismissal to see whether it could be resolved amicably, with the matter to be referred by the department director-general to the Industrial Court if it cannot be resolved.\n\nBut in situations where it is a government requirement for staff to be vaccinated in order to operate, an employer may have reason to terminate an employee who refuses to get vaccinated if it affects the business, Jayasingam said.\n\n\u201cSo the employer may have just cause and excuse to terminate the employee because he cannot carry on business,\u201d he said.\n\nJayasingam gave a hypothetical example, where an employee who works as a carer at a nursing home refuses to be vaccinated when it is a government requirement for such work, and the carer may as a result pose a risk to the elderly persons at the nursing home.\n\nIn such a situation and where there are no mitigation measures possible, the employer \u2014 who is unable to force the employee to be vaccinated \u2014 may opt to terminate the employee as it affects the business or may result in the nursing home having to be closed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s for the Industrial Court to decide whether what the employer did was reasonable or not,\u201d he said.\n\n6. Can the government make COVID-19 vaccination mandatory for employees?\n\nVan Geyzel said there may be a stronger basis for a compulsory vaccination requirement by the government for certain industries.\n\n\u201cThe laws that have been passed in response to the pandemic grant the government very broad powers to impose SOPs or pre-conditions for businesses to operate, and when it comes to roles or industries that have clear and frequent face-to-face contact and interaction with the general public, there is a stronger justification for the authorities to impose mandatory vaccination requirements. This is especially so as vaccinations are widely available and accessible.\n\n\u201cHowever, if the government overreaches and tries to impose mandatory vaccinations on other roles or industries where there is no clear face-to-face interaction or risk, I could see this being open to legal challenge,\u201d he said.\n\nJayasingam said the government could impose mandatory vaccinations on the general population including employees by passing an Act in Parliament, but believes that implementing such a policy of forcing vaccinations would only be a \u201clast resort.\u201d \u2014 Malay Mail", "keyword": ["vaccination", "employee", "employer", "say", "staff", "heres", "employers", "lawyers", "employees", "employment", "mandatory", "covid19", "vaccinated", "reasonable", "vaccinations"], "summary": "\u201cYes, if the MDTCA/KPDNHEP makes employee vaccinations mandatory or a pre-condition for approval to operate, the affected employers can impose this requirement on employees,\u201d he told Malay Mail.\n\u201cIn general, it would be very unlikely for an employee to successfully challenge an employer\u2019s mandatory vaccination policy where vaccinations have been declared a pre-condition for operations by the government.\n\u201cFirstly, I don\u2019t think the government would make vaccinations mandatory for such employees.\nCan the government make COVID-19 vaccination mandatory for employees?\n\u201cHowever, if the government overreaches and tries to impose mandatory vaccinations on other roles or industries where there is no clear face-to-face interaction or risk, I could see this being open to legal challenge,\u201d he said.", "news": "SoyaCincau.com", "date": "2021-08-02 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Ministry mulls proposal to control price of Covid-19 test kit", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbGF5bWFpbC5jb20vbmV3cy9tYWxheXNpYS8yMDIxLzA4LzAzL21pbmlzdHJ5LW11bGxzLXByb3Bvc2FsLXRvLWNvbnRyb2wtcHJpY2Utb2YtY292aWQtMTktdGVzdC1raXQvMTk5NDkwMtIBfGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbGF5bWFpbC5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wOC8wMy9taW5pc3RyeS1tdWxscy1wcm9wb3NhbC10by1jb250cm9sLXByaWNlLW9mLWNvdmlkLTE5LXRlc3Qta2l0LzE5OTQ5MDI?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://media2.malaymail.com/resize_cache/uploads/articles/2021/2021-07/covid_test_kit2_26072021-seo.jpg", "text": "Deputy Minister Datuk Rosol Wahid said based on feedback from the public, the test kit price is a burden especially to the low-income groups and families with many children. \u2014 Bernama pic\n\nFollow us on Instagram and subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates.\n\nKUALA BERANG, Aug 3 \u2015 The Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) is considering a proposal to control the price of the Covid-19 test kit, said Deputy Minister Datuk Rosol Wahid.\n\nHe said based on feedback from the public, the test kit price is a burden especially to the low-income groups and families with many children.\n\n\u201cWe were told that the price is RM39.90 each, not many can afford to buy it at that price.

Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on household income and made more people poorer, according to a study conducted by the Department of Statistics.\n\nThe Covid-19 impact study on household income in Malaysia for 2020 revealed that the number of poor households increased to 639,800 in 2020, up from 405,400 in 2019.\n\nThe findings of the study are contained in the Household Income Estimates and Incidence of Poverty Report, Malaysia, 2020 which the department released today.\n\nChief Statistician Datuk Seri Dr Mohd Uzir Mahidin said in a statement that the incidence of absolute poverty also increased, from 5.6 per cent in 2019 to 8.4 per cent in 2020, and that the incidence of hardcore poverty is estimated to increase from 0.4 per cent (2019) involving 27,200 households to 1.0 per cent involving 78,000 households.\n\nHe said the pandemic had also affected the structure of household groups, with 20 per cent of households from the M40 group with income between RM4,850 and RM10,959 having moved to the B40 group.\n\n\u201cHouseholds in the T20 group were also affected by the Covid-19 pandemic where 12.8 per cent of this group has shifted to the M40 group,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also said that as the percentage decrease in income for B40 and M40 households was larger than the T20 households group, the income distribution for B40 and M40 declined to 15.9 per cent (2019: 16.0 per cent) and 36.9 per cent (2019: 37.2 per cent), respectively.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the T20 group owned 47.2 per cent of income increased by 0.4 percentage points from 2019,\u201d he added.\n\nMohd Uzir said the mean of monthly household gross income decreased by negative 10.3 per cent to record RM7,089 as compared to RM7,901 in 2019 and added that the decline was contributed by households or individuals who experienced loss or reduction of income, particularly those with the status of employee, self-employed and others.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, this reduction of income was not only caused by job loss but also contributed by the reduction of working hours and increase in skill-related underemployment,\u201d he said.\n\nMohd Uzir said that all territories/states recorded a decline in mean and median of monthly household gross income. The Federal Territory of Putrajaya registered the lowest reduction in monthly household income and remained to record the highest mean and median of monthly household gross income as compared to other territories/states with RM12,322 and RM9,743, respectively.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, Kelantan remained to record the lowest mean and median income with RM4,411 and RM3,010, respectively,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also said that the incidence of absolute poverty by state shows that Sabah recorded the highest percentage of 25.3 per cent (2019: 19.5 per cent) while Kelantan recorded a significant increase in poverty by 8.8 percentage points to 21.2 per cent from 12.4 per cent (2019), followed by Terengganu by 5.9 percentage points to 12 per cent from 6.1 per cent (2019).\n\nMohd Uzir said the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic may be temporary as the economy is expected to improve and recover as the spread of the pandemic can be contained.\n\n\u201cFrom this analysis, it is found that the role of the federal and state governments as well as other relevant parties is pertinent in cushioning the impact of the pandemic as well as towards reviving the household income and the country\u2019s economy,\u201d he said.- Bernama", "keyword": ["study", "households", "poverty", "2019", "income", "household", "cent", "covid19", "uzir", "impact", "pandemic", "reveals", "percentage", "group", "significant"], "summary": "KUALA LUMPUR: The Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on household income and made more people poorer, according to a study conducted by the Department of Statistics.\nThe Covid-19 impact study on household income in Malaysia for 2020 revealed that the number of poor households increased to 639,800 in 2020, up from 405,400 in 2019.\nThe findings of the study are contained in the Household Income Estimates and Incidence of Poverty Report, Malaysia, 2020 which the department released today.\nMohd Uzir said that all territories/states recorded a decline in mean and median of monthly household gross income.\nThe Federal Territory of Putrajaya registered the lowest reduction in monthly household income and remained to record the highest mean and median of monthly household gross income as compared to other territories/states with RM12,322 and RM9,743, respectively.", "news": "The Sun Daily", "date": "2021-08-06 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Not so slick: Domestic Trade Ministry foils attempt to misappropriate 18,000kg of cooking oil", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEEHgxPt-i917aEqtS9q5XVIqGQgEKhAIACoHCAow-N7eCjC60NYBMLfbhwM?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Santhakumar A L"], "top-image": "https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2021/08/11/1252988.jpg", "text": "SHAH ALAM (Bernama): The Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry has foiled an attempt to misappropriate 18,000kg of cooking oil, 8,775 kg of which were subsidised 1kg packets.\n\nThe ministry's Selangor director Muhammad Zikril Azan Abdullah said raids carried out on two stores in Puchong found that the embezzlement activity was done by cutting the 1kg packets of subsidised cooking oil and transferring them to a skid tank to be bottled as 2kg and 5kg and sold for higher prices.\n\nHe said four locals and a foreigner, suspected to be an Indonesian, between the age of 30 and 50, identified as the owners of the premises were arrested to assist in the investigation.\n\nHe added that two lorries, a skid tank, forklift, cut 1kg plastic packets and bottles of cooking oil used to make the transfer were confiscated.

earnings in the second half of the financial year 2021 (2H21), underpinned by higher exports volume and refining margins.\n\nCGS-CIMB Securities Sdn Bhd analysts Nagulan Ravi and Ivy Ng Lee Fang, in a research report, stated that MSM have rightly hedged 99% of its financial year 2021 forecast (FY21F) domestic wholesale raw sugar requirement at US$0.13 (RM0.55) to US$0.14 per pounds (lbs) and 43% of its FY22F requirement at US$0.15-0.16/lbs.\n\nLast year\u2019s raw sugar price averaged at US$0.13-0.14/lbs.\n\n\u201cThis bodes well for MSM given raw sugar prices have been trending higher over the past 18 months to US$0.185/lbs currently, due to supply disruptions in Brazil and Thailand,\u201d the analysts stated in the report yesterday, following a recent update from the company\u2019s management.\n\nThe analysts stated that MSM expects a 10% year-on-year (YoY) growth in its domestic sales volumes in FY21F and has raised its average selling prices (ASPs) for both the wholesale (up to the maximum ceiling price of RM2.69 per kg) and industry segments.\n\nThe higher ASPs and sales volumes would help boost MSM\u2019s domestic refining margins in 2H21F, they added.\n\nRavi and Ng further stated that MSM had secured export contracts worth 65% to 70% of its original 300,000MT export sales target for FY21F.\n\n\u201cThe group is now optimistic of delivering close to 350,000MT of export sales in FY21F, in line with our forecast of 340,000MT, which is a 25% YoY growth versus FY20,\u201d Ravi and Ng added.\n\nThey said the higher export volumes would be driven by stronger demand from its largest export destination, Vietnam, which accounts for around 50% of its exports, and other countries that have reopened from Covid-19 restrictions.\n\nIncreased demand for its value-added products such as liquid sugar, fine syrup and premix products could increase volumes.\n\nThe analysts viewed exports growth would lower refining costs at the group\u2019s refinery in Johor.\n\n\u201cPost the optimisation of its Johor refinery, MSM expects to achieve a 50% utilisation factor (UF) for its Johor refinery in 2H21.\n\n\u201cWe project the Johor refinery could return to the black in FY22F as we project a 52% UF for the year, driven by higher exports volumes,\u201d Ravi and Ng added.\n\nCGS-CIMB forecast MSM to deliver Ebitda margins of 10.9% to 12.4% in FY21-23F, led by higher domestic and export margins and more robust export volumes.\n\n\u201cWe raise our FY21-23F earnings per share forecast by 1.5% to 6.9% to reflect lower refining costs and higher export premiums.\n\n\u201cIn light of this, we raise our target price (TP) to RM1.69 based on a price/net tangible asset (P/ NTA) of 1.2 times (one standard deviation below MSM\u2019s 10-year average P/NTA) versus one time previously,\u201d the analysts wrote.\n\nThe brokerage firm also upgraded MSM to \u2018Add\u2019 as the stock offers a 25% upside to its TP and attractive dividend yields of 6.1% to 7.5% in FY21-23F.\n\nFurther key catalysts include potential equity placements to collaborative partners and the completion of the sale of MSM Perlis, which will allow the MSM group to book a one-off

integrated nature of the Asean\u2019s supply chain, the impact from Vietnam\u2019s Covid-19 woes which culminated in the extension of lockdown measures under the government\u2019s Directive 16 in various provinces in the south are felt by Malaysian businesses that have a presence there.\n\nThe directive stipulates the closure of non-essential businesses, ban on public gatherings and severely limited transport services, in an attempt to contain the wave of Covid Delta variant infections.\n\nIn the past, Vietnam enjoyed success in containing the pandemic attributed to prompt border closure and lockdown measures, as well as an extensive testing and contact tracing strategy.\n\nVietnam recorded 8,324 new Covid-19 cases on Friday, according to the country\u2019s Ministry of Health. The new infections brought the total tally to 193,381, with 3,016 deaths, the ministry said.\n\nCurrently, 19 southern localities in the country, including Ho Chi Minh City, have implemented a lockdown via Directive 16 until Aug 16.

It is assessing the impact of the closure on its financial performance and announcements will be made if there is any material development.\n\nPoh Huat Resources Holdings Bhd\n\nThe group\u2019s subsidiary, Poh Huat Furniture Industries Vietnam Joint Stock Co, which has factories in Binh Duong Province and Dong Nai Province, has halted production activities in line with the lockdown order. As of July 21, it said none of its employees in the two locations has exhibited any Covid-19 symptoms and it will undertake screening and quarantine measures should any employee exhibit symptoms or be confirmed positive of the virus.\n\nConsequently, the production interruption is expected to cause delay in the shipment of orders to its customers in the US. Poh Huat\u2019s management is in discussions with affected customers to reschedule their delivery dates for affected orders.

These criteria must be publicised so that any future decisions will be solely based on evidence,\u201d MHC explained.\n\nAdditionally, the coalition said the government should clarify the specifics of these relaxed restrictions, because blanket vaccine privileges will create loopholes that will impede NRP.\n\n\u201cFor example, the government must answer questions like: What is the rationale to allow home quarantine for vaccinated travellers, how long is the quarantine and how will we monitor? How do we close the loopholes that may allow \u2018inter-state vacations on the pretext of visiting our children?\u2019\u201d it said.\n\nMeanwhile, Malaysian Medical Association (MMA) president Datuk Dr Subramaniam Muniandy said the decision to relax restrictions must be supported with sufficient scientific evidence.\n\n\u201cIf it is indeed a decision based on science, why then is travel allowed for those wishing to see their spouse or their young children? Either it\u2019s sufficiently safe for the fully vaccinated to travel, in which case all vaccinated individuals should be allowed to do so, or it is not, in which nobody should travel,\u201d he said.\n\nHe noted that some of those states in Phase 2 are showing an increasing trend in Covid-19 cases.\n\n\u201cThe government should stop its hyping up on the total number of cases. What is important are hospital bed utilisation and the intensive care units (ICUs) situation in the country,\u201d Dr Subramaniam said.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, we hope that the government will provide an update on the positivity rate and the status of bed utilisation and ICUs in each state as these will be more meaningful indicators apart from the daily new cases. It is important that the public be kept informed of the bed capacity and ICUs status in their respective state,\u201d he added.\n\nMMA also said that the lifting of restrictions must also take into

skin and hair.\n\nETX Daily Up is focussing on a few that should help convince you to either concoct your own treatments, or embrace some of the numerous cosmetic formulations based on this precious ingredient.\n\nCaffeine, an active ingredient that shouldn\u2019t be ignored\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon to find cosmetics formulated with caffeine, an active ingredient known for its slimming and firming benefits.\n\nGenerally, it is found in creams, gels, and other beauty products designed to help lose a few centimetres on the hips, thighs, or buttocks, as well as in anti-cellulite products or formulations designed to help users improve toning or firmness.\n\nBut caffeine is also present in certain facial care products, again with the aim of fighting skin slackening, but also \u2013 and above all \u2013 to improve the appearance of the eye contour area and reduce puffiness and dark circles (it can be even more effective if the product has spent some time in the refrigerator).\n\nCreams, gels, masks, cleansers: caffeine is nowadays found in products at all price points in the cosmetic departments of department stores and specialised shops.\n\nIn the form of powder and grounds\n\nWith the advent of DIY beauty, coffee now shows up in many so-called \u201chomemade\u201d recipes in the form of powder or grounds.\n\nRich in caffeine, these formulations can offer the advantages mentioned above, but are also powerful antioxidants, which allows them to fight against certain effects seen on mature skins, and more generally against skin aging.\n\nIn addition to these inherent virtues, coffee grounds, thanks to their specific texture, also make for a great exfoliant for sloughing off dead cells.\n\nAll you need to do is mix it with other ingredients: egg white for a mask, vegetable oil and honey for a face and body scrub, or even on its own to exfoliate scalp and hair to make it shinier.\n\nOver on TikTok, known for being the go-to social network for DIY beauty recipes, one can also discover a multitude of recipes for masks and scrubs made from soluble coffee or coffee beans.\n\nRecipes that users seem to have not only tested but also

collaborating with GE Digital on aircraft fuel efficiency monitoring solutions as part of the carrier\u2019s initiatives to meet its sustainability goals.\n\nThe national flag carrier adopted GE Digital\u2019s Fuel Insight and FlightPulse aviation software to transform and modernise the airline\u2019s fuel efficiency programme.\n\nMAB has implemented various initiatives including efficiency measures, investments in sustainability solutions and waste reduction across its operations to address its sustainability goals.\n\nThe fuel efficiency programme has been running for over a decade, contributing to a 15% fuel burn improvement recorded over the past eight years.\n\nMAB\u2019s group operations officer, Ahmad Luqman Mohd Azmi, stated promoting sustainability in all of the MAB\u2019s operations has always been a top priority.\n\nHe said digitalisation is a core component of the airlines\u2019 long term business plan and such efforts bring immediate value especially in the area of fuel efficiency.\n\n\u201cWe are looking forward to such a partnership that contributes to the airline\u2019s efforts to accelerate our sustainability target.\n\n\u201cThrough these solutions, we seek to play a greater part in building a legacy for future generations and enhancing our own airline\u2019s sustainability efforts,\u201d Ahmad Luqman said in a statement yesterday.\n\nFuel Insight is a cost and emissions monitoring solution that works by understanding data from the aircraft to uncover valuable intelligence that helps increase fuel efficiency and reduce waste.\n\nIt also gives operators actionable intelligence at multiple levels allowing analysts to drill down macro trends to understand issues on a per-flight level.\n\nThe software uses GE Digital\u2019s Event Measurement System (EMS) aviation data and analytics platform to merge flight data with flight plans, load sheets and fuel uplift data, identify the most attainable fuel savings opportunities, and track the incremental savings across the operation.\n\nFlightPulse, meanwhile, puts data directly into the hands of pilots, allowing them to visualise their savings over time.\n\nPilots who understand their own performance can adjust their flight plans to maximise safety and fuel efficiency.\n\nSecure benchmarking and data sharing allows crew members to see their contribution to projects and dramatically shortens the feedback loop.\n\nMAB evaluated the software with an extensive team of pilots, dispatchers and analysts who endorsed the software solution, which is hosted on GE Digital\u2019s EMS platform.\n\nEMS is built on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform providing compute, data, and security services.\n\nGE Digital\u2019s GM of the aviation software business Andrew Coleman said the company is committed to environmental excellence and that includes ensuring its customers are empowered to reduce the impact of their technology and environmental footprint within their operations.\n\n\u201cThese solutions will help MAB to leverage software to improve efficiency and reduce carbon emissions,\u201d Coleman added.\n\nThe solution will be implemented by the GE Digital aviation software teams in Austin, Texas and Shanghai, China.\n\nAdditionally, GE Digital provides MAB with the tools to build its big data analytics and leverage modern tools for data analysis

But fans in Malaysia have something to look forward to as two locals are working on a real-life version of the game \u2013 and this time, you can finally taste your veggies.\n\nWith the help of artificial intelligence and, in the near future, drones, Aquaville Asia hopes to become the world\u2019s first aquaponics farm where subscribers can nurture actual crops through their phones.\n\nFeeling like kale this week but kangkung the next? No problem, just tap on your screen and come harvest day, you will be greeted at your doorstep with fresh greens harvested from your own aquaponic plot.\n\nThat\u2019s the plan, at least \u2013 but for the time being, the concept is already in motion where subscribers can get five packs of vegetables delivered four times a month, with optional tilapia fish.\n\nAquaville founder Chia Weng Yan tells FMT that the idea came to him in the middle of the night. \u201cI dreamt about it and jotted down \u2018FarmVille in real life\u2019,\u201d the 40-year-old says.\n\n\u201cI created a pitch deck for it thinking it was a great idea, but didn\u2019t execute it and kept it on my computer for a long time,\u201d he adds, explaining that he struggled to find someone with the technological know-how to make his literal dream a reality.\n\nThen, in July last year, Chia found the perfect person for the job.\n\nLoke Chung Eng had posted on Facebook about robotics and projects involving IOT, or \u201cinternet of things\u201d, a network of physical objects embedded with sensors, software and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data.\n\nA phone call later and Chia had joined forces with Loke, 33, to create Aquaville Asia. The duo worked for months on the concept.\n\nWhile Loke spent time programming the AI system, Chia reached out to urban farmers, friends and family members to get them on board.\n\nThe duo forged an alliance with AHA Services Malaysia, a farm run by urban agriculturalists who provide Aquaville with all their farming requirements, including maintenance, harvest and delivery of fresh produce to subscribers.\n\nChia and Loke leave the farming to these experts and do their share by equipping the farm with Aquaville\u2019s AI technology.\n\n\u201cWe provide them with smart-farm capabilities so if any subscriptions come in, they are ready to harvest and deliver the produce,\u201d Chia explains.\n\nHe adds that using AI, Loke created a way to spot diseases in crops using an NDVI camera that scans vegetables at different wavelengths \u201cso you know if they are dying ahead of time\u201d.\n\nThe AI system can even monitor pH levels, humidity, heat and water levels. All their crops are pesticide-free.\n\nAquaville was officially launched in January this year, and subscribers have been effusive about how lush and crisp their vegetables are, compared with those bought in a store.\n\nSome customers have also funnelled their harvests to the needy, among them three companies that donated to a special-needs home in Petaling Jaya \u2013 sending bundles of fresh greens to feed 74 children between January and June \u2013 as well as contributed towards the white flag movement.\n\nIn the near future, Chia and Loke aim to introduce an application and drone system that will swoop over crops and capture real-time footage. Subscribers will be able to monitor their greens and control them through the app.\n\nAdditionally, the duo hope to empower the less fortunate and provide deaf, mute and B40 families with job opportunities on the farm.\n\nIt may take a few years for this FarmVille dream to fully become a reality, but the Aquaville innovators are hopeful and looking forward to a bright and greener future.\n\nFor fresh produce at your door each week or to help the needy, contact Aquaville Asia via Facebook or check out their website.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["taste", "malaysias", "veggies", "provide", "ai", "loke", "crops", "system", "chia", "aquaville", "farmville", "subscribers", "fresh", "vegetables"], "summary": "PETALING JAYA: Thousands were left cropless and devastated last year when Zynga\u2019s popular game FarmVille announced the end of its 11-year legacy.\nBut fans in Malaysia have something to look forward to as two locals are working on a real-life version of the game \u2013 and this time, you can finally taste your veggies.\nAquaville founder Chia Weng Yan tells FMT that the idea came to him in the middle of the night.\nWhile Loke spent time programming the AI system, Chia reached out to urban farmers, friends and family members to get them on board.\nThe AI system can even monitor pH levels, humidity, heat and water levels.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-08-12 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "1989 Proton Black Knight Wins \u201cUnexceptional\u201d Award In UK Car Festival", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL2Z1bi8yMDIxLzA4LzAzLzE5ODktcHJvdG9uLWJsYWNrLWtuaWdodC13aW5zLXVuZXhjZXB0aW9uYWwtYXdhcmQtaW4tdWstY2FyLWZlc3RpdmFsL9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL2Z1bi8yMDIxLzA4LzAzLzE5ODktcHJvdG9uLWJsYWNrLWtuaWdodC13aW5zLXVuZXhjZXB0aW9uYWwtYXdhcmQtaW4tdWstY2FyLWZlc3RpdmFsL2FtcC8?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Azizul Rahman Ismail", "Maya Suraya"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Proton-Black-Knight.jpeg", "text": "Subscribe to our new Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates.\n\nThe Proton Saga is Malaysia\u2019s first car and was the symbol of the nation\u2019s success.

The colour of its bright and deep red seeds was the inspiration for the signature hue of the national car.\n\nHowever, the reality is, the name \u201cSaga\u201d was the winning entry in a competition held in 1984.\n\nThe winner, Staf Sarjan Ismail Jaafar said that the name is actually an acronym for Safety, Achievement, Greatness, and Ability.\n\nThey Don\u2019t Make Them Like They Used To\n\nThe first generation Saga had many iterations and was in production up to 1992.\n\nOne of its most notable versions of the Saga was a hatchback released in 1987 during the peak of popularity of a certain TV show starring a certain modified Pontiac Trans Am.\n\nThe hatchback was called the Proton Knight. It was later named Proton Saga Aeroback, perhaps for copyright reasons. But to be fair, the new name is more descriptive.\n\nAt the same time, the Proton Saga was also sold all over the world including the UK.\n\nIn fact, the UK even got versions of the Proton Saga that are not available in Malaysia.

This is the most likely scenario,\u201d said Le Parisien this morning.\n\n\u201cIt only seems to be a matter of hours,\u201d suggested sports daily L\u2019Equipe, which proclaimed \u201cwe are entering the most incredible days in the history of the French championship\u201d.\n\nBefore signing the contract in Paris, Messi will first have to undergo a medical examination.\n\nStressing no deals had been done, Messi conceded at his tearful farewell news conference in Barcelona yesterday that joining PSG was a \u201cpossibility\u201d.\n\nIn reality, they are the only club who can afford what is expected to be a deal worth \u20ac35 million a year for the 34-year-old Argentine.\n\n\u201cI gave everything for Barcelona from the first day that I arrived right to the last. I never imagined having to say goodbye,\u201d a tearful Messi told the news conference.\n\n\u201cI have still not come to terms with the reality of leaving this club now \u2013 I love this club.\u201d\n\nThis morning, the images of the Argentinian in tears leapt out from the pages of all the Spanish sports dailies such as Marca, AS and Sport.\n\nOne note of discord came from a group of Barcelona fans, represented by Parisian lawyer Juan Branco, who announced today their intention to lodge a complaint with the European Commission in connection with the rules of financial fair play that Barcelona and PSG must follow.\n\nThe group also intends to ask the French courts to suspend a possible transfer.\n\nMessi, widely considered the most gifted player in the history of the game, won 35 trophies at Barcelona after joining as a 13-year-old \u2013 including four Champions Leagues and 10 league titles while his 672 goals are a record tally for one club.\n\n\u2018Great for Ligue 1\u2019\n\nDespite offering to cut his salary by half to seal a new five-year deal which a club carrying debts of \u20ac1.2 billion and the player had agreed on, the agreement foundered on strict Spanish league salary restrictions.\n\nSome in France\u2019s Ligue 1 have mixed feelings about the impending arrival of Messi who will form a superstar attacking force alongside Kylian Mbappe and Neymar, who earns a reported \u20ac36 million a year and is a former Barcelona teammate of the Argentine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary for Ligue 1,\u201d said Metz coach Frederic Antonetti.\n\n\u201cBut for a purist like me, Messi should have finished his career at Barcelona.\u201d\n\nThis summer PSG have already added veteran Spanish defender Sergio Ramos from Real Madrid, where he won four Champions League crowns, and Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma.\n\nMessi is a free agent.\n\nRamos also arrived on a free transfer.\n\nA move to the Parc des Princes would mean a reunion with his Argentina international colleague Angel di Maria.\n\nAn added attraction is that coach Mauricio Pochettino, like Messi, started his career at Newell\u2019s Old Boys in Rosario, Argentina.\n\nPochettino has been giving nothing away on the arrival of Messi.\n\n\u201cThere have been lots of rumours. Lots of things are being said,\u201d he said as PSG laboured to a 2-1 win over Troyes in their opening game of the new league season.\n\nJorge Sampaoli, the Argentine coach of PSG\u2019s bitter rivals Marseille, said the arrival of Messi can only be good news for French football.\n\n\u201cIt would be great for Ligue 1, he\u2019s the best player in the world,\u201d said Sampaoli.\n\n\u201cFrench football has won a lot and grown a lot in recent seasons.\n\n\u201cEven if he goes to a club other than Marseille, it will be good. Everyone would be riveted.

year\u2019s Merdeka will be like no other, courtesy of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nWith most of the Klang Valley and other urban centres under strict lockdown, the usual display of patriotic sentiments will be somewhat drowned out by the pervasive gloom of the moment.\n\nYet, 27 artists have chosen to express their love for the country during the month of Merdeka by displaying their works in an online exhibition titled very simply \u201cJalur Gemilang\u201d.\n\nOpen for viewing until the end of the month, the exhibition is hosted by Artas Galeri, an art gallery based in Petaling Jaya.\n\nAccording to Roy Ng, Artas Galeri\u2019s director, plans were already underway to hold a physical Merdeka-themed exhibition in the months leading up to August.\n\nHowever, with the extension of MCO 3.0, it became painfully clear that Plan B would have to be executed.\n\n\u201cDue to the pandemic and the increasing number of cases, I decided to launch an online show with an e-catalogue instead,\u201d he said.\n\nThat way, art enthusiasts will still be able to view the art pieces themselves without leaving the safety of their homes.\n\n\u201cMost of these artists\u2019 works exhibited in the \u2018Jalur Gemilang\u2019 exhibition are based on our national flag\u2019s colours,\u201d Ng said, adding that a majority of them used copious amounts of red, yellow, blue and white in multiple art styles including abstract, still-life and figurative.\n\nAccording to him, the artists are a fascinating group made up of graduates fresh out of art school as well as senior artists who have made a name for themselves in the art world.\n\nFMT had the pleasure of interviewing six of the artists regarding their hopes for the country this Merdeka month.\n\nYuki Lim Xiao Mun, artist of the almost ethereal \u201cThe Paradise Land\u201d, had this to say: \u201cMy hope for this Merdeka month is that our country can be restored to good condition after the economic hardship caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nShe said it was also her sincere hope that Malaysia\u2019s leaders will lead the country down the right path by practising integrity in their leadership.\n\nLikewise, Fadzril Fakaruddin encouraged Malaysians to stay united no matter what the circumstances, so that together, they could be free of Covid-19 for good.\n\nWhile Hamir Soib hopes for better governance, fellow artist Najib Ahmad Bamadhaj is hopeful for a return to normalcy and the good \u2018ol pre-Covid days.\n\nNational unity is something that veteran artist, Awang Damit, believes is vital if the country is to survive these difficult times.\n\nAnd another artist, Zulkefli Talha, reminded Malaysians to love each other as fellow countrymen regardless of racial or religious differences.\n\n\u201cLeaders have to be good examples for the people. And both leaders and the people have to work together to end this pandemic and return Malaysia to its former glory.\u201d\n\nNg told FMT that the pandemic had been especially tough on many artists. The numerous lockdowns this past year and a half meant potential buyers were unable to view the artworks personally and as a consequence, there was little to no sales.\n\nHe said there was an urgent need for artists to find alternative avenues to display their work so that they could continue to earn a decent living.\n\nNg explained that things have not been looking up for artists for a while now. Prior to the pandemic, the sluggish economy meant artists struggled to make a sale. The lockdowns brought about by the pandemic, only made things worse.\n\n\u201cMost collectors and buyers prefer to see the pieces in person. There\u2019s a huge difference between seeing artworks personally and virtually,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen you view an artwork physically, you will be able to see the texture, notice the colour tones and spot the little details. That\u2019s something these virtual exhibitions sadly cannot offer.\u201d\n\nHowever, this has not dampened the spirit of art collectors such as Brendan Siva in regard to the \u201cJalur Gemilang\u201d exhibition.\n\n\u201cEach piece is unique as an individual interpretation and expression of what Malaysia represents and symbolises in the eyes of the artist. It reflects the rich cultural and social fabric of Malaysia and its people.\u201d\n\nAnother art collector, Bingley Sim added, \u201cThe different styles and approaches in the use of the red, blue, yellow and white colours in the artworks reflect the exuberant spirit of Malaysia.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe works in the \u2018Jalur Gemilang\u2019 exhibition this year are all about resilience, tenacity and hope,\u201d said fellow art collector Cheow Wee.\n\n\u201cArt is a topic that brings people together no matter what ethnicity or religious belief one belongs to.\u201d\n\nHe added that since artists too are experiencing a bad year, it is important for other Malaysians to step up and support them.\n\n\u201cWe want to urge local artists never to give up as many of us will support them in our own little ways. After all, Kita Jaga Kita.\u201d\n\nTo find out more about Artas Galeri, visit them on Instagram, Facebook or WhatsApp 010-9009363 for an e-catalogue.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["exhibition", "art", "local", "pandemic", "month", "works", "merdeka", "view", "artists", "mark", "country", "online", "artist"], "summary": "PETALING JAYA: There\u2019s no question that this year\u2019s Merdeka will be like no other, courtesy of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nYet, 27 artists have chosen to express their love for the country during the month of Merdeka by displaying their works in an online exhibition titled very simply \u201cJalur Gemilang\u201d.\nOpen for viewing until the end of the month, the exhibition is hosted by Artas Galeri, an art gallery based in Petaling Jaya.\nFMT had the pleasure of interviewing six of the artists regarding their hopes for the country this Merdeka month.\n\u201cWe want to urge local artists never to give up as many of us will support them in our own little ways.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-08-13 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "US smash world record in men\u2019s 4x100m medley relay", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9zcG9ydHMvMjAyMS8wOC8wMS91cy1zbWFzaC13b3JsZC1yZWNvcmQtaW4tbWVucy00eDEwMG0tbWVkbGV5LXJlbGF5L9IBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/us-relay-4x100-010821-ap.jpg", "text": "TOKYO: A storming butterfly leg from Caeleb Dressel powered the US to a new world record and the gold medal in the men\u2019s Olympic 4x100m medley relay final today.\n\nThe US team of Ryan Murphy, Michael Andrew, Dressel and Zach Apple touched in 3:26.78s to smash the global 3:27.28s mark set at the 2009 World Championships.\n\nBritain came second in 3:27.51s and Italy were third in 3:29.17s.\n\nThe Americans were trailing at 200m after Andrew\u2019s breaststroke leg against Britain\u2019s Adam Peaty but when Dressel hit the water that all changed.\n\nHe clawed back the lead, leaving Apple to finish the job.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["mens", "water", "4x100m", "leg", "medley", "trailing", "touched", "dressel", "record", "world", "zach", "apple", "todaythe", "smash", "relay", "tokyo"], "summary": "TOKYO: A storming butterfly leg from Caeleb Dressel powered the US to a new world record and the gold medal in the men\u2019s Olympic 4x100m medley relay final today.\nThe US team of Ryan Murphy, Michael Andrew, Dressel and Zach Apple touched in 3:26.78s to smash the global 3:27.28s mark set at the 2009 World Championships.\nBritain came second in 3:27.51s and Italy were third in 3:29.17s.\nThe Americans were trailing at 200m after Andrew\u2019s breaststroke leg against Britain\u2019s Adam Peaty but when Dressel hit the water that all changed.\nHe clawed back the lead, leaving Apple to finish the job.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-08-01 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Meet Ita O\u2019Brian: in-demand intimacy coordinator", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9sZWlzdXJlL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvMjAyMS8wNy8zMC9tZWV0LWl0YS1vYnJpYW4taW4tZGVtYW5kLWludGltYWN5LWNvb3JkaW5hdG9yL9IBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ita-lifestyle.jpg", "text": "LONDON: Britain\u2019s Ita O\u2019Brien is one of entertainment\u2019s unsung stars, ensuring actors are comfortable filming their most sensitive scenes in a job she has made her own.\n\nThe 56-year-old intimacy coordinator has been a key figure behind sex scenes in acclaimed television series such as \u201cI May Destroy You\u201d, \u201cSex Education\u201d and \u201cNormal People\u201d.\n\nPreserving the intimacy of an artist filming a rape depiction, setting up a sex scene with a virgin actor, and identifying the limits each actor is comfortable with are all issues O\u2019Brien is regularly confronted with.\n\nA typical conversation she regularly has with stars, she says, goes along the lines of: \u201cHe is going to put his hand here, you put yours there and then you start the fellatio.\u201d\n\nShe sees her role as one of ensuring \u201copen communication\u201d between the director and the actors on all intimate scenes that may include kissing, nudity or sex.\n\n\u201cThis is a process by which we bring our professional structure to intimacy\u201d, allowing the on-screen stars to \u201cbring all of the skills of the actor to this moment,\u201d she adds.\n\n\u201cWe agree on a consent of touch and then a clear process by which we choreograph the intimate contact clearly. So it\u2019s just like dance.\u201d\n\nEach scene will be discussed and rehearsed beforehand, away from the glare of the dozens of people usually present on a set.\n\n\u201cWhen the camera rolls or they\u2019re up on stage, they know they can perform that intimate contact, knowing where they\u2019re going to be touched,\u201d she says.\n\nAt the heart of her philosophy is consent, in an industry which has been rocked in recent years by sexual assault claims. Her motto, which she says she often repeats to actors, is: \u201cYour \u2018no\u2019 is a gift. Tell us your \u2018no\u2019, so that we can trust your \u2018yes'\u201d.\n\n\u2018Incredibly hard\u2019\n\nO\u2019Brien was a dancer in the theatre for 10 years and then an actress for eight before she sensed an opportunity and became an intimacy coordinator in 2014.\n\nIt was a pioneering move at a time when actors\u2019 consent was little talked about, and before the #MeToo movement against sexual abuse and sexual harassment.\n\nBefore then, \u201cif an actor ever said \u2018no\u2019, they\u2019d be a troublemaker or a diva, and they would certainly be worried about losing their job,\u201d she recalls.\n\nIn such an environment, she describes her early days in the role as \u201cincredibly hard\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had productions where I\u2019ve been told not to speak to the director,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m serving the director\u2019s vision, but the director doesn\u2019t want to speak to me because he\u2019s a 74-year-old man, who basically doesn\u2019t want to acknowledge my existence.\u201d\n\nOn other occasions, she was not allowed on the set because the actors or director did not want her help.\n\nAttitudes have since changed a lot. The profession is becoming more popular and O\u2019Brien is in high demand, especially after Michaela Coel dedicated her best actress BAFTA win this year for \u201cI May Destroy You\u201d to her.\n\n\u201cThank you, Ita, for making a space safe, for creating physical, emotional and professional boundaries, so we can make work about exploitation, loss of respect, about abuse of powers,

Covid jabs per day and are moving towards increasing to 20,000 doses per day. \u2014 Picture by Sayuti Zainudin\n\nFollow us on Instagram and subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates.\n\nGEORGE TOWN, Aug 1 \u2014 Factories and small businesses in Penang, especially those hard hit by disruptions due to the Covid-19 pandemic, are looking forward to resuming operations as soon as possible even if it means making vaccination mandatory for their workers.\n\nAs there are currently no laws to enforce mandatory Covid-19 vaccination on workers, some companies are taking steps to get their workers to register for vaccination.\n\nPenang Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM) chairman Datuk Jimmy Ong said most factories here are encouraging their workers to register for their Covid jabs through various methods.\n\n\u201cSome companies are giving paid leave to their workers to go for vaccination and some are even offering monetary rewards,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the main reason multinational companies (MNC) are setting up Program Imunisasi Industri Covid-19 Kerjasama Awam-Swasta (Pikas) vaccination centres within their own factory grounds is to encourage their workers to get vaccinated.\n\nHe said the Pikas PPVs in Penang are now dispensing 15,000 doses per day and are moving towards increasing to 20,000 doses per day.\n\nHe said the vaccination of workers in MNCs is progressing very fast due to the on-site PPVs for larger factories which employ thousands of workers.\n\n\u201cIt is slower for small medium enterprises as they can only send their workers to the Pikas PPVs and there are only two of those now; one in Jawi and one at Equatorial Hotel,\u201d he said.\n\nEven with vaccination in full force, Ong said some of the companies in the manufacturing sector have continued to conduct screening of workers every two to three weeks.\n\n\u201cScreening still has to continue to control any potential spread of cases within the factories because we know, even those vaccinated still have a risk of contracting Covid-19,\u201d he said.\n\nFMM Penang branch offers a Penang SAFE programme for factories to conduct screening tests for its workers at a lower rate of RM60 per person.\n\nOng said the programme recommends that any company taking up the package conduct screening of 100 per cent of its staff in the first round.\n\n\u201cAfter that, they can conduct screening on 20 per cent of their staff for the second round and another 20 per cent on the third round, and so on,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, one of the SMEs in Penang, Chemdyes Sdn Bhd, has checked labour laws on ways to compel its employees to get vaccinated.\n\nThe company\u2019s managing director Joe Sidek said it was informed that there are at present no laws for the company to compel its employees to register for vaccination.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t legally force them to register for vaccination, it is a personal right, so what we do is to encourage them to do it as a way to safeguard everyone\u2019s safety in the workplace,\u201d he said.\n\nThe factory, specialising in textile chemicals, has about 22 workers and Joe said all have registered for vaccination.\n\nA nurse administers a dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at the Pikas vaccination centre at the Bukit Jawi Golf Resort in Penang June 17, 2021. \u2014 Picture by Sayuti Zainudin\n\nHe said despite the downturn in the textile industry due to the pandemic, Chemdyes recorded stable revenue last year and expects an increase in revenue this year.\n\n\u201cWe have kept all our staff and did not cut any pay so we have been very fortunate and we want to ensure that everyone is safe, we do not want to have any cases that could disrupt production,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said he would allow his workers to stay home for a week and to undergo screening tests if they have been exposed to places with a high number of Covid-19 cases.\n\nMeanwhile, it was reported that the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) is considering making vaccination of all employees in the retail sector one of the pre-conditions for approval for companies to resume operation, during the National Recovery Plan (NRP) period.\n\nYin\u2019s Sourdough Bakery and cafe co-founder Ong Seng Keat has already made it compulsory for all of its 40 workers to sign up for vaccination.\n\n\u201cWe will check our workers\u2019 MySejahtera to make sure they have registered and if we have to pay for it, we will,\u201d he said.\n\nHis company has already paid for all of his workers in Klang Valley to be vaccinated under a retail industry vaccination programme.\n\nHe hopes such programmes will be available in Penang so he can send all his workers to be vaccinated as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cThe government really needs to speed up its vaccination programme for the economic frontliners because we deal with people every day,\u201d he said.\n\nMugshot Cafe co-founder Jesse Tan agrees with Ong that vaccination for economic frontliners should be sped up.\n\n\u201cSo far, all of our staff have registered for vaccination but they are still waiting for their appointments,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of Mugshot\u2019s staff contracted Covid-19 a few months back due to close contact with a relative but fortunately, it did not spread to the other staff in the cafe.\n\n\u201cThere are 15 of us in the cafe and all of us went for screening the moment we found out he was positive but luckily, we were all negative,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the incident further emphasises the importance of vaccination for all workers who deal with customers daily.\n\nAs for Hin Bus Depot manager Tan Shih Thoe, he is also considering only allowing fully vaccinated vendors to participate in the Hin Bus Depot weekly bazaar, when they are finally allowed to reopen.\n\n\u201cI was just thinking about this, especially for the market, whether I should only allow vendors who are fully vaccinated to participate... main consideration is their safety since the market is considered a crowded space,\u201d he said.\n\nThere used to be 70 vendors at the weekly market before the pandemic but due to standard operating procedures (SOPs), the number of vendors came down to around 55 each week.\n\nThe market has been closed for more than two months due to the movement control order (MCO) and subsequent phases of the NRP.\n\nHin Bus Depot has around 15 tenants, consisting of eateries and artisans, and Tan said he will also strongly encourage the tenants and their workers to register for vaccination.\n\n\u201cMost of them are in favour of vaccination as they see it as the only solution to things getting back to normal,\u201d he said.\n\nFurry Kids pet shop owner Dalbinder Singh also agrees that it is important for those in the retail sector to be vaccinated.\n\n\u201cWe are meeting people and customers daily so it is important for the safety of everyone,\u201d he

Here\u2019s what you need to know:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Can employers make vaccination compulsory for employees?\n\nEmployment lawyer Donovan Cheah said there is no law now that disallows mandatory vaccination policies by employers, and that there are no known court cases in the country about whether such a policy would be legal.\n\n\u201cGiven the severity of the pandemic, having a mandatory vaccination policy is one of the ways for employers to safeguard the safety and health of their employees and curb the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cHowever, there are no reported court cases in Malaysia about the legality of mandatory vaccination policies, and whether an employer can take disciplinary action against an employee for refusing to vaccinate,\u201d he said, but noted there have been reported cases in countries like Australia and the US which upheld the dismissal of employees who refuse to comply with their employer\u2019s mandatory vaccination policy.\n\nSpecialist employment lawyer Marcus van Geyzel said employers would generally be able to make it compulsory for their employees to undergo COVID-19 vaccination if this is due to a government-imposed requirement.\n\n\u201cYes, if the MDTCA/KPDNHEP makes employee vaccinations mandatory or a pre-condition for approval to operate, the affected employers can impose this requirement on employees,\u201d he told Malay Mail.\n\n\u201cHowever, employers should be cautious where there are special circumstances, such as where an employee is unable to receive a vaccination due to a medical condition,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIn general, it would be very unlikely for an employee to successfully challenge an employer\u2019s mandatory vaccination policy where vaccinations have been declared a pre-condition for operations by the government.\n\nIn order to bring a successful legal action, an employee would have to show that in mandating vaccination, the employer has exercised its managerial power in a non-genuine manner, or that there was victimisation or an unfair labour practice,\u201d he said.\n\n2. What if the employees say no to vaccination?\n\nCheah said employers can choose to take disciplinary action against employees who refuse vaccination, and that whether such action is reasonable depends on the situation.\n\n\u201cWhile an employer cannot physically compel an employee to take the vaccine, an employee\u2019s freedom of choice is not the same thing as freedom from consequences. There are no legal prohibitions against an employer implementing a mandatory vaccination policy, although how employers deal with breaches of this policy may be evaluated by the courts,\u201d he said.\n\nCheah said disciplinary action including dismissal may be seen as reasonable, taking into account various factors.\n\nHe listed examples such as the employee\u2019s reason for refusal; whether the employee\u2019s refusal amounts to a breach of their duties or has caused loss or damage to the company or other employees; whether the employee\u2019s job function requires him/her to have regular and frequent physical interaction with third parties.\n\nOther factors listed by Cheah are the current severity of the pandemic; whether the employer\u2019s business deals with high-risk individuals; and whether vaccination is a pre-condition from the authorities for the employer to operate.\n\n\u201cWhere an employee has a legitimate reason to refuse vaccination (eg: health condition), employers should explore other ways to address the risk, such as requiring them to carry out their duties remotely and not allowing them to enter the premises without notice,\u201d Cheah added.\n\nVan Geyzel said employers would have several options, when vaccinations are a precondition for operations but there are employees who refuse to get vaccinated.\n\nThese options are to engage with the employees, or to transfer employees to alternative roles, or to ultimately stop employing the employee.\n\n\u201cThe first step should always be for employers to have clear and open conversations with these employees to ensure that they understand the reason for the vaccination requirement.\n\n\u201cEmployers can also consider redesignating or redeploying the affected employees to other roles within the business which are not customer-facing and which may be exempted from the regulatory requirements,\u201d he said.\n\nIf redesignation and redeployment is not an option, employers would be legally able to terminate the employee\u2019s employment if it is reasonable in the circumstances, he said.\n\nVan Geyzel said there is a general legal expectation that an employee has to follow all lawful and reasonable instructions by the employer.\n\nHe added that it can be argued that an employee is carrying out an act of insubordination by refusing to be vaccinated under the circumstances, as the employee is wilfully disobeying a lawful and reasonable order issued by the employer.\n\n\u201cAny punishment or action by the employer in response to insubordination has to be reasonable or proportionate, and it can be said here that where the result of the employee\u2019s vaccination is that the business would not be allowed to operate, there are serious repercussions and therefore termination of employment is a reasonable response by the employer.\n\n\u201cAnother potential justification for termination of employment is that an unvaccinated employee would be unable to perform the job or service for which the employee was employed. This would be the case if an unvaccinated employee is not permitted by law to work.\n\n\u201cIn such a situation, it may be reasonable for an employer to deem that the employment contract cannot be performed and therefore can be terminated,\u201d he said.\n\n3. What if an employee says no to vaccination due to health conditions?\n\nAs for employees who are unable to receive COVID-19 vaccinations due to a medical condition, van Geyzel said employers could explore measures such as redesignation.\n\n\u201cFirstly, I don\u2019t think the government would make vaccinations mandatory for such employees.\n\n\u201cSecondly, even if the government issued a blanket requirement, the employer should see if it\u2019s possible to apply for an exemption for that employee, or again see if redeployment or redesignation is an option.\n\n\u201cTermination should always be a last resort, but if the employer has acted reasonably, then termination should be possible under the law,\u201d he said, also saying that an employee would be unlikely to succeed in an unfair dismissal claim if an employer treated the employee fairly and could show that the termination was reasonable in the circumstances.\n\nFor employees with pre-existing health conditions that prevent them from being vaccinated, employment lawyer Jayasingam Poopalasingam said employers can seek to take mitigation measures such as changing their work roles or have them work remotely.\n\nHowever, if the nature of the business and nature of the employee\u2019s work requires vaccination, but vaccination is not possible due to the health condition and mitigating measures are not feasible through no fault of both the employer or the employee, the employer may be left with no choice but to terminate employment.\n\nThe employee could under such circumstances file a complaint to claim that the dismissal was without just cause and excuse, but it would ultimately be for the Industrial Court to decide if the dismissal was with just cause and excuse, he said.\n\n4. Putting it into the employment contract and putting it in writing\n\nJayasingam, who is also co-chair of the Bar Council\u2019s Industrial and Employment Law Committee, similarly said there are currently no laws that mandate COVID-19 vaccination for employees.\n\nThis means that for existing employees, an employer cannot \u201cforce\u201d them to be vaccinated, but can only seek to persuade and convince the employee of the need to be vaccinated due to reasons such as the nature of the work.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing much you can do, you cannot force the employee to go for vaccination, you cannot force an employee to undergo a medical procedure, it has to be by way of consent,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf they are existing employees, it must be by way of consent. They have a right to refuse vaccination, that\u2019s why we advise employers to obtain the written consent of employees to be vaccinated,\u201d he said, explaining that a mere verbal consent is not advisable as an employee could later claim to have never given consent.\n\nFor employees who pose a high risk due to the nature of their job as a frontliner or being in contact with others but refuse vaccination, employers can transfer them to another position where they do not deal with customers or other employees, he said.\n\nBut for new employees, an employer can make being vaccinated against COVID-19 a part of the employment contract prior to them joining the company, he said.\n\n\u201cYou cannot force it but what you can do is if you are having new employees, you can put it as a term of the contract, where they must be vaccinated before they are hired for employment, or they must undertake they will be vaccinated after they join you,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the new recruit would have the option of not joining the company upon viewing the contract, while employers can terminate employment if the new hire subsequently does not comply with instructions to be vaccinated as promised under the contract.\n\n5. About legal action\n\nIf an employer forces an employee to undergo COVID-19 vaccination, the employee can possibly walk out of the job and try to claim \u201cconstructive dismissal\u201d, Jayasingam said.\n\nIn cases of constructive dismissal claims, the employer does not have to issue a letter of termination, but the employee is essentially claiming that the employer has done something in breach of his contractual rights and that the employer\u2019s conduct had resulted in the employee\u2019s resignation.\n\nSuch an employee could then seek to prove their case in the Industrial Court to claim for monetary compensation and reinstatement to the job with all previous benefits and rights unaffected, including the right to not be forced to be vaccinated, Jayasingam said. It would ultimately be for the Industrial Court to decide if there was constructive dismissal.\n\nAlternatively, employees can also file a claim in civil courts but this is usually not preferred as the compensation is very small, with most employees likely to go to the Industrial Court instead, he said.\n\nUnlike new employees who have agreed to being vaccinated under the employment contract and can be terminated for non-compliance, Jayasingam said employers could face labour complaints by existing employees if the latter are terminated over their non-vaccinated status.\n\n\u201cIf the employer terminates them for not being vaccinated, the employee can file a complaint of dismissal without just cause and excuse,\u201d he said, explaining the process as involving employees filing complaints with the Industrial Relations Department under the Human Resources Ministry within 60 days of dismissal to see whether it could be resolved amicably, with the matter to be referred by the department director-general to the Industrial Court if it cannot be resolved.\n\nBut in situations where it is a government requirement for staff to be vaccinated in order to operate, an employer may have reason to terminate an employee who refuses to get vaccinated if it affects the business, Jayasingam said.\n\n\u201cSo the employer may have just cause and excuse to terminate the employee because he cannot carry on business,\u201d he said.\n\nJayasingam gave a hypothetical example, where an employee who works as a carer at a nursing home refuses to be vaccinated when it is a government requirement for such work, and the carer may as a result pose a risk to the elderly persons at the nursing home.\n\nIn such a situation and where there are no mitigation measures possible, the employer \u2014 who is unable to force the employee to be vaccinated \u2014 may opt to terminate the employee as it affects the business or may result in the nursing home having to be closed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s for the Industrial Court to decide whether what the employer did was reasonable or not,\u201d he said.\n\n6. Can the government make COVID-19 vaccination mandatory for employees?\n\nVan Geyzel said there may be a stronger basis for a compulsory vaccination requirement by the government for certain industries.\n\n\u201cThe laws that have been passed in response to the pandemic grant the government very broad powers to impose SOPs or pre-conditions for businesses to operate, and when it comes to roles or industries that have clear and frequent face-to-face contact and interaction with the general public, there is a stronger justification for the authorities to impose mandatory vaccination requirements. This is especially so as vaccinations are widely available and accessible.\n\n\u201cHowever, if the government overreaches and tries to impose mandatory vaccinations on other roles or industries where there is no clear face-to-face interaction or risk, I could see this being open to legal challenge,\u201d he said.\n\nJayasingam said the government could impose mandatory vaccinations on the general population including employees by passing an Act in Parliament, but believes that implementing such a policy of forcing vaccinations would only be a \u201clast resort.\u201d \u2014 Malay Mail", "keyword": ["vaccination", "employee", "employer", "say", "staff", "heres", "employers", "lawyers", "employees", "employment", "mandatory", "covid19", "vaccinated", "reasonable", "vaccinations"], "summary": "\u201cYes, if the MDTCA/KPDNHEP makes employee vaccinations mandatory or a pre-condition for approval to operate, the affected employers can impose this requirement on employees,\u201d he told Malay Mail.\n\u201cIn general, it would be very unlikely for an employee to successfully challenge an employer\u2019s mandatory vaccination policy where vaccinations have been declared a pre-condition for operations by the government.\n\u201cFirstly, I don\u2019t think the government would make vaccinations mandatory for such employees.\nCan the government make COVID-19 vaccination mandatory for employees?\n\u201cHowever, if the government overreaches and tries to impose mandatory vaccinations on other roles or industries where there is no clear face-to-face interaction or risk, I could see this being open to legal challenge,\u201d he said.", "news": "SoyaCincau.com", "date": "2021-08-02 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Ministry mulls proposal to control price of Covid-19 test kit", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbGF5bWFpbC5jb20vbmV3cy9tYWxheXNpYS8yMDIxLzA4LzAzL21pbmlzdHJ5LW11bGxzLXByb3Bvc2FsLXRvLWNvbnRyb2wtcHJpY2Utb2YtY292aWQtMTktdGVzdC1raXQvMTk5NDkwMtIBfGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbGF5bWFpbC5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wOC8wMy9taW5pc3RyeS1tdWxscy1wcm9wb3NhbC10by1jb250cm9sLXByaWNlLW9mLWNvdmlkLTE5LXRlc3Qta2l0LzE5OTQ5MDI?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://media2.malaymail.com/resize_cache/uploads/articles/2021/2021-07/covid_test_kit2_26072021-seo.jpg", "text": "Deputy Minister Datuk Rosol Wahid said based on feedback from the public, the test kit price is a burden especially to the low-income groups and families with many children. \u2014 Bernama pic\n\nFollow us on Instagram and subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates.\n\nKUALA BERANG, Aug 3 \u2015 The Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) is considering a proposal to control the price of the Covid-19 test kit, said Deputy Minister Datuk Rosol Wahid.\n\nHe said based on feedback from the public, the test kit price is a burden especially to the low-income groups and families with many children.\n\n\u201cWe were told that the price is RM39.90 each, not many can afford to buy it at that price.

Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on household income and made more people poorer, according to a study conducted by the Department of Statistics.\n\nThe Covid-19 impact study on household income in Malaysia for 2020 revealed that the number of poor households increased to 639,800 in 2020, up from 405,400 in 2019.\n\nThe findings of the study are contained in the Household Income Estimates and Incidence of Poverty Report, Malaysia, 2020 which the department released today.\n\nChief Statistician Datuk Seri Dr Mohd Uzir Mahidin said in a statement that the incidence of absolute poverty also increased, from 5.6 per cent in 2019 to 8.4 per cent in 2020, and that the incidence of hardcore poverty is estimated to increase from 0.4 per cent (2019) involving 27,200 households to 1.0 per cent involving 78,000 households.\n\nHe said the pandemic had also affected the structure of household groups, with 20 per cent of households from the M40 group with income between RM4,850 and RM10,959 having moved to the B40 group.\n\n\u201cHouseholds in the T20 group were also affected by the Covid-19 pandemic where 12.8 per cent of this group has shifted to the M40 group,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also said that as the percentage decrease in income for B40 and M40 households was larger than the T20 households group, the income distribution for B40 and M40 declined to 15.9 per cent (2019: 16.0 per cent) and 36.9 per cent (2019: 37.2 per cent), respectively.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the T20 group owned 47.2 per cent of income increased by 0.4 percentage points from 2019,\u201d he added.\n\nMohd Uzir said the mean of monthly household gross income decreased by negative 10.3 per cent to record RM7,089 as compared to RM7,901 in 2019 and added that the decline was contributed by households or individuals who experienced loss or reduction of income, particularly those with the status of employee, self-employed and others.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, this reduction of income was not only caused by job loss but also contributed by the reduction of working hours and increase in skill-related underemployment,\u201d he said.\n\nMohd Uzir said that all territories/states recorded a decline in mean and median of monthly household gross income. The Federal Territory of Putrajaya registered the lowest reduction in monthly household income and remained to record the highest mean and median of monthly household gross income as compared to other territories/states with RM12,322 and RM9,743, respectively.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, Kelantan remained to record the lowest mean and median income with RM4,411 and RM3,010, respectively,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also said that the incidence of absolute poverty by state shows that Sabah recorded the highest percentage of 25.3 per cent (2019: 19.5 per cent) while Kelantan recorded a significant increase in poverty by 8.8 percentage points to 21.2 per cent from 12.4 per cent (2019), followed by Terengganu by 5.9 percentage points to 12 per cent from 6.1 per cent (2019).\n\nMohd Uzir said the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic may be temporary as the economy is expected to improve and recover as the spread of the pandemic can be contained.\n\n\u201cFrom this analysis, it is found that the role of the federal and state governments as well as other relevant parties is pertinent in cushioning the impact of the pandemic as well as towards reviving the household income and the country\u2019s economy,\u201d he said.- Bernama", "keyword": ["study", "households", "poverty", "2019", "income", "household", "cent", "covid19", "uzir", "impact", "pandemic", "reveals", "percentage", "group", "significant"], "summary": "KUALA LUMPUR: The Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on household income and made more people poorer, according to a study conducted by the Department of Statistics.\nThe Covid-19 impact study on household income in Malaysia for 2020 revealed that the number of poor households increased to 639,800 in 2020, up from 405,400 in 2019.\nThe findings of the study are contained in the Household Income Estimates and Incidence of Poverty Report, Malaysia, 2020 which the department released today.\nMohd Uzir said that all territories/states recorded a decline in mean and median of monthly household gross income.\nThe Federal Territory of Putrajaya registered the lowest reduction in monthly household income and remained to record the highest mean and median of monthly household gross income as compared to other territories/states with RM12,322 and RM9,743, respectively.", "news": "The Sun Daily", "date": "2021-08-06 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Not so slick: Domestic Trade Ministry foils attempt to misappropriate 18,000kg of cooking oil", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEEHgxPt-i917aEqtS9q5XVIqGQgEKhAIACoHCAow-N7eCjC60NYBMLfbhwM?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Santhakumar A L"], "top-image": "https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2021/08/11/1252988.jpg", "text": "SHAH ALAM (Bernama): The Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry has foiled an attempt to misappropriate 18,000kg of cooking oil, 8,775 kg of which were subsidised 1kg packets.\n\nThe ministry's Selangor director Muhammad Zikril Azan Abdullah said raids carried out on two stores in Puchong found that the embezzlement activity was done by cutting the 1kg packets of subsidised cooking oil and transferring them to a skid tank to be bottled as 2kg and 5kg and sold for higher prices.\n\nHe said four locals and a foreigner, suspected to be an Indonesian, between the age of 30 and 50, identified as the owners of the premises were arrested to assist in the investigation.\n\nHe added that two lorries, a skid tank, forklift, cut 1kg plastic packets and bottles of cooking oil used to make the transfer were confiscated.

earnings in the second half of the financial year 2021 (2H21), underpinned by higher exports volume and refining margins.\n\nCGS-CIMB Securities Sdn Bhd analysts Nagulan Ravi and Ivy Ng Lee Fang, in a research report, stated that MSM have rightly hedged 99% of its financial year 2021 forecast (FY21F) domestic wholesale raw sugar requirement at US$0.13 (RM0.55) to US$0.14 per pounds (lbs) and 43% of its FY22F requirement at US$0.15-0.16/lbs.\n\nLast year\u2019s raw sugar price averaged at US$0.13-0.14/lbs.\n\n\u201cThis bodes well for MSM given raw sugar prices have been trending higher over the past 18 months to US$0.185/lbs currently, due to supply disruptions in Brazil and Thailand,\u201d the analysts stated in the report yesterday, following a recent update from the company\u2019s management.\n\nThe analysts stated that MSM expects a 10% year-on-year (YoY) growth in its domestic sales volumes in FY21F and has raised its average selling prices (ASPs) for both the wholesale (up to the maximum ceiling price of RM2.69 per kg) and industry segments.\n\nThe higher ASPs and sales volumes would help boost MSM\u2019s domestic refining margins in 2H21F, they added.\n\nRavi and Ng further stated that MSM had secured export contracts worth 65% to 70% of its original 300,000MT export sales target for FY21F.\n\n\u201cThe group is now optimistic of delivering close to 350,000MT of export sales in FY21F, in line with our forecast of 340,000MT, which is a 25% YoY growth versus FY20,\u201d Ravi and Ng added.\n\nThey said the higher export volumes would be driven by stronger demand from its largest export destination, Vietnam, which accounts for around 50% of its exports, and other countries that have reopened from Covid-19 restrictions.\n\nIncreased demand for its value-added products such as liquid sugar, fine syrup and premix products could increase volumes.\n\nThe analysts viewed exports growth would lower refining costs at the group\u2019s refinery in Johor.\n\n\u201cPost the optimisation of its Johor refinery, MSM expects to achieve a 50% utilisation factor (UF) for its Johor refinery in 2H21.\n\n\u201cWe project the Johor refinery could return to the black in FY22F as we project a 52% UF for the year, driven by higher exports volumes,\u201d Ravi and Ng added.\n\nCGS-CIMB forecast MSM to deliver Ebitda margins of 10.9% to 12.4% in FY21-23F, led by higher domestic and export margins and more robust export volumes.\n\n\u201cWe raise our FY21-23F earnings per share forecast by 1.5% to 6.9% to reflect lower refining costs and higher export premiums.\n\n\u201cIn light of this, we raise our target price (TP) to RM1.69 based on a price/net tangible asset (P/ NTA) of 1.2 times (one standard deviation below MSM\u2019s 10-year average P/NTA) versus one time previously,\u201d the analysts wrote.\n\nThe brokerage firm also upgraded MSM to \u2018Add\u2019 as the stock offers a 25% upside to its TP and attractive dividend yields of 6.1% to 7.5% in FY21-23F.\n\nFurther key catalysts include potential equity placements to collaborative partners and the completion of the sale of MSM Perlis, which will allow the MSM group to book a one-off gain from the disposal of the land of RM91.6 million at 13 sen per share.\n\nThe analysts attributed key risks to lower export margins and rising raw sugar prices.\n\nMSM is currently working on doubling its liquid sugar facility\u2019s capacity and enhancing its fine syrup facility due to the rising demand for these products.\n\nIn the longer term, the \u201cGula Prai\u201d producer plans to expand its export segment further by increasing its regional presence in the Asia-Pacific region and establishing a local presence in countries such as China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Singapore, Indonesia and South Korea.\n\nAs of 2019, MSM corroborated up to 60% of the domestic market share and ranked the eighth largest sugar refiner globally by capacity.\n\nMSM share price declined 2.22% to RM1.32 yesterday, valuing the company RM927.93 million.", "keyword": ["export", "earnings", "sugar", "poised", "2h", "higher", "domestic", "volumes", "refining", "msm", "stated", "sales", "stronger",

integrated nature of the Asean\u2019s supply chain, the impact from Vietnam\u2019s Covid-19 woes which culminated in the extension of lockdown measures under the government\u2019s Directive 16 in various provinces in the south are felt by Malaysian businesses that have a presence there.\n\nThe directive stipulates the closure of non-essential businesses, ban on public gatherings and severely limited transport services, in an attempt to contain the wave of Covid Delta variant infections.\n\nIn the past, Vietnam enjoyed success in containing the pandemic attributed to prompt border closure and lockdown measures, as well as an extensive testing and contact tracing strategy.\n\nVietnam recorded 8,324 new Covid-19 cases on Friday, according to the country\u2019s Ministry of Health. The new infections brought the total tally to 193,381, with 3,016 deaths, the ministry said.\n\nCurrently, 19 southern localities in the country, including Ho Chi Minh City, have implemented a lockdown via Directive 16 until Aug 16. Meanwhile, The lockdown in Hanoi, Vietnam\u2019s capital, has been extended by 15 days until Aug 22.\n\nAs a result, a number of Bursa Malaysia-listed issuers with facilities in Vietnam have reported suspension of operations there.\n\nYBS International Bhd\n\nIts subsidiary, Oriental Fastech Manufacturing (Vietnam), which is involved in high precision metal fabrication and assembly, is partially suspending its operations to comply with the government\u2019s directive.\n\nMagni-Tech Industries Bhd\n\nIts garment production facilities in Vietnam have been suspended in line with the government\u2019s directive. The group is mitigating the impact of the closure via close engagement with its customers to manage the production capacity challenges as well as rescheduling delivery dates to meet customer\u2019s demand. It is assessing the impact of the closure on its financial performance and announcements will be made if there is any material development.\n\nPoh Huat Resources Holdings Bhd\n\nThe group\u2019s subsidiary, Poh Huat Furniture Industries Vietnam Joint Stock Co, which has factories in Binh Duong Province and Dong Nai Province, has halted production activities in line with the lockdown order. As of July 21, it said none of its employees in the two locations has exhibited any Covid-19 symptoms and it will undertake screening and quarantine measures should any employee exhibit symptoms or be confirmed positive of the virus.\n\nConsequently, the production interruption is expected to cause delay in the shipment of orders to its customers in the US. Poh Huat\u2019s management is in discussions with affected customers to reschedule their delivery dates for affected orders. It said it is able to mitigate some of the impact from the closure as it has a certain amount of ready inventory to meet the orders and it will increase production with extended shifts upon resumption of production activities, if necessary.\n\nLatitude Tree Holdings Bhd\n\nTwo of the group\u2019s subsidiaries, Latitude Tree Vietnam Joint Stock Co and RK Resources Co Ltd, are partially suspending operations to comply with Vietnam\u2019s Directive 16.

This approach will allow it to operate at a reduced production capacity.\n\nLatitude Tree estimates the production loss from the \u20183 on the spot\u2019 approach to be around 1.2% to 1.8% of its total forecast annual output volume for FY2022.\n\n", "keyword": ["fallout", "grapple", "lockdown", "directive", "tree", "firms", "16", "vietnams", "production", "vietnam", "bursalisted", "closure", "customers", "covid", "impact", "presence", "malaysian"], "summary": "In the past, Vietnam enjoyed success in containing the pandemic attributed to prompt border closure and lockdown measures, as well as an extensive testing and contact tracing strategy.\nCurrently, 19 southern localities in the country, including Ho Chi Minh City, have implemented a lockdown via Directive 16 until Aug 16.\nAs a result, a number of Bursa Malaysia-listed issuers with facilities in Vietnam have reported suspension of operations there.\nMagni-Tech Industries BhdIts garment production facilities in Vietnam have been suspended in line with the government\u2019s directive.\nLatitude Tree Holdings BhdTwo of the group\u2019s subsidiaries, Latitude Tree Vietnam Joint Stock Co and RK Resources Co Ltd, are partially suspending operations to comply with Vietnam\u2019s Directive 16.", "news": "The Sun Daily", "date": "2021-08-08 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Introduce code of ethics for elected reps \u2013 Rais", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWJvcm5lb3Bvc3QuY29tLzIwMjEvMDgvMDcvaW50cm9kdWNlLWNvZGUtb2YtZXRoaWNzLWZvci1lbGVjdGVkLXJlcHMtcmFpcy_SAQA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2021/07/FW1176796_KL19_19072021_DEWAN-lpr.jpg", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR (Aug 7): Dewan Negara president Tan Sri Dr Rais Yatim has suggested that a code of ethics for elected representatives be introduced to members of Parliament and assemblymen to make them respected and exemplary leaders.\n\nIn his writing in the Journal of the Malaysian Parliament entitled \u2018Etika Legislatif untuk Wakil Rakyat\u2019 (Legislative Ethics for Elected Representatives), he said the code of ethics was also important to \u2018control\u2019 and \u2018discipline\u2019 elected representatives when taking part in debate sessions.\n\nRais said since Parliament is a place where the country\u2019s leaders are born, members must also consist of those with qualified academic qualifications and are well mannered.\n\nHowever, he said, in reality and based on the Parliament Hansard, the behavior, speech and debating style of elected representatives in the Malaysian Parliament was moving backward, he said, referring to the speech by three MPs who used offensive language in 2018.\n\nTherefore, Rais said changes in internal and external legislative work should be initiated, including the introduction of a code of ethics for the elected representatives that can be enforced in accordance with the Houses of Parliament (Privileges and Powers) Act 1952 (Act 347) or through the setting up of a special committee under Dewan Rakyat, Dewan Negara or state legislative assemblies.\n\nFor Dewan Negara, he said the motion to establish the code of ethics for elected representatives can be made under Standing Order 13 (2) 31 of the Senate.\n\nRais also suggested that training courses be given to MPs and assemblymen to ensure that they become elected representatives with integrity and have extensive legal knowledge.\n\n\u201cMake it mandatory for all elected representatives to undergo at least six months of training.

We propose postponing the relaxation to a time determined by a clear set of publicised criteria,\u201d Malaysia Health Coalition (MHC) said in a statement yesterday.\n\nThe coalition of medical experts added that at the moment, only 27% of the population of all ages were fully vaccinated, and this excludes undocumented migrants.\n\n\u201cChile only relaxed restrictions after 50% coverage, and Singapore is targeting relaxed restrictions at 70% coverage,\u201d MHC added.\n\nOn Sunday, Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin announced that among the restrictions being lifted for fully vaccinated individuals who reside in states under Phase 2 and above of the National Recovery Plan (NRP), include dine-ins, inter-district travel, sports and recreational activities without physical contact as well as tourism activities within the state involving homestays and hotels.\n\n\u201cIn allowing the relaxation, the government will also ensure public health strategic plans, which are now on the right track, continue to be implemented, especially through screenings, close contact detection, isolation measures, as well as improving healthcare capacity and treatment options,\u201d he said.\n\nMHC, however, stated that scientific and public health criteria for relaxation must be built by health experts without interference.\n\n\u201cThey can include \u2018fully vaccinated rate \u226570% of the total population, total critical care bed occupancy rate for Covid-19 of \u226490%, total daily new cases \u22644000 with share of positive tests \u22645%\u2019 and other criteria. These criteria must be publicised so that any future decisions will be solely based on evidence,\u201d MHC explained.\n\nAdditionally, the coalition said the government should clarify the specifics of these relaxed restrictions, because blanket vaccine privileges will create loopholes that will impede NRP.\n\n\u201cFor example, the government must answer questions like: What is the rationale to allow home quarantine for vaccinated travellers, how long is the quarantine and how will we monitor? How do we close the loopholes that may allow \u2018inter-state vacations on the pretext of visiting our children?\u2019\u201d it said.\n\nMeanwhile, Malaysian Medical Association (MMA) president Datuk Dr Subramaniam Muniandy said the decision to relax restrictions must be supported with sufficient scientific evidence.\n\n\u201cIf it is indeed a decision based on science, why then is travel allowed for those wishing to see their spouse or their young children? Either it\u2019s sufficiently safe for the fully vaccinated to travel, in which case all vaccinated individuals should be allowed to do so, or it is not, in which nobody should travel,\u201d he said.\n\nHe noted that some of those states in Phase 2 are showing an increasing trend in Covid-19 cases.\n\n\u201cThe government should stop its hyping up on the total number of cases. What is important are hospital bed utilisation and the intensive care units (ICUs) situation in the country,\u201d Dr Subramaniam said.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, we hope that the government will provide an update on the positivity rate and the status of bed utilisation and ICUs in each state as these will be more meaningful indicators apart from the daily new cases. It is important that the public be kept informed of the bed capacity and ICUs status in their respective state,\u201d he added.\n\nMMA also said that the lifting of restrictions must also take into account high-risk groups such as nursing homes, factory and construction workers, security guards, cleaners, medical students and undocumented migrant workers that have not been vaccinated.",

skin and hair.\n\nETX Daily Up is focussing on a few that should help convince you to either concoct your own treatments, or embrace some of the numerous cosmetic formulations based on this precious ingredient.\n\nCaffeine, an active ingredient that shouldn\u2019t be ignored\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon to find cosmetics formulated with caffeine, an active ingredient known for its slimming and firming benefits.\n\nGenerally, it is found in creams, gels, and other beauty products designed to help lose a few centimetres on the hips, thighs, or buttocks, as well as in anti-cellulite products or formulations designed to help users improve toning or firmness.\n\nBut caffeine is also present in certain facial care products, again with the aim of fighting skin slackening, but also \u2013 and above all \u2013 to improve the appearance of the eye contour area and reduce puffiness and dark circles (it can be even more effective if the product has spent some time in the refrigerator).\n\nCreams, gels, masks, cleansers: caffeine is nowadays found in products at all price points in the cosmetic departments of department stores and specialised shops.\n\nIn the form of powder and grounds\n\nWith the advent of DIY beauty, coffee now shows up in many so-called \u201chomemade\u201d recipes in the form of powder or grounds.\n\nRich in caffeine, these formulations can offer the advantages mentioned above, but are also powerful antioxidants, which allows them to fight against certain effects seen on mature skins, and more generally against skin aging.\n\nIn addition to these inherent virtues, coffee grounds, thanks to their specific texture, also make for a great exfoliant for sloughing off dead cells.\n\nAll you need to do is mix it with other ingredients: egg white for a mask, vegetable oil and honey for a face and body scrub, or even on its own to exfoliate scalp and hair to make it shinier.\n\nOver on TikTok, known for being the go-to social network for DIY beauty recipes, one can also discover a multitude of recipes for masks and scrubs made from soluble coffee or coffee beans.\n\nRecipes that users seem to have not only tested but also

collaborating with GE Digital on aircraft fuel efficiency monitoring solutions as part of the carrier\u2019s initiatives to meet its sustainability goals.\n\nThe national flag carrier adopted GE Digital\u2019s Fuel Insight and FlightPulse aviation software to transform and modernise the airline\u2019s fuel efficiency programme.\n\nMAB has implemented various initiatives including efficiency measures, investments in sustainability solutions and waste reduction across its operations to address its sustainability goals.\n\nThe fuel efficiency programme has been running for over a decade, contributing to a 15% fuel burn improvement recorded over the past eight years.\n\nMAB\u2019s group operations officer, Ahmad Luqman Mohd Azmi, stated promoting sustainability in all of the MAB\u2019s operations has always been a top priority.\n\nHe said digitalisation is a core component of the airlines\u2019 long term business plan and such efforts bring immediate value especially in the area of fuel efficiency.\n\n\u201cWe are looking forward to such a partnership that contributes to the airline\u2019s efforts to accelerate our sustainability target.\n\n\u201cThrough these solutions, we seek to play a greater part in building a legacy for future generations and enhancing our own airline\u2019s sustainability efforts,\u201d Ahmad Luqman said in a statement yesterday.\n\nFuel Insight is a cost and emissions monitoring solution that works by understanding data from the aircraft to uncover valuable intelligence that helps increase fuel efficiency and reduce waste.\n\nIt also gives operators actionable intelligence at multiple levels allowing analysts to drill down macro trends to understand issues on a per-flight level.\n\nThe software uses GE Digital\u2019s Event Measurement System (EMS) aviation data and analytics platform to merge flight data with flight plans, load sheets and fuel uplift data, identify the most attainable fuel savings opportunities, and track the incremental savings across the operation.\n\nFlightPulse, meanwhile, puts data directly into the hands of pilots, allowing them to visualise their savings over time.\n\nPilots who understand their own performance can adjust their flight plans to maximise safety and fuel efficiency.\n\nSecure benchmarking and data sharing allows crew members to see their contribution to projects and dramatically shortens the feedback loop.\n\nMAB evaluated the software with an extensive team of pilots, dispatchers and analysts who endorsed the software solution, which is hosted on GE Digital\u2019s EMS platform.\n\nEMS is built on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform providing compute, data, and security services.\n\nGE Digital\u2019s GM of the aviation software business Andrew Coleman said the company is committed to environmental excellence and that includes ensuring its customers are empowered to reduce the impact of their technology and environmental footprint within their operations.\n\n\u201cThese solutions will help MAB to leverage software to improve efficiency and reduce carbon emissions,\u201d Coleman added.\n\nThe solution will be implemented by the GE Digital aviation software teams in Austin, Texas and Shanghai, China.\n\nAdditionally, GE Digital provides MAB with the tools to build its big data analytics and leverage modern tools for data analysis

But fans in Malaysia have something to look forward to as two locals are working on a real-life version of the game \u2013 and this time, you can finally taste your veggies.\n\nWith the help of artificial intelligence and, in the near future, drones, Aquaville Asia hopes to become the world\u2019s first aquaponics farm where subscribers can nurture actual crops through their phones.\n\nFeeling like kale this week but kangkung the next? No problem, just tap on your screen and come harvest day, you will be greeted at your doorstep with fresh greens harvested from your own aquaponic plot.\n\nThat\u2019s the plan, at least \u2013 but for the time being, the concept is already in motion where subscribers can get five packs of vegetables delivered four times a month, with optional tilapia fish.\n\nAquaville founder Chia Weng Yan tells FMT that the idea came to him in the middle of the night. \u201cI dreamt about it and jotted down \u2018FarmVille in real life\u2019,\u201d the 40-year-old says.\n\n\u201cI created a pitch deck for it thinking it was a great idea, but didn\u2019t execute it and kept it on my computer for a long time,\u201d he adds, explaining that he struggled to find someone with the technological know-how to make his literal dream a reality.\n\nThen, in July last year, Chia found the perfect person for the job.\n\nLoke Chung Eng had posted on Facebook about robotics and projects involving IOT, or \u201cinternet of things\u201d, a network of physical objects embedded with sensors, software and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data.\n\nA phone call later and Chia had joined forces with Loke, 33, to create Aquaville Asia. The duo worked for months on the concept.\n\nWhile Loke spent time programming the AI system, Chia reached out to urban farmers, friends and family members to get them on board.\n\nThe duo forged an alliance with AHA Services Malaysia, a farm run by urban agriculturalists who provide Aquaville with all their farming requirements, including maintenance, harvest and delivery of fresh produce to subscribers.\n\nChia and Loke leave the farming to these experts and do their share by equipping the farm with Aquaville\u2019s AI technology.\n\n\u201cWe provide them with smart-farm capabilities so if any subscriptions come in, they are ready to harvest and deliver the produce,\u201d Chia explains.\n\nHe adds that using AI, Loke created a way to spot diseases in crops using an NDVI camera that scans vegetables at different wavelengths \u201cso you know if they are dying ahead of time\u201d.\n\nThe AI system can even monitor pH levels, humidity, heat and water levels. All their crops are pesticide-free.\n\nAquaville was officially launched in January this year, and subscribers have been effusive about how lush and crisp their vegetables are, compared with those bought in a store.\n\nSome customers have also funnelled their harvests to the needy, among them three companies that donated to a special-needs home in Petaling Jaya \u2013 sending bundles of fresh greens to feed 74 children between January and June \u2013 as well as contributed towards the white flag movement.\n\nIn the near future, Chia and Loke aim to introduce an application and drone system that will swoop over crops and capture real-time footage. Subscribers will be able to monitor their greens and control them through the app.\n\nAdditionally, the duo hope to empower the less fortunate and provide deaf, mute and B40 families with job opportunities on the farm.\n\nIt may take a few years for this FarmVille dream to fully become a reality, but the Aquaville innovators are hopeful and looking forward to a bright and greener future.\n\nFor fresh produce at your door each week or to help the needy, contact Aquaville Asia via Facebook or check out their website.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["taste", "malaysias", "veggies", "provide", "ai", "loke", "crops", "system", "chia", "aquaville", "farmville", "subscribers", "fresh", "vegetables"], "summary": "PETALING JAYA: Thousands were left cropless and devastated last year when Zynga\u2019s popular game FarmVille announced the end of its 11-year legacy.\nBut fans in Malaysia have something to look forward to as two locals are working on a real-life version of the game \u2013 and this time, you can finally taste your veggies.\nAquaville founder Chia Weng Yan tells FMT that the idea came to him in the middle of the night.\nWhile Loke spent time programming the AI system, Chia reached out to urban farmers, friends and family members to get them on board.\nThe AI system can even monitor pH levels, humidity, heat and water levels.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-08-12 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "1989 Proton Black Knight Wins \u201cUnexceptional\u201d Award In UK Car Festival", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL2Z1bi8yMDIxLzA4LzAzLzE5ODktcHJvdG9uLWJsYWNrLWtuaWdodC13aW5zLXVuZXhjZXB0aW9uYWwtYXdhcmQtaW4tdWstY2FyLWZlc3RpdmFsL9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL2Z1bi8yMDIxLzA4LzAzLzE5ODktcHJvdG9uLWJsYWNrLWtuaWdodC13aW5zLXVuZXhjZXB0aW9uYWwtYXdhcmQtaW4tdWstY2FyLWZlc3RpdmFsL2FtcC8?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Azizul Rahman Ismail", "Maya Suraya"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Proton-Black-Knight.jpeg", "text": "Subscribe to our new Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates.\n\nThe Proton Saga is Malaysia\u2019s first car and was the symbol of the nation\u2019s success. It says so in the jingle, if you are old enough to remember it.\n\nIntroduced in 1985, the name Saga was theorised to have a double meaning.\n\nIn English, it is defined as a long story of heroic achievement.\n\nIn Malay, it refers to the Adenanthera tree. The colour of its bright and deep red seeds was the inspiration for the signature hue of the national car.\n\nHowever, the reality is, the name \u201cSaga\u201d was the winning entry in a competition held in 1984.\n\nThe winner, Staf Sarjan Ismail Jaafar said that the name is actually an acronym for Safety, Achievement, Greatness, and Ability.\n\nThey Don\u2019t Make Them Like They Used To\n\nThe first generation Saga had many iterations and was in production up to 1992.\n\nOne of its most notable versions of the Saga was a hatchback released in 1987 during the peak of popularity of a certain TV show starring a certain modified Pontiac Trans Am.\n\nThe hatchback was called the Proton Knight. It was later named Proton Saga Aeroback, perhaps for copyright reasons.

Lots of things are being said,\u201d he said as PSG laboured to a 2-1 win over Troyes in their opening game of the new league season.\n\nJorge Sampaoli, the Argentine coach of PSG\u2019s bitter rivals Marseille, said the arrival of Messi can only be good news for French football.\n\n\u201cIt would be great for Ligue 1, he\u2019s the best player in the world,\u201d said Sampaoli.\n\n\u201cFrench football has won a lot and grown a lot in recent seasons.\n\n\u201cEven if he goes to a club other than Marseille, it will be good.

year\u2019s Merdeka will be like no other, courtesy of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nWith most of the Klang Valley and other urban centres under strict lockdown, the usual display of patriotic sentiments will be somewhat drowned out by the pervasive gloom of the moment.\n\nYet, 27 artists have chosen to express their love for the country during the month of Merdeka by displaying their works in an online exhibition titled very simply \u201cJalur Gemilang\u201d.\n\nOpen for viewing until the end of the month, the exhibition is hosted by Artas Galeri, an art gallery based in Petaling Jaya.\n\nAccording to Roy Ng, Artas Galeri\u2019s director, plans were already underway to hold a physical Merdeka-themed exhibition in the months leading up to August.\n\nHowever, with the extension of MCO 3.0, it became painfully clear that Plan B would have to be executed.\n\n\u201cDue to the pandemic and the increasing number of cases, I decided to launch an online show with an e-catalogue instead,\u201d he said.\n\nThat way, art enthusiasts will still be able to view the art pieces themselves without leaving the safety of their homes.\n\n\u201cMost of these artists\u2019 works exhibited in the \u2018Jalur Gemilang\u2019 exhibition are based on our national flag\u2019s colours,\u201d Ng said, adding that a majority of them used copious amounts of red, yellow, blue and white in multiple art styles including abstract, still-life and figurative.\n\nAccording to him, the artists are a fascinating group made up of graduates fresh out of art school as well as senior artists who have made a name for themselves in the art world.\n\nFMT had the pleasure of interviewing six of the artists regarding their hopes for the country this Merdeka month.\n\nYuki Lim Xiao Mun, artist of the almost ethereal \u201cThe Paradise Land\u201d, had this to say: \u201cMy hope for this Merdeka month is that our country can be restored to good condition after the economic hardship caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nShe said it was also her sincere hope that Malaysia\u2019s leaders will lead the country down the right path by practising integrity in their leadership.\n\nLikewise, Fadzril Fakaruddin encouraged Malaysians to stay united no matter what the circumstances, so that together, they could be free of Covid-19 for good.\n\nWhile Hamir Soib hopes for better governance, fellow artist Najib Ahmad Bamadhaj is hopeful for a return to normalcy and the good \u2018ol pre-Covid days.\n\nNational unity is something that veteran artist, Awang Damit, believes is vital if the country is to survive these difficult times.\n\nAnd another artist, Zulkefli Talha, reminded Malaysians to love each other as fellow countrymen regardless of racial or religious differences.\n\n\u201cLeaders have to be good examples for the people. And both leaders and the people have to work together to end this pandemic and return Malaysia to its former glory.\u201d\n\nNg told FMT that the pandemic had been especially tough on many artists. The numerous lockdowns this past year and a half meant potential buyers were unable to view the artworks personally and as a consequence, there was little to no sales.\n\nHe said there was an urgent need for artists to find alternative avenues to display their work so that they could continue to earn a decent living.\n\nNg explained that things have not been looking up for artists for a while now. Prior to the pandemic, the sluggish economy meant artists struggled to make a sale. The lockdowns brought about by the pandemic, only made things worse.\n\n\u201cMost collectors and buyers prefer to see the pieces in person. There\u2019s a huge difference between seeing artworks personally and virtually,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen you view an artwork physically, you will be able to see the texture, notice the colour tones and spot the little details. That\u2019s something these virtual exhibitions sadly cannot offer.\u201d\n\nHowever, this has not dampened the spirit of art collectors such as Brendan Siva in regard to the \u201cJalur Gemilang\u201d exhibition.\n\n\u201cEach piece is unique as an individual interpretation and expression of what Malaysia represents and symbolises in the eyes of the artist.

So it\u2019s just like dance.\u201d\n\nEach scene will be discussed and rehearsed beforehand, away from the glare of the dozens of people usually present on a set.\n\n\u201cWhen the camera rolls or they\u2019re up on stage, they know they can perform that intimate contact, knowing where they\u2019re going to be touched,\u201d she says.\n\nAt the heart of her philosophy is consent, in an industry which has been rocked in recent years by sexual assault claims. Her motto, which she says she often repeats to actors, is: \u201cYour \u2018no\u2019 is a gift. Tell us your \u2018no\u2019, so that we can trust your \u2018yes'\u201d.\n\n\u2018Incredibly hard\u2019\n\nO\u2019Brien was a dancer in the theatre for 10 years and then an actress for eight before she sensed an opportunity and became an intimacy coordinator in 2014.\n\nIt was a pioneering move at a time when actors\u2019 consent was little talked about, and before the #MeToo movement against sexual abuse and sexual harassment.\n\nBefore then, \u201cif an actor ever said \u2018no\u2019, they\u2019d be a troublemaker or a diva, and they would certainly be worried about losing their job,\u201d she recalls.\n\nIn such an environment, she describes her early days in the role as \u201cincredibly hard\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had productions where I\u2019ve been told not to speak to the director,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m serving the director\u2019s vision, but the director doesn\u2019t want to speak to me because he\u2019s a 74-year-old man, who basically doesn\u2019t want to acknowledge my existence.\u201d\n\nOn other occasions, she was not allowed on the set because the actors or director did not want her help.\n\nAttitudes have since changed a lot. The profession is becoming more popular and O\u2019Brien is in high demand, especially after Michaela Coel dedicated her best actress BAFTA win this year for \u201cI May Destroy You\u201d to her.\n\n\u201cThank you, Ita, for making a space safe, for creating physical, emotional and professional boundaries, so we can make work about exploitation, loss of respect, about abuse of powers, without being exploited or abused in the process,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["stars", "sexual", "ita", "obrien", "indemand", "intimacy", "process", "coordinator", "scenes", "sex", "actor",

Covid jabs per day and are moving towards increasing to 20,000 doses per day. \u2014 Picture by Sayuti Zainudin\n\nFollow us on Instagram and subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates.\n\nGEORGE TOWN, Aug 1 \u2014 Factories and small businesses in Penang, especially those hard hit by disruptions due to the Covid-19 pandemic, are looking forward to resuming operations as soon as possible even if it means making vaccination mandatory for their workers.\n\nAs there are currently no laws to enforce mandatory Covid-19 vaccination on workers, some companies are taking steps to get their workers to register for vaccination.\n\nPenang Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM) chairman Datuk Jimmy Ong said most factories here are encouraging their workers to register for their Covid jabs through various methods.\n\n\u201cSome companies are giving paid leave to their workers to go for vaccination and some are even offering monetary rewards,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the main reason multinational companies (MNC) are setting up Program Imunisasi Industri Covid-19 Kerjasama Awam-Swasta (Pikas) vaccination centres within their own factory grounds is to encourage their workers to get vaccinated.\n\nHe said the Pikas PPVs in Penang are now dispensing 15,000 doses per day and are moving towards increasing to 20,000 doses per day.\n\nHe said the vaccination of workers in MNCs is progressing very fast due to the on-site PPVs for larger factories which employ thousands of workers.\n\n\u201cIt is slower for small medium enterprises as they can only send their workers to the Pikas PPVs and there are only two of those now; one in Jawi and one at Equatorial Hotel,\u201d he said.\n\nEven with vaccination in full force, Ong said some of the companies in the manufacturing sector have continued to conduct screening of workers every two to three weeks.\n\n\u201cScreening still has to continue to control any potential spread of cases within the factories because we know, even those vaccinated still have a risk of contracting Covid-19,\u201d he said.\n\nFMM Penang branch offers a Penang SAFE programme for factories to conduct screening tests for its workers at a lower rate of RM60 per person.\n\nOng said the programme recommends that any company taking up the package conduct screening of 100 per cent of its staff in the first round.\n\n\u201cAfter that, they can conduct screening on 20 per cent of their staff for the second round and another 20 per cent on the third round, and so on,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, one of the SMEs in Penang, Chemdyes Sdn Bhd, has checked labour laws on ways to compel its employees to get vaccinated.\n\nThe company\u2019s managing director Joe Sidek said it was informed that there are at present no laws for the company to compel its employees to register for vaccination.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t legally force them to register for vaccination, it is a personal right, so what we do is to encourage them to do it as a way to safeguard everyone\u2019s safety in the workplace,\u201d he said.\n\nThe factory, specialising in textile chemicals, has about 22 workers and Joe said all have registered for vaccination.\n\nA nurse administers a dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at the Pikas vaccination centre at the Bukit Jawi Golf Resort in Penang June 17, 2021. \u2014 Picture by Sayuti Zainudin\n\nHe said despite the downturn in the textile industry due to the pandemic, Chemdyes recorded stable revenue last year and expects an increase in revenue this year.\n\n\u201cWe have kept all our staff and did not cut any pay so we have been very fortunate and we want to ensure that everyone is safe, we do not want to have any cases that could disrupt production,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said he would allow his workers to stay home for a week and to undergo screening tests if they have been exposed to places with a high number of Covid-19 cases.\n\nMeanwhile, it was reported that the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) is considering making vaccination of all employees in the retail sector one of the pre-conditions for approval for companies to resume operation, during the National Recovery Plan (NRP) period.\n\nYin\u2019s Sourdough Bakery and cafe co-founder Ong Seng Keat has already made it compulsory for all of its 40 workers to sign up for vaccination.\n\n\u201cWe will check our workers\u2019 MySejahtera to make sure they have registered and if we have to pay for it, we will,\u201d he said.\n\nHis company has already paid for all of his workers in Klang Valley to be vaccinated under a retail industry vaccination programme.\n\nHe hopes such programmes will be available in Penang so he can send all his workers to be vaccinated as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cThe government really needs to speed up its vaccination programme for the economic frontliners because we deal with people every day,\u201d he said.\n\nMugshot Cafe co-founder Jesse Tan agrees with Ong that vaccination for economic frontliners should be sped up.\n\n\u201cSo far, all of our staff have registered for vaccination but they are still waiting for their appointments,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of Mugshot\u2019s staff contracted Covid-19 a few months back due to close contact with a relative but fortunately, it did not spread to the other staff in the cafe.\n\n\u201cThere are 15 of us in the cafe and all of us went for screening the moment we found out he was positive but luckily, we were all negative,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the incident further emphasises the importance of vaccination for all workers who deal with customers daily.\n\nAs for Hin Bus Depot manager Tan Shih Thoe, he is also considering only allowing fully vaccinated vendors to participate in the Hin Bus Depot weekly bazaar, when they are finally allowed to reopen.\n\n\u201cI was just thinking about this, especially for the market, whether I should only allow vendors who are fully vaccinated to participate... main consideration is their safety since the market is considered a crowded space,\u201d he said.\n\nThere used to be 70 vendors at the weekly market before the pandemic but due to standard operating procedures (SOPs), the number of vendors came down to around 55 each week.\n\nThe market has been closed for more than two months due to the movement control order (MCO) and subsequent phases of the NRP.\n\nHin Bus Depot has around 15 tenants, consisting of eateries and artisans, and Tan said he will also strongly encourage the tenants and their workers to register for vaccination.\n\n\u201cMost of them are in favour of vaccination as they see it as the only solution to things getting back to normal,\u201d he said.\n\nFurry Kids pet shop owner Dalbinder Singh also agrees that it is important for those in the retail sector to be vaccinated.\n\n\u201cWe are meeting people and customers daily so it is important for the safety of everyone,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, he said it would be infringing on the individual\u2019s human rights to force workers to register for vaccination so he can only encourage them to do so.\n\n\u201cFortunately, all of my staff have registered but they are still waiting... I am also still waiting for my appointment,\u201d he said.\n\nHe too said vaccination for retail workers should be sped up since they face customers daily.", "keyword": ["register", "vaccination", "manufacturing", "ong", "pikas", "workers", "services", "support", "staff", "sectors", "employers", "screening", "mandate", "covid19", "vaccinated", "penang", "vaccine"], "summary": "As there are currently no laws to enforce mandatory Covid-19 vaccination on workers, some companies are taking steps to get their workers to register for vaccination.\nPenang Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM) chairman Datuk Jimmy Ong said most factories here are encouraging their workers to register for their Covid jabs through various methods.\nHe said the vaccination of workers in MNCs is progressing very fast due to the on-site PPVs for larger factories which employ thousands of workers.\nFMM Penang branch offers a Penang SAFE programme for factories to conduct screening tests for its workers at a lower rate of RM60 per person.\nA nurse administers a dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at the Pikas vaccination centre at the Bukit Jawi Golf Resort in Penang June 17, 2021.", "news": "Malay Mail", "date": "2021-08-01 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Can employers make COVID-19 vaccinations mandatory for all staff?

Here\u2019s what you need to know:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Can employers make vaccination compulsory for employees?\n\nEmployment lawyer Donovan Cheah said there is no law now that disallows mandatory vaccination policies by employers, and that there are no known court cases in the country about whether such a policy would be legal.\n\n\u201cGiven the severity of the pandemic, having a mandatory vaccination policy is one of the ways for employers to safeguard the safety and health of their employees and curb the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cHowever, there are no reported court cases in Malaysia about the legality of mandatory vaccination policies, and whether an employer can take disciplinary action against an employee for refusing to vaccinate,\u201d he said, but noted there have been reported cases in countries like Australia and the US which upheld the dismissal of employees who refuse to comply with their employer\u2019s mandatory vaccination policy.\n\nSpecialist employment lawyer Marcus van Geyzel said employers would generally be able to make it compulsory for their employees to undergo COVID-19 vaccination if this is due to a government-imposed requirement.\n\n\u201cYes, if the MDTCA/KPDNHEP makes employee vaccinations mandatory or a pre-condition for approval to operate, the affected employers can impose this requirement on employees,\u201d he told Malay Mail.\n\n\u201cHowever, employers should be cautious where there are special circumstances, such as where an employee is unable to receive a vaccination due to a medical condition,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIn general, it would be very unlikely for an employee to successfully challenge an employer\u2019s mandatory vaccination policy where vaccinations have been declared a pre-condition for operations by the government.\n\nIn order to bring a successful legal action, an employee would have to show that in mandating vaccination, the employer has exercised its managerial power in a non-genuine manner, or that there was victimisation or an unfair labour practice,\u201d he said.\n\n2. What if the employees say no to vaccination?\n\nCheah said employers can choose to take disciplinary action against employees who refuse vaccination, and that whether such action is reasonable depends on the situation.\n\n\u201cWhile an employer cannot physically compel an employee to take the vaccine, an employee\u2019s freedom of choice is not the same thing as freedom from consequences. There are no legal prohibitions against an employer implementing a mandatory vaccination policy, although how employers deal with breaches of this policy may be evaluated by the courts,\u201d he said.\n\nCheah said disciplinary action including dismissal may be seen as reasonable, taking into account various factors.\n\nHe listed examples such as the employee\u2019s reason for refusal; whether the employee\u2019s refusal amounts to a breach of their duties or has caused loss or damage to the company or other employees; whether the employee\u2019s job function requires him/her to have regular and frequent physical interaction with third parties.\n\nOther factors listed by Cheah are the current severity of the pandemic; whether the employer\u2019s business deals with high-risk individuals; and whether vaccination is a pre-condition from the authorities for the employer to operate.\n\n\u201cWhere an employee has a legitimate reason to refuse vaccination (eg: health condition), employers should explore other ways to address the risk, such as requiring them to carry out their duties remotely and not allowing them to enter the premises without notice,\u201d Cheah added.\n\nVan Geyzel said employers would have several options, when vaccinations are a precondition for operations but there are employees who refuse to get vaccinated.\n\nThese options are to engage with the employees, or to transfer employees to alternative roles, or to ultimately stop employing the employee.\n\n\u201cThe first step should always be for employers to have clear and open conversations with these employees to ensure that they understand the reason for the vaccination requirement.\n\n\u201cEmployers can also consider redesignating or redeploying the affected employees to other roles within the business which are not customer-facing and which may be exempted from the regulatory requirements,\u201d he said.\n\nIf redesignation and redeployment is not an option, employers would be legally able to terminate the employee\u2019s employment if it is reasonable in the circumstances, he said.\n\nVan Geyzel said there is a general legal expectation that an employee has to follow all lawful and reasonable instructions by the employer.\n\nHe added that it can be argued that an employee is carrying out an act of insubordination by refusing to be vaccinated under the circumstances, as the employee is wilfully disobeying a lawful and reasonable order issued by the employer.\n\n\u201cAny punishment or action by the employer in response to insubordination has to be reasonable or proportionate, and it can be said here that where the result of the employee\u2019s vaccination is that the business would not be allowed to operate, there are serious repercussions and therefore termination of employment is a reasonable response by the employer.\n\n\u201cAnother potential justification for termination of employment is that an unvaccinated employee would be unable to perform the job or service for which the employee was employed. This would be the case if an unvaccinated employee is not permitted by law to work.\n\n\u201cIn such a situation, it may be reasonable for an employer to deem that the employment contract cannot be performed and therefore can be terminated,\u201d he said.\n\n3. What if an employee says no to vaccination due to health conditions?\n\nAs for employees who are unable to receive COVID-19 vaccinations due to a medical condition, van Geyzel said employers could explore measures such as redesignation.\n\n\u201cFirstly, I don\u2019t think the government would make vaccinations mandatory for such employees.\n\n\u201cSecondly, even if the government issued a blanket requirement, the employer should see if it\u2019s possible to apply for an exemption for that employee, or again see if redeployment or redesignation is an option.\n\n\u201cTermination should always be a last resort, but if the employer has acted reasonably, then termination should be possible under the law,\u201d he said, also saying that an employee would be unlikely to succeed in an unfair dismissal claim if an employer treated the employee fairly and could show that the termination was reasonable in the circumstances.\n\nFor employees with pre-existing health conditions that prevent them from being vaccinated, employment lawyer Jayasingam Poopalasingam said employers can seek to take mitigation measures such as changing their work roles or have them work remotely.\n\nHowever, if the nature of the business and nature of the employee\u2019s work requires vaccination, but vaccination is not possible due to the health condition and mitigating measures are not feasible through no fault of both the employer or the employee, the employer may be left with no choice but to terminate employment.\n\nThe employee could under such circumstances file a complaint to claim that the dismissal was without just cause and excuse, but it would ultimately be for the Industrial Court to decide if the dismissal was with just cause and excuse, he said.\n\n4. Putting it into the employment contract and putting it in writing\n\nJayasingam, who is also co-chair of the Bar Council\u2019s Industrial and Employment Law Committee, similarly said there are currently no laws that mandate COVID-19 vaccination for employees.\n\nThis means that for existing employees, an employer cannot \u201cforce\u201d them to be vaccinated, but can only seek to persuade and convince the employee of the need to be vaccinated due to reasons such as the nature of the work.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing much you can do, you cannot force the employee to go for vaccination, you cannot force an employee to undergo a medical procedure, it has to be by way of consent,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf they are existing employees, it must be by way of consent. They have a right to refuse vaccination, that\u2019s why we advise employers to obtain the written consent of employees to be vaccinated,\u201d he said, explaining that a mere verbal consent is not advisable as an employee could later claim to have never given consent.\n\nFor employees who pose a high risk due to the nature of their job as a frontliner or being in contact with others but refuse vaccination, employers can transfer them to another position where they do not deal with customers or other employees, he said.\n\nBut for new employees, an employer can make being vaccinated against COVID-19 a part of the employment contract prior to them joining the company, he said.\n\n\u201cYou cannot force it but what you can do is if you are having new employees, you can put it as a term of the contract, where they must be vaccinated before they are hired for employment, or they must undertake they will be vaccinated after they join you,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the new recruit would have the option of not joining the company upon viewing the contract, while employers can terminate employment if the new hire subsequently does not comply with instructions to be vaccinated as promised under the contract.\n\n5. About legal action\n\nIf an employer forces an employee to undergo COVID-19 vaccination, the employee can possibly walk out of the job and try to claim \u201cconstructive dismissal\u201d, Jayasingam said.\n\nIn cases of constructive dismissal claims, the employer does not have to issue a letter of termination, but the employee is essentially claiming that the employer has done something in breach of his contractual rights and that the employer\u2019s conduct had resulted in the employee\u2019s resignation.\n\nSuch an employee could then seek to prove their case in the Industrial Court to claim for monetary compensation and reinstatement to the job with all previous benefits and rights unaffected, including the right to not be forced to be vaccinated, Jayasingam said. It would ultimately be for the Industrial Court to decide if there was constructive dismissal.\n\nAlternatively, employees can also file a claim in civil courts but this is usually not preferred as the compensation is very small, with most employees likely to go to the Industrial Court instead, he said.\n\nUnlike new employees who have agreed to being vaccinated under the employment contract and can be terminated for non-compliance, Jayasingam said employers could face labour complaints by existing employees if the latter are terminated over their non-vaccinated status.\n\n\u201cIf the employer terminates them for not being vaccinated, the employee can file a complaint of dismissal without just cause and excuse,\u201d he said, explaining the process as involving employees filing complaints with the Industrial Relations Department under the Human Resources Ministry within 60 days of dismissal to see whether it could be resolved amicably, with the matter to be referred by the department director-general to the Industrial Court if it cannot be resolved.\n\nBut in situations where it is a government requirement for staff to be vaccinated in order to operate, an employer may have reason to terminate an employee who refuses to get vaccinated if it affects the business, Jayasingam said.\n\n\u201cSo the employer may have just cause and excuse to terminate the employee because he cannot carry on business,\u201d he said.\n\nJayasingam gave a hypothetical example, where an employee who works as a carer at a nursing home refuses to be vaccinated when it is a government requirement for such work, and the carer may as a result pose a risk to the elderly persons at the nursing home.\n\nIn such a situation and where there are no mitigation measures possible, the employer \u2014 who is unable to force the employee to be vaccinated \u2014 may opt to terminate the employee as it affects the business or may result in the nursing home having to be closed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s for the Industrial Court to decide whether what the employer did was reasonable or not,\u201d he said.\n\n6. Can the government make COVID-19 vaccination mandatory for employees?\n\nVan Geyzel said there may be a stronger basis for a compulsory vaccination requirement by the government for certain industries.\n\n\u201cThe laws that have been passed in response to the pandemic grant the government very broad powers to impose SOPs or pre-conditions for businesses to operate, and when it comes to roles or industries that have clear and frequent face-to-face contact and interaction with the general public, there is a stronger justification for the authorities to impose mandatory vaccination requirements. This is especially so as vaccinations are widely available and accessible.\n\n\u201cHowever, if the government overreaches and tries to impose mandatory vaccinations on other roles or industries where there is no clear face-to-face interaction or risk, I could see this being open to legal challenge,\u201d he said.\n\nJayasingam said the government could impose mandatory vaccinations on the general population including employees by passing an Act in Parliament, but believes that implementing such a policy of forcing vaccinations would only be a \u201clast resort.\u201d \u2014 Malay Mail", "keyword": ["vaccination", "employee", "employer", "say", "staff", "heres", "employers", "lawyers", "employees", "employment", "mandatory", "covid19", "vaccinated", "reasonable", "vaccinations"], "summary": "\u201cYes, if the MDTCA/KPDNHEP makes employee vaccinations mandatory or a pre-condition for approval to operate, the affected employers can impose this requirement on employees,\u201d he told Malay Mail.\n\u201cIn general, it would be very unlikely for an employee to successfully challenge an employer\u2019s mandatory vaccination policy where vaccinations have been declared a pre-condition for operations by the government.\n\u201cFirstly, I don\u2019t think the government would make vaccinations mandatory for such employees.\nCan the government make COVID-19 vaccination mandatory for employees?\n\u201cHowever, if the government overreaches and tries to impose mandatory vaccinations on other roles or industries where there is no clear face-to-face interaction or risk, I could see this being open to legal challenge,\u201d he said.", "news": "SoyaCincau.com", "date": "2021-08-02 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Ministry mulls proposal to control price of Covid-19 test kit", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbGF5bWFpbC5jb20vbmV3cy9tYWxheXNpYS8yMDIxLzA4LzAzL21pbmlzdHJ5LW11bGxzLXByb3Bvc2FsLXRvLWNvbnRyb2wtcHJpY2Utb2YtY292aWQtMTktdGVzdC1raXQvMTk5NDkwMtIBfGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbGF5bWFpbC5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wOC8wMy9taW5pc3RyeS1tdWxscy1wcm9wb3NhbC10by1jb250cm9sLXByaWNlLW9mLWNvdmlkLTE5LXRlc3Qta2l0LzE5OTQ5MDI?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://media2.malaymail.com/resize_cache/uploads/articles/2021/2021-07/covid_test_kit2_26072021-seo.jpg", "text": "Deputy Minister Datuk Rosol Wahid said based on feedback from the public, the test kit price is a burden especially to the low-income groups and families with many children. \u2014 Bernama pic\n\nFollow us on Instagram and subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates.\n\nKUALA BERANG, Aug 3 \u2015 The Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) is considering a proposal to control the price of the Covid-19 test kit, said Deputy Minister Datuk Rosol Wahid.\n\nHe said based on feedback from the public, the test kit price is a burden especially to the low-income groups and families with many children.\n\n\u201cWe were told that the price is RM39.90 each, not many can afford to buy it at that price.

Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on household income and made more people poorer, according to a study conducted by the Department of Statistics.\n\nThe Covid-19 impact study on household income in Malaysia for 2020 revealed that the number of poor households increased to 639,800 in 2020, up from 405,400 in 2019.\n\nThe findings of the study are contained in the Household Income Estimates and Incidence of Poverty Report, Malaysia, 2020 which the department released today.\n\nChief Statistician Datuk Seri Dr Mohd Uzir Mahidin said in a statement that the incidence of absolute poverty also increased, from 5.6 per cent in 2019 to 8.4 per cent in 2020, and that the incidence of hardcore poverty is estimated to increase from 0.4 per cent (2019) involving 27,200 households to 1.0 per cent involving 78,000 households.\n\nHe said the pandemic had also affected the structure of household groups, with 20 per cent of households from the M40 group with income between RM4,850 and RM10,959 having moved to the B40 group.\n\n\u201cHouseholds in the T20 group were also affected by the Covid-19 pandemic where 12.8 per cent of this group has shifted to the M40 group,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also said that as the percentage decrease in income for B40 and M40 households was larger than the T20 households group, the income distribution for B40 and M40 declined to 15.9 per cent (2019: 16.0 per cent) and 36.9 per cent (2019: 37.2 per cent), respectively.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the T20 group owned 47.2 per cent of income increased by 0.4 percentage points from 2019,\u201d he added.\n\nMohd Uzir said the mean of monthly household gross income decreased by negative 10.3 per cent to record RM7,089 as compared to RM7,901 in 2019 and added that the decline was contributed by households or individuals who experienced loss or reduction of income, particularly those with the status of employee, self-employed and others.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, this reduction of income was not only caused by job loss but also contributed by the reduction of working hours and increase in skill-related underemployment,\u201d he said.\n\nMohd Uzir said that all territories/states recorded a decline in mean and median of monthly household gross income. The Federal Territory of Putrajaya registered the lowest reduction in monthly household income and remained to record the highest mean and median of monthly household gross income as compared to other territories/states with RM12,322 and RM9,743, respectively.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, Kelantan remained to record the lowest mean and median income with RM4,411 and RM3,010, respectively,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also said that the incidence of absolute poverty by state shows that Sabah recorded the highest percentage of 25.3 per cent (2019: 19.5 per cent) while Kelantan recorded a significant increase in poverty by 8.8 percentage points to 21.2 per cent from 12.4 per cent (2019), followed by Terengganu by 5.9 percentage points to 12 per cent from 6.1 per cent (2019).\n\nMohd Uzir said the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic may be temporary as the economy is expected to improve and recover as the spread of the pandemic can be contained.\n\n\u201cFrom this analysis, it is found that the role of the federal and state governments as well as other relevant parties is pertinent in cushioning the impact of the pandemic as well as towards reviving the household income and the country\u2019s economy,\u201d he said.- Bernama", "keyword": ["study", "households", "poverty", "2019", "income", "household", "cent", "covid19", "uzir", "impact", "pandemic", "reveals", "percentage", "group", "significant"], "summary": "KUALA LUMPUR: The Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on household income and made more people poorer, according to a study conducted by the Department of Statistics.\nThe Covid-19 impact study on household income in Malaysia for 2020 revealed that the number of poor households increased to 639,800 in 2020, up from 405,400 in 2019.\nThe findings of the study are contained in the Household Income Estimates and Incidence of Poverty Report, Malaysia, 2020 which the department released today.\nMohd Uzir said that all territories/states recorded a decline in mean and median of monthly household gross income.\nThe Federal Territory of Putrajaya registered the lowest reduction in monthly household income and remained to record the highest mean and median of monthly household gross income as compared to other territories/states with RM12,322 and RM9,743, respectively.", "news": "The Sun Daily", "date": "2021-08-06 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Not so slick: Domestic Trade Ministry foils attempt to misappropriate 18,000kg of cooking oil", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEEHgxPt-i917aEqtS9q5XVIqGQgEKhAIACoHCAow-N7eCjC60NYBMLfbhwM?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Santhakumar A L"], "top-image": "https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2021/08/11/1252988.jpg", "text": "SHAH ALAM (Bernama): The Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry has foiled an attempt to misappropriate 18,000kg of cooking oil, 8,775 kg of which were subsidised 1kg packets.\n\nThe ministry's Selangor director Muhammad Zikril Azan Abdullah said raids carried out on two stores in Puchong found that the embezzlement activity was done by cutting the 1kg packets of subsidised cooking oil and transferring them to a skid tank to be bottled as 2kg and 5kg and sold for higher prices.\n\nHe said four locals and a foreigner, suspected to be an Indonesian, between the age of 30 and 50, identified as the owners of the premises were arrested to assist in the investigation.\n\nHe added that two lorries, a skid tank, forklift, cut 1kg plastic packets and bottles of cooking oil used to make the transfer were confiscated.

earnings in the second half of the financial year 2021 (2H21), underpinned by higher exports volume and refining margins.\n\nCGS-CIMB Securities Sdn Bhd analysts Nagulan Ravi and Ivy Ng Lee Fang, in a research report, stated that MSM have rightly hedged 99% of its financial year 2021 forecast (FY21F) domestic wholesale raw sugar requirement at US$0.13 (RM0.55) to US$0.14 per pounds (lbs) and 43% of its FY22F requirement at US$0.15-0.16/lbs.\n\nLast year\u2019s raw sugar price averaged at US$0.13-0.14/lbs.\n\n\u201cThis bodes well for MSM given raw sugar prices have been trending higher over the past 18 months to US$0.185/lbs currently, due to supply disruptions in Brazil and Thailand,\u201d the analysts stated in the report yesterday, following a recent update from the company\u2019s management.\n\nThe analysts stated that MSM expects a 10% year-on-year (YoY) growth in its domestic sales volumes in FY21F and has raised its average selling prices (ASPs) for both the wholesale (up to the maximum ceiling price of RM2.69 per kg) and industry segments.\n\nThe higher ASPs and sales volumes would help boost MSM\u2019s domestic refining margins in 2H21F, they added.\n\nRavi and Ng further stated that MSM had secured export contracts worth 65% to 70% of its original 300,000MT export sales target for FY21F.\n\n\u201cThe group is now optimistic of delivering close to 350,000MT of export sales in FY21F, in line with our forecast of 340,000MT, which is a 25% YoY growth versus FY20,\u201d Ravi and Ng added.\n\nThey said the higher export volumes would be driven by stronger demand from its largest export destination, Vietnam, which accounts for around 50% of its exports, and other countries that have reopened from Covid-19 restrictions.\n\nIncreased demand for its value-added products such as liquid sugar, fine syrup and premix products could increase volumes.\n\nThe analysts viewed exports growth would lower refining costs at the group\u2019s refinery in Johor.\n\n\u201cPost the optimisation of its Johor refinery, MSM expects to achieve a 50% utilisation factor (UF) for its Johor refinery in 2H21.\n\n\u201cWe project the Johor refinery could return to the black in FY22F as we project a 52% UF for the year, driven by higher exports volumes,\u201d Ravi and Ng added.\n\nCGS-CIMB forecast MSM to deliver Ebitda margins of 10.9% to 12.4% in FY21-23F, led by higher domestic and export margins and more robust export volumes.\n\n\u201cWe raise our FY21-23F earnings per share forecast by 1.5% to 6.9% to reflect lower refining costs and higher export premiums.\n\n\u201cIn light of this, we raise our target price (TP) to RM1.69 based on a price/net tangible asset (P/ NTA) of 1.2 times (one standard deviation below MSM\u2019s 10-year average P/NTA) versus one time previously,\u201d the analysts wrote.\n\nThe brokerage firm also upgraded MSM to \u2018Add\u2019 as the stock offers a 25% upside to its TP and attractive dividend yields of 6.1% to 7.5% in FY21-23F.\n\nFurther key catalysts include potential equity placements to collaborative partners and the completion of the sale of MSM Perlis, which will allow the MSM group to book a one-off

integrated nature of the Asean\u2019s supply chain, the impact from Vietnam\u2019s Covid-19 woes which culminated in the extension of lockdown measures under the government\u2019s Directive 16 in various provinces in the south are felt by Malaysian businesses that have a presence there.\n\nThe directive stipulates the closure of non-essential businesses, ban on public gatherings and severely limited transport services, in an attempt to contain the wave of Covid Delta variant infections.\n\nIn the past, Vietnam enjoyed success in containing the pandemic attributed to prompt border closure and lockdown measures, as well as an extensive testing and contact tracing strategy.\n\nVietnam recorded 8,324 new Covid-19 cases on Friday, according to the country\u2019s Ministry of Health. The new infections brought the total tally to 193,381, with 3,016 deaths, the ministry said.\n\nCurrently, 19 southern localities in the country, including Ho Chi Minh City, have implemented a lockdown via Directive 16 until Aug 16.

It is assessing the impact of the closure on its financial performance and announcements will be made if there is any material development.\n\nPoh Huat Resources Holdings Bhd\n\nThe group\u2019s subsidiary, Poh Huat Furniture Industries Vietnam Joint Stock Co, which has factories in Binh Duong Province and Dong Nai Province, has halted production activities in line with the lockdown order. As of July 21, it said none of its employees in the two locations has exhibited any Covid-19 symptoms and it will undertake screening and quarantine measures should any employee exhibit symptoms or be confirmed positive of the virus.\n\nConsequently, the production interruption is expected to cause delay in the shipment of orders to its customers in the US. Poh Huat\u2019s management is in discussions with affected customers to reschedule their delivery dates for affected orders.

These criteria must be publicised so that any future decisions will be solely based on evidence,\u201d MHC explained.\n\nAdditionally, the coalition said the government should clarify the specifics of these relaxed restrictions, because blanket vaccine privileges will create loopholes that will impede NRP.\n\n\u201cFor example, the government must answer questions like: What is the rationale to allow home quarantine for vaccinated travellers, how long is the quarantine and how will we monitor? How do we close the loopholes that may allow \u2018inter-state vacations on the pretext of visiting our children?\u2019\u201d it said.\n\nMeanwhile, Malaysian Medical Association (MMA) president Datuk Dr Subramaniam Muniandy said the decision to relax restrictions must be supported with sufficient scientific evidence.\n\n\u201cIf it is indeed a decision based on science, why then is travel allowed for those wishing to see their spouse or their young children? Either it\u2019s sufficiently safe for the fully vaccinated to travel, in which case all vaccinated individuals should be allowed to do so, or it is not, in which nobody should travel,\u201d he said.\n\nHe noted that some of those states in Phase 2 are showing an increasing trend in Covid-19 cases.\n\n\u201cThe government should stop its hyping up on the total number of cases. What is important are hospital bed utilisation and the intensive care units (ICUs) situation in the country,\u201d Dr Subramaniam said.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, we hope that the government will provide an update on the positivity rate and the status of bed utilisation and ICUs in each state as these will be more meaningful indicators apart from the daily new cases. It is important that the public be kept informed of the bed capacity and ICUs status in their respective state,\u201d he added.\n\nMMA also said that the lifting of restrictions must also take into

skin and hair.\n\nETX Daily Up is focussing on a few that should help convince you to either concoct your own treatments, or embrace some of the numerous cosmetic formulations based on this precious ingredient.\n\nCaffeine, an active ingredient that shouldn\u2019t be ignored\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon to find cosmetics formulated with caffeine, an active ingredient known for its slimming and firming benefits.\n\nGenerally, it is found in creams, gels, and other beauty products designed to help lose a few centimetres on the hips, thighs, or buttocks, as well as in anti-cellulite products or formulations designed to help users improve toning or firmness.\n\nBut caffeine is also present in certain facial care products, again with the aim of fighting skin slackening, but also \u2013 and above all \u2013 to improve the appearance of the eye contour area and reduce puffiness and dark circles (it can be even more effective if the product has spent some time in the refrigerator).\n\nCreams, gels, masks, cleansers: caffeine is nowadays found in products at all price points in the cosmetic departments of department stores and specialised shops.\n\nIn the form of powder and grounds\n\nWith the advent of DIY beauty, coffee now shows up in many so-called \u201chomemade\u201d recipes in the form of powder or grounds.\n\nRich in caffeine, these formulations can offer the advantages mentioned above, but are also powerful antioxidants, which allows them to fight against certain effects seen on mature skins, and more generally against skin aging.\n\nIn addition to these inherent virtues, coffee grounds, thanks to their specific texture, also make for a great exfoliant for sloughing off dead cells.\n\nAll you need to do is mix it with other ingredients: egg white for a mask, vegetable oil and honey for a face and body scrub, or even on its own to exfoliate scalp and hair to make it shinier.\n\nOver on TikTok, known for being the go-to social network for DIY beauty recipes, one can also discover a multitude of recipes for masks and scrubs made from soluble coffee or coffee beans.\n\nRecipes that users seem to have not only tested but also

collaborating with GE Digital on aircraft fuel efficiency monitoring solutions as part of the carrier\u2019s initiatives to meet its sustainability goals.\n\nThe national flag carrier adopted GE Digital\u2019s Fuel Insight and FlightPulse aviation software to transform and modernise the airline\u2019s fuel efficiency programme.\n\nMAB has implemented various initiatives including efficiency measures, investments in sustainability solutions and waste reduction across its operations to address its sustainability goals.\n\nThe fuel efficiency programme has been running for over a decade, contributing to a 15% fuel burn improvement recorded over the past eight years.\n\nMAB\u2019s group operations officer, Ahmad Luqman Mohd Azmi, stated promoting sustainability in all of the MAB\u2019s operations has always been a top priority.\n\nHe said digitalisation is a core component of the airlines\u2019 long term business plan and such efforts bring immediate value especially in the area of fuel efficiency.\n\n\u201cWe are looking forward to such a partnership that contributes to the airline\u2019s efforts to accelerate our sustainability target.\n\n\u201cThrough these solutions, we seek to play a greater part in building a legacy for future generations and enhancing our own airline\u2019s sustainability efforts,\u201d Ahmad Luqman said in a statement yesterday.\n\nFuel Insight is a cost and emissions monitoring solution that works by understanding data from the aircraft to uncover valuable intelligence that helps increase fuel efficiency and reduce waste.\n\nIt also gives operators actionable intelligence at multiple levels allowing analysts to drill down macro trends to understand issues on a per-flight level.\n\nThe software uses GE Digital\u2019s Event Measurement System (EMS) aviation data and analytics platform to merge flight data with flight plans, load sheets and fuel uplift data, identify the most attainable fuel savings opportunities, and track the incremental savings across the operation.\n\nFlightPulse, meanwhile, puts data directly into the hands of pilots, allowing them to visualise their savings over time.\n\nPilots who understand their own performance can adjust their flight plans to maximise safety and fuel efficiency.\n\nSecure benchmarking and data sharing allows crew members to see their contribution to projects and dramatically shortens the feedback loop.\n\nMAB evaluated the software with an extensive team of pilots, dispatchers and analysts who endorsed the software solution, which is hosted on GE Digital\u2019s EMS platform.\n\nEMS is built on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform providing compute, data, and security services.\n\nGE Digital\u2019s GM of the aviation software business Andrew Coleman said the company is committed to environmental excellence and that includes ensuring its customers are empowered to reduce the impact of their technology and environmental footprint within their operations.\n\n\u201cThese solutions will help MAB to leverage software to improve efficiency and reduce carbon emissions,\u201d Coleman added.\n\nThe solution will be implemented by the GE Digital aviation software teams in Austin, Texas and Shanghai, China.\n\nAdditionally, GE Digital provides MAB with the tools to build its big data analytics and leverage modern tools for data analysis

But fans in Malaysia have something to look forward to as two locals are working on a real-life version of the game \u2013 and this time, you can finally taste your veggies.\n\nWith the help of artificial intelligence and, in the near future, drones, Aquaville Asia hopes to become the world\u2019s first aquaponics farm where subscribers can nurture actual crops through their phones.\n\nFeeling like kale this week but kangkung the next? No problem, just tap on your screen and come harvest day, you will be greeted at your doorstep with fresh greens harvested from your own aquaponic plot.\n\nThat\u2019s the plan, at least \u2013 but for the time being, the concept is already in motion where subscribers can get five packs of vegetables delivered four times a month, with optional tilapia fish.\n\nAquaville founder Chia Weng Yan tells FMT that the idea came to him in the middle of the night. \u201cI dreamt about it and jotted down \u2018FarmVille in real life\u2019,\u201d the 40-year-old says.\n\n\u201cI created a pitch deck for it thinking it was a great idea, but didn\u2019t execute it and kept it on my computer for a long time,\u201d he adds, explaining that he struggled to find someone with the technological know-how to make his literal dream a reality.\n\nThen, in July last year, Chia found the perfect person for the job.\n\nLoke Chung Eng had posted on Facebook about robotics and projects involving IOT, or \u201cinternet of things\u201d, a network of physical objects embedded with sensors, software and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data.\n\nA phone call later and Chia had joined forces with Loke, 33, to create Aquaville Asia. The duo worked for months on the concept.\n\nWhile Loke spent time programming the AI system, Chia reached out to urban farmers, friends and family members to get them on board.\n\nThe duo forged an alliance with AHA Services Malaysia, a farm run by urban agriculturalists who provide Aquaville with all their farming requirements, including maintenance, harvest and delivery of fresh produce to subscribers.\n\nChia and Loke leave the farming to these experts and do their share by equipping the farm with Aquaville\u2019s AI technology.\n\n\u201cWe provide them with smart-farm capabilities so if any subscriptions come in, they are ready to harvest and deliver the produce,\u201d Chia explains.\n\nHe adds that using AI, Loke created a way to spot diseases in crops using an NDVI camera that scans vegetables at different wavelengths \u201cso you know if they are dying ahead of time\u201d.\n\nThe AI system can even monitor pH levels, humidity, heat and water levels. All their crops are pesticide-free.\n\nAquaville was officially launched in January this year, and subscribers have been effusive about how lush and crisp their vegetables are, compared with those bought in a store.\n\nSome customers have also funnelled their harvests to the needy, among them three companies that donated to a special-needs home in Petaling Jaya \u2013 sending bundles of fresh greens to feed 74 children between January and June \u2013 as well as contributed towards the white flag movement.\n\nIn the near future, Chia and Loke aim to introduce an application and drone system that will swoop over crops and capture real-time footage. Subscribers will be able to monitor their greens and control them through the app.\n\nAdditionally, the duo hope to empower the less fortunate and provide deaf, mute and B40 families with job opportunities on the farm.\n\nIt may take a few years for this FarmVille dream to fully become a reality, but the Aquaville innovators are hopeful and looking forward to a bright and greener future.\n\nFor fresh produce at your door each week or to help the needy, contact Aquaville Asia via Facebook or check out their website.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["taste", "malaysias", "veggies", "provide", "ai", "loke", "crops", "system", "chia", "aquaville", "farmville", "subscribers", "fresh", "vegetables"], "summary": "PETALING JAYA: Thousands were left cropless and devastated last year when Zynga\u2019s popular game FarmVille announced the end of its 11-year legacy.\nBut fans in Malaysia have something to look forward to as two locals are working on a real-life version of the game \u2013 and this time, you can finally taste your veggies.\nAquaville founder Chia Weng Yan tells FMT that the idea came to him in the middle of the night.\nWhile Loke spent time programming the AI system, Chia reached out to urban farmers, friends and family members to get them on board.\nThe AI system can even monitor pH levels, humidity, heat and water levels.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-08-12 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "1989 Proton Black Knight Wins \u201cUnexceptional\u201d Award In UK Car Festival", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL2Z1bi8yMDIxLzA4LzAzLzE5ODktcHJvdG9uLWJsYWNrLWtuaWdodC13aW5zLXVuZXhjZXB0aW9uYWwtYXdhcmQtaW4tdWstY2FyLWZlc3RpdmFsL9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL2Z1bi8yMDIxLzA4LzAzLzE5ODktcHJvdG9uLWJsYWNrLWtuaWdodC13aW5zLXVuZXhjZXB0aW9uYWwtYXdhcmQtaW4tdWstY2FyLWZlc3RpdmFsL2FtcC8?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Azizul Rahman Ismail", "Maya Suraya"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Proton-Black-Knight.jpeg", "text": "Subscribe to our new Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates.\n\nThe Proton Saga is Malaysia\u2019s first car and was the symbol of the nation\u2019s success.

The colour of its bright and deep red seeds was the inspiration for the signature hue of the national car.\n\nHowever, the reality is, the name \u201cSaga\u201d was the winning entry in a competition held in 1984.\n\nThe winner, Staf Sarjan Ismail Jaafar said that the name is actually an acronym for Safety, Achievement, Greatness, and Ability.\n\nThey Don\u2019t Make Them Like They Used To\n\nThe first generation Saga had many iterations and was in production up to 1992.\n\nOne of its most notable versions of the Saga was a hatchback released in 1987 during the peak of popularity of a certain TV show starring a certain modified Pontiac Trans Am.\n\nThe hatchback was called the Proton Knight. It was later named Proton Saga Aeroback, perhaps for copyright reasons. But to be fair, the new name is more descriptive.\n\nAt the same time, the Proton Saga was also sold all over the world including the UK.\n\nIn fact, the UK even got versions of the Proton Saga that are not available in Malaysia.

This is the most likely scenario,\u201d said Le Parisien this morning.\n\n\u201cIt only seems to be a matter of hours,\u201d suggested sports daily L\u2019Equipe, which proclaimed \u201cwe are entering the most incredible days in the history of the French championship\u201d.\n\nBefore signing the contract in Paris, Messi will first have to undergo a medical examination.\n\nStressing no deals had been done, Messi conceded at his tearful farewell news conference in Barcelona yesterday that joining PSG was a \u201cpossibility\u201d.\n\nIn reality, they are the only club who can afford what is expected to be a deal worth \u20ac35 million a year for the 34-year-old Argentine.\n\n\u201cI gave everything for Barcelona from the first day that I arrived right to the last. I never imagined having to say goodbye,\u201d a tearful Messi told the news conference.\n\n\u201cI have still not come to terms with the reality of leaving this club now \u2013 I love this club.\u201d\n\nThis morning, the images of the Argentinian in tears leapt out from the pages of all the Spanish sports dailies such as Marca, AS and Sport.\n\nOne note of discord came from a group of Barcelona fans, represented by Parisian lawyer Juan Branco, who announced today their intention to lodge a complaint with the European Commission in connection with the rules of financial fair play that Barcelona and PSG must follow.\n\nThe group also intends to ask the French courts to suspend a possible transfer.\n\nMessi, widely considered the most gifted player in the history of the game, won 35 trophies at Barcelona after joining as a 13-year-old \u2013 including four Champions Leagues and 10 league titles while his 672 goals are a record tally for one club.\n\n\u2018Great for Ligue 1\u2019\n\nDespite offering to cut his salary by half to seal a new five-year deal which a club carrying debts of \u20ac1.2 billion and the player had agreed on, the agreement foundered on strict Spanish league salary restrictions.\n\nSome in France\u2019s Ligue 1 have mixed feelings about the impending arrival of Messi who will form a superstar attacking force alongside Kylian Mbappe and Neymar, who earns a reported \u20ac36 million a year and is a former Barcelona teammate of the Argentine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary for Ligue 1,\u201d said Metz coach Frederic Antonetti.\n\n\u201cBut for a purist like me, Messi should have finished his career at Barcelona.\u201d\n\nThis summer PSG have already added veteran Spanish defender Sergio Ramos from Real Madrid, where he won four Champions League crowns, and Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma.\n\nMessi is a free agent.\n\nRamos also arrived on a free transfer.\n\nA move to the Parc des Princes would mean a reunion with his Argentina international colleague Angel di Maria.\n\nAn added attraction is that coach Mauricio Pochettino, like Messi, started his career at Newell\u2019s Old Boys in Rosario, Argentina.\n\nPochettino has been giving nothing away on the arrival of Messi.\n\n\u201cThere have been lots of rumours. Lots of things are being said,\u201d he said as PSG laboured to a 2-1 win over Troyes in their opening game of the new league season.\n\nJorge Sampaoli, the Argentine coach of PSG\u2019s bitter rivals Marseille, said the arrival of Messi can only be good news for French football.\n\n\u201cIt would be great for Ligue 1, he\u2019s the best player in the world,\u201d said Sampaoli.\n\n\u201cFrench football has won a lot and grown a lot in recent seasons.\n\n\u201cEven if he goes to a club other than Marseille, it will be good. Everyone would be riveted.

year\u2019s Merdeka will be like no other, courtesy of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nWith most of the Klang Valley and other urban centres under strict lockdown, the usual display of patriotic sentiments will be somewhat drowned out by the pervasive gloom of the moment.\n\nYet, 27 artists have chosen to express their love for the country during the month of Merdeka by displaying their works in an online exhibition titled very simply \u201cJalur Gemilang\u201d.\n\nOpen for viewing until the end of the month, the exhibition is hosted by Artas Galeri, an art gallery based in Petaling Jaya.\n\nAccording to Roy Ng, Artas Galeri\u2019s director, plans were already underway to hold a physical Merdeka-themed exhibition in the months leading up to August.\n\nHowever, with the extension of MCO 3.0, it became painfully clear that Plan B would have to be executed.\n\n\u201cDue to the pandemic and the increasing number of cases, I decided to launch an online show with an e-catalogue instead,\u201d he said.\n\nThat way, art enthusiasts will still be able to view the art pieces themselves without leaving the safety of their homes.\n\n\u201cMost of these artists\u2019 works exhibited in the \u2018Jalur Gemilang\u2019 exhibition are based on our national flag\u2019s colours,\u201d Ng said, adding that a majority of them used copious amounts of red, yellow, blue and white in multiple art styles including abstract, still-life and figurative.\n\nAccording to him, the artists are a fascinating group made up of graduates fresh out of art school as well as senior artists who have made a name for themselves in the art world.\n\nFMT had the pleasure of interviewing six of the artists regarding their hopes for the country this Merdeka month.\n\nYuki Lim Xiao Mun, artist of the almost ethereal \u201cThe Paradise Land\u201d, had this to say: \u201cMy hope for this Merdeka month is that our country can be restored to good condition after the economic hardship caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nShe said it was also her sincere hope that Malaysia\u2019s leaders will lead the country down the right path by practising integrity in their leadership.\n\nLikewise, Fadzril Fakaruddin encouraged Malaysians to stay united no matter what the circumstances, so that together, they could be free of Covid-19 for good.\n\nWhile Hamir Soib hopes for better governance, fellow artist Najib Ahmad Bamadhaj is hopeful for a return to normalcy and the good \u2018ol pre-Covid days.\n\nNational unity is something that veteran artist, Awang Damit, believes is vital if the country is to survive these difficult times.\n\nAnd another artist, Zulkefli Talha, reminded Malaysians to love each other as fellow countrymen regardless of racial or religious differences.\n\n\u201cLeaders have to be good examples for the people. And both leaders and the people have to work together to end this pandemic and return Malaysia to its former glory.\u201d\n\nNg told FMT that the pandemic had been especially tough on many artists. The numerous lockdowns this past year and a half meant potential buyers were unable to view the artworks personally and as a consequence, there was little to no sales.\n\nHe said there was an urgent need for artists to find alternative avenues to display their work so that they could continue to earn a decent living.\n\nNg explained that things have not been looking up for artists for a while now. Prior to the pandemic, the sluggish economy meant artists struggled to make a sale. The lockdowns brought about by the pandemic, only made things worse.\n\n\u201cMost collectors and buyers prefer to see the pieces in person. There\u2019s a huge difference between seeing artworks personally and virtually,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen you view an artwork physically, you will be able to see the texture, notice the colour tones and spot the little details. That\u2019s something these virtual exhibitions sadly cannot offer.\u201d\n\nHowever, this has not dampened the spirit of art collectors such as Brendan Siva in regard to the \u201cJalur Gemilang\u201d exhibition.\n\n\u201cEach piece is unique as an individual interpretation and expression of what Malaysia represents and symbolises in the eyes of the artist. It reflects the rich cultural and social fabric of Malaysia and its people.\u201d\n\nAnother art collector, Bingley Sim added, \u201cThe different styles and approaches in the use of the red, blue, yellow and white colours in the artworks reflect the exuberant spirit of Malaysia.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe works in the \u2018Jalur Gemilang\u2019 exhibition this year are all about resilience, tenacity and hope,\u201d said fellow art collector Cheow Wee.\n\n\u201cArt is a topic that brings people together no matter what ethnicity or religious belief one belongs to.\u201d\n\nHe added that since artists too are experiencing a bad year, it is important for other Malaysians to step up and support them.\n\n\u201cWe want to urge local artists never to give up as many of us will support them in our own little ways. After all, Kita Jaga Kita.\u201d\n\nTo find out more about Artas Galeri, visit them on Instagram, Facebook or WhatsApp 010-9009363 for an e-catalogue.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["exhibition", "art", "local", "pandemic", "month", "works", "merdeka", "view", "artists", "mark", "country", "online", "artist"], "summary": "PETALING JAYA: There\u2019s no question that this year\u2019s Merdeka will be like no other, courtesy of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nYet, 27 artists have chosen to express their love for the country during the month of Merdeka by displaying their works in an online exhibition titled very simply \u201cJalur Gemilang\u201d.\nOpen for viewing until the end of the month, the exhibition is hosted by Artas Galeri, an art gallery based in Petaling Jaya.\nFMT had the pleasure of interviewing six of the artists regarding their hopes for the country this Merdeka month.\n\u201cWe want to urge local artists never to give up as many of us will support them in our own little ways.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-08-13 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "US smash world record in men\u2019s 4x100m medley relay", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9zcG9ydHMvMjAyMS8wOC8wMS91cy1zbWFzaC13b3JsZC1yZWNvcmQtaW4tbWVucy00eDEwMG0tbWVkbGV5LXJlbGF5L9IBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/us-relay-4x100-010821-ap.jpg", "text": "TOKYO: A storming butterfly leg from Caeleb Dressel powered the US to a new world record and the gold medal in the men\u2019s Olympic 4x100m medley relay final today.\n\nThe US team of Ryan Murphy, Michael Andrew, Dressel and Zach Apple touched in 3:26.78s to smash the global 3:27.28s mark set at the 2009 World Championships.\n\nBritain came second in 3:27.51s and Italy were third in 3:29.17s.\n\nThe Americans were trailing at 200m after Andrew\u2019s breaststroke leg against Britain\u2019s Adam Peaty but when Dressel hit the water that all changed.\n\nHe clawed back the lead, leaving Apple to finish the job.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["mens", "water", "4x100m", "leg", "medley", "trailing", "touched", "dressel", "record", "world", "zach", "apple", "todaythe", "smash", "relay", "tokyo"], "summary": "TOKYO: A storming butterfly leg from Caeleb Dressel powered the US to a new world record and the gold medal in the men\u2019s Olympic 4x100m medley relay final today.\nThe US team of Ryan Murphy, Michael Andrew, Dressel and Zach Apple touched in 3:26.78s to smash the global 3:27.28s mark set at the 2009 World Championships.\nBritain came second in 3:27.51s and Italy were third in 3:29.17s.\nThe Americans were trailing at 200m after Andrew\u2019s breaststroke leg against Britain\u2019s Adam Peaty but when Dressel hit the water that all changed.\nHe clawed back the lead, leaving Apple to finish the job.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-08-01 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Meet Ita O\u2019Brian: in-demand intimacy coordinator", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9sZWlzdXJlL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvMjAyMS8wNy8zMC9tZWV0LWl0YS1vYnJpYW4taW4tZGVtYW5kLWludGltYWN5LWNvb3JkaW5hdG9yL9IBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ita-lifestyle.jpg", "text": "LONDON: Britain\u2019s Ita O\u2019Brien is one of entertainment\u2019s unsung stars, ensuring actors are comfortable filming their most sensitive scenes in a job she has made her own.\n\nThe 56-year-old intimacy coordinator has been a key figure behind sex scenes in acclaimed television series such as \u201cI May Destroy You\u201d, \u201cSex Education\u201d and \u201cNormal People\u201d.\n\nPreserving the intimacy of an artist filming a rape depiction, setting up a sex scene with a virgin actor, and identifying the limits each actor is comfortable with are all issues O\u2019Brien is regularly confronted with.\n\nA typical conversation she regularly has with stars, she says, goes along the lines of: \u201cHe is going to put his hand here, you put yours there and then you start the fellatio.\u201d\n\nShe sees her role as one of ensuring \u201copen communication\u201d between the director and the actors on all intimate scenes that may include kissing, nudity or sex.\n\n\u201cThis is a process by which we bring our professional structure to intimacy\u201d, allowing the on-screen stars to \u201cbring all of the skills of the actor to this moment,\u201d she adds.\n\n\u201cWe agree on a consent of touch and then a clear process by which we choreograph the intimate contact clearly. So it\u2019s just like dance.\u201d\n\nEach scene will be discussed and rehearsed beforehand, away from the glare of the dozens of people usually present on a set.\n\n\u201cWhen the camera rolls or they\u2019re up on stage, they know they can perform that intimate contact, knowing where they\u2019re going to be touched,\u201d she says.\n\nAt the heart of her philosophy is consent, in an industry which has been rocked in recent years by sexual assault claims. Her motto, which she says she often repeats to actors, is: \u201cYour \u2018no\u2019 is a gift. Tell us your \u2018no\u2019, so that we can trust your \u2018yes'\u201d.\n\n\u2018Incredibly hard\u2019\n\nO\u2019Brien was a dancer in the theatre for 10 years and then an actress for eight before she sensed an opportunity and became an intimacy coordinator in 2014.\n\nIt was a pioneering move at a time when actors\u2019 consent was little talked about, and before the #MeToo movement against sexual abuse and sexual harassment.\n\nBefore then, \u201cif an actor ever said \u2018no\u2019, they\u2019d be a troublemaker or a diva, and they would certainly be worried about losing their job,\u201d she recalls.\n\nIn such an environment, she describes her early days in the role as \u201cincredibly hard\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had productions where I\u2019ve been told not to speak to the director,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m serving the director\u2019s vision, but the director doesn\u2019t want to speak to me because he\u2019s a 74-year-old man, who basically doesn\u2019t want to acknowledge my existence.\u201d\n\nOn other occasions, she was not allowed on the set because the actors or director did not want her help.\n\nAttitudes have since changed a lot. The profession is becoming more popular and O\u2019Brien is in high demand, especially after Michaela Coel dedicated her best actress BAFTA win this year for \u201cI May Destroy You\u201d to her.\n\n\u201cThank you, Ita, for making a space safe, for creating physical, emotional and professional boundaries, so we can make work about exploitation, loss of respect, about abuse of powers,

Covid jabs per day and are moving towards increasing to 20,000 doses per day. \u2014 Picture by Sayuti Zainudin\n\nFollow us on Instagram and subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates.\n\nGEORGE TOWN, Aug 1 \u2014 Factories and small businesses in Penang, especially those hard hit by disruptions due to the Covid-19 pandemic, are looking forward to resuming operations as soon as possible even if it means making vaccination mandatory for their workers.\n\nAs there are currently no laws to enforce mandatory Covid-19 vaccination on workers, some companies are taking steps to get their workers to register for vaccination.\n\nPenang Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM) chairman Datuk Jimmy Ong said most factories here are encouraging their workers to register for their Covid jabs through various methods.\n\n\u201cSome companies are giving paid leave to their workers to go for vaccination and some are even offering monetary rewards,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the main reason multinational companies (MNC) are setting up Program Imunisasi Industri Covid-19 Kerjasama Awam-Swasta (Pikas) vaccination centres within their own factory grounds is to encourage their workers to get vaccinated.\n\nHe said the Pikas PPVs in Penang are now dispensing 15,000 doses per day and are moving towards increasing to 20,000 doses per day.\n\nHe said the vaccination of workers in MNCs is progressing very fast due to the on-site PPVs for larger factories which employ thousands of workers.\n\n\u201cIt is slower for small medium enterprises as they can only send their workers to the Pikas PPVs and there are only two of those now; one in Jawi and one at Equatorial Hotel,\u201d he said.\n\nEven with vaccination in full force, Ong said some of the companies in the manufacturing sector have continued to conduct screening of workers every two to three weeks.\n\n\u201cScreening still has to continue to control any potential spread of cases within the factories because we know, even those vaccinated still have a risk of contracting Covid-19,\u201d he said.\n\nFMM Penang branch offers a Penang SAFE programme for factories to conduct screening tests for its workers at a lower rate of RM60 per person.\n\nOng said the programme recommends that any company taking up the package conduct screening of 100 per cent of its staff in the first round.\n\n\u201cAfter that, they can conduct screening on 20 per cent of their staff for the second round and another 20 per cent on the third round, and so on,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, one of the SMEs in Penang, Chemdyes Sdn Bhd, has checked labour laws on ways to compel its employees to get vaccinated.\n\nThe company\u2019s managing director Joe Sidek said it was informed that there are at present no laws for the company to compel its employees to register for vaccination.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t legally force them to register for vaccination, it is a personal right, so what we do is to encourage them to do it as a way to safeguard everyone\u2019s safety in the workplace,\u201d he said.\n\nThe factory, specialising in textile chemicals, has about 22 workers and Joe said all have registered for vaccination.\n\nA nurse administers a dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at the Pikas vaccination centre at the Bukit Jawi Golf Resort in Penang June 17, 2021. \u2014 Picture by Sayuti Zainudin\n\nHe said despite the downturn in the textile industry due to the pandemic, Chemdyes recorded stable revenue last year and expects an increase in revenue this year.\n\n\u201cWe have kept all our staff and did not cut any pay so we have been very fortunate and we want to ensure that everyone is safe, we do not want to have any cases that could disrupt production,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said he would allow his workers to stay home for a week and to undergo screening tests if they have been exposed to places with a high number of Covid-19 cases.\n\nMeanwhile, it was reported that the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) is considering making vaccination of all employees in the retail sector one of the pre-conditions for approval for companies to resume operation, during the National Recovery Plan (NRP) period.\n\nYin\u2019s Sourdough Bakery and cafe co-founder Ong Seng Keat has already made it compulsory for all of its 40 workers to sign up for vaccination.\n\n\u201cWe will check our workers\u2019 MySejahtera to make sure they have registered and if we have to pay for it, we will,\u201d he said.\n\nHis company has already paid for all of his workers in Klang Valley to be vaccinated under a retail industry vaccination programme.\n\nHe hopes such programmes will be available in Penang so he can send all his workers to be vaccinated as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cThe government really needs to speed up its vaccination programme for the economic frontliners because we deal with people every day,\u201d he said.\n\nMugshot Cafe co-founder Jesse Tan agrees with Ong that vaccination for economic frontliners should be sped up.\n\n\u201cSo far, all of our staff have registered for vaccination but they are still waiting for their appointments,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of Mugshot\u2019s staff contracted Covid-19 a few months back due to close contact with a relative but fortunately, it did not spread to the other staff in the cafe.\n\n\u201cThere are 15 of us in the cafe and all of us went for screening the moment we found out he was positive but luckily, we were all negative,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the incident further emphasises the importance of vaccination for all workers who deal with customers daily.\n\nAs for Hin Bus Depot manager Tan Shih Thoe, he is also considering only allowing fully vaccinated vendors to participate in the Hin Bus Depot weekly bazaar, when they are finally allowed to reopen.\n\n\u201cI was just thinking about this, especially for the market, whether I should only allow vendors who are fully vaccinated to participate... main consideration is their safety since the market is considered a crowded space,\u201d he said.\n\nThere used to be 70 vendors at the weekly market before the pandemic but due to standard operating procedures (SOPs), the number of vendors came down to around 55 each week.\n\nThe market has been closed for more than two months due to the movement control order (MCO) and subsequent phases of the NRP.\n\nHin Bus Depot has around 15 tenants, consisting of eateries and artisans, and Tan said he will also strongly encourage the tenants and their workers to register for vaccination.\n\n\u201cMost of them are in favour of vaccination as they see it as the only solution to things getting back to normal,\u201d he said.\n\nFurry Kids pet shop owner Dalbinder Singh also agrees that it is important for those in the retail sector to be vaccinated.\n\n\u201cWe are meeting people and customers daily so it is important for the safety of everyone,\u201d he

Here\u2019s what you need to know:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Can employers make vaccination compulsory for employees?\n\nEmployment lawyer Donovan Cheah said there is no law now that disallows mandatory vaccination policies by employers, and that there are no known court cases in the country about whether such a policy would be legal.\n\n\u201cGiven the severity of the pandemic, having a mandatory vaccination policy is one of the ways for employers to safeguard the safety and health of their employees and curb the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cHowever, there are no reported court cases in Malaysia about the legality of mandatory vaccination policies, and whether an employer can take disciplinary action against an employee for refusing to vaccinate,\u201d he said, but noted there have been reported cases in countries like Australia and the US which upheld the dismissal of employees who refuse to comply with their employer\u2019s mandatory vaccination policy.\n\nSpecialist employment lawyer Marcus van Geyzel said employers would generally be able to make it compulsory for their employees to undergo COVID-19 vaccination if this is due to a government-imposed requirement.\n\n\u201cYes, if the MDTCA/KPDNHEP makes employee vaccinations mandatory or a pre-condition for approval to operate, the affected employers can impose this requirement on employees,\u201d he told Malay Mail.\n\n\u201cHowever, employers should be cautious where there are special circumstances, such as where an employee is unable to receive a vaccination due to a medical condition,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIn general, it would be very unlikely for an employee to successfully challenge an employer\u2019s mandatory vaccination policy where vaccinations have been declared a pre-condition for operations by the government.\n\nIn order to bring a successful legal action, an employee would have to show that in mandating vaccination, the employer has exercised its managerial power in a non-genuine manner, or that there was victimisation or an unfair labour practice,\u201d he said.\n\n2. What if the employees say no to vaccination?\n\nCheah said employers can choose to take disciplinary action against employees who refuse vaccination, and that whether such action is reasonable depends on the situation.\n\n\u201cWhile an employer cannot physically compel an employee to take the vaccine, an employee\u2019s freedom of choice is not the same thing as freedom from consequences. There are no legal prohibitions against an employer implementing a mandatory vaccination policy, although how employers deal with breaches of this policy may be evaluated by the courts,\u201d he said.\n\nCheah said disciplinary action including dismissal may be seen as reasonable, taking into account various factors.\n\nHe listed examples such as the employee\u2019s reason for refusal; whether the employee\u2019s refusal amounts to a breach of their duties or has caused loss or damage to the company or other employees; whether the employee\u2019s job function requires him/her to have regular and frequent physical interaction with third parties.\n\nOther factors listed by Cheah are the current severity of the pandemic; whether the employer\u2019s business deals with high-risk individuals; and whether vaccination is a pre-condition from the authorities for the employer to operate.\n\n\u201cWhere an employee has a legitimate reason to refuse vaccination (eg: health condition), employers should explore other ways to address the risk, such as requiring them to carry out their duties remotely and not allowing them to enter the premises without notice,\u201d Cheah added.\n\nVan Geyzel said employers would have several options, when vaccinations are a precondition for operations but there are employees who refuse to get vaccinated.\n\nThese options are to engage with the employees, or to transfer employees to alternative roles, or to ultimately stop employing the employee.\n\n\u201cThe first step should always be for employers to have clear and open conversations with these employees to ensure that they understand the reason for the vaccination requirement.\n\n\u201cEmployers can also consider redesignating or redeploying the affected employees to other roles within the business which are not customer-facing and which may be exempted from the regulatory requirements,\u201d he said.\n\nIf redesignation and redeployment is not an option, employers would be legally able to terminate the employee\u2019s employment if it is reasonable in the circumstances, he said.\n\nVan Geyzel said there is a general legal expectation that an employee has to follow all lawful and reasonable instructions by the employer.\n\nHe added that it can be argued that an employee is carrying out an act of insubordination by refusing to be vaccinated under the circumstances, as the employee is wilfully disobeying a lawful and reasonable order issued by the employer.\n\n\u201cAny punishment or action by the employer in response to insubordination has to be reasonable or proportionate, and it can be said here that where the result of the employee\u2019s vaccination is that the business would not be allowed to operate, there are serious repercussions and therefore termination of employment is a reasonable response by the employer.\n\n\u201cAnother potential justification for termination of employment is that an unvaccinated employee would be unable to perform the job or service for which the employee was employed. This would be the case if an unvaccinated employee is not permitted by law to work.\n\n\u201cIn such a situation, it may be reasonable for an employer to deem that the employment contract cannot be performed and therefore can be terminated,\u201d he said.\n\n3. What if an employee says no to vaccination due to health conditions?\n\nAs for employees who are unable to receive COVID-19 vaccinations due to a medical condition, van Geyzel said employers could explore measures such as redesignation.\n\n\u201cFirstly, I don\u2019t think the government would make vaccinations mandatory for such employees.\n\n\u201cSecondly, even if the government issued a blanket requirement, the employer should see if it\u2019s possible to apply for an exemption for that employee, or again see if redeployment or redesignation is an option.\n\n\u201cTermination should always be a last resort, but if the employer has acted reasonably, then termination should be possible under the law,\u201d he said, also saying that an employee would be unlikely to succeed in an unfair dismissal claim if an employer treated the employee fairly and could show that the termination was reasonable in the circumstances.\n\nFor employees with pre-existing health conditions that prevent them from being vaccinated, employment lawyer Jayasingam Poopalasingam said employers can seek to take mitigation measures such as changing their work roles or have them work remotely.\n\nHowever, if the nature of the business and nature of the employee\u2019s work requires vaccination, but vaccination is not possible due to the health condition and mitigating measures are not feasible through no fault of both the employer or the employee, the employer may be left with no choice but to terminate employment.\n\nThe employee could under such circumstances file a complaint to claim that the dismissal was without just cause and excuse, but it would ultimately be for the Industrial Court to decide if the dismissal was with just cause and excuse, he said.\n\n4. Putting it into the employment contract and putting it in writing\n\nJayasingam, who is also co-chair of the Bar Council\u2019s Industrial and Employment Law Committee, similarly said there are currently no laws that mandate COVID-19 vaccination for employees.\n\nThis means that for existing employees, an employer cannot \u201cforce\u201d them to be vaccinated, but can only seek to persuade and convince the employee of the need to be vaccinated due to reasons such as the nature of the work.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing much you can do, you cannot force the employee to go for vaccination, you cannot force an employee to undergo a medical procedure, it has to be by way of consent,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf they are existing employees, it must be by way of consent. They have a right to refuse vaccination, that\u2019s why we advise employers to obtain the written consent of employees to be vaccinated,\u201d he said, explaining that a mere verbal consent is not advisable as an employee could later claim to have never given consent.\n\nFor employees who pose a high risk due to the nature of their job as a frontliner or being in contact with others but refuse vaccination, employers can transfer them to another position where they do not deal with customers or other employees, he said.\n\nBut for new employees, an employer can make being vaccinated against COVID-19 a part of the employment contract prior to them joining the company, he said.\n\n\u201cYou cannot force it but what you can do is if you are having new employees, you can put it as a term of the contract, where they must be vaccinated before they are hired for employment, or they must undertake they will be vaccinated after they join you,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the new recruit would have the option of not joining the company upon viewing the contract, while employers can terminate employment if the new hire subsequently does not comply with instructions to be vaccinated as promised under the contract.\n\n5. About legal action\n\nIf an employer forces an employee to undergo COVID-19 vaccination, the employee can possibly walk out of the job and try to claim \u201cconstructive dismissal\u201d, Jayasingam said.\n\nIn cases of constructive dismissal claims, the employer does not have to issue a letter of termination, but the employee is essentially claiming that the employer has done something in breach of his contractual rights and that the employer\u2019s conduct had resulted in the employee\u2019s resignation.\n\nSuch an employee could then seek to prove their case in the Industrial Court to claim for monetary compensation and reinstatement to the job with all previous benefits and rights unaffected, including the right to not be forced to be vaccinated, Jayasingam said. It would ultimately be for the Industrial Court to decide if there was constructive dismissal.\n\nAlternatively, employees can also file a claim in civil courts but this is usually not preferred as the compensation is very small, with most employees likely to go to the Industrial Court instead, he said.\n\nUnlike new employees who have agreed to being vaccinated under the employment contract and can be terminated for non-compliance, Jayasingam said employers could face labour complaints by existing employees if the latter are terminated over their non-vaccinated status.\n\n\u201cIf the employer terminates them for not being vaccinated, the employee can file a complaint of dismissal without just cause and excuse,\u201d he said, explaining the process as involving employees filing complaints with the Industrial Relations Department under the Human Resources Ministry within 60 days of dismissal to see whether it could be resolved amicably, with the matter to be referred by the department director-general to the Industrial Court if it cannot be resolved.\n\nBut in situations where it is a government requirement for staff to be vaccinated in order to operate, an employer may have reason to terminate an employee who refuses to get vaccinated if it affects the business, Jayasingam said.\n\n\u201cSo the employer may have just cause and excuse to terminate the employee because he cannot carry on business,\u201d he said.\n\nJayasingam gave a hypothetical example, where an employee who works as a carer at a nursing home refuses to be vaccinated when it is a government requirement for such work, and the carer may as a result pose a risk to the elderly persons at the nursing home.\n\nIn such a situation and where there are no mitigation measures possible, the employer \u2014 who is unable to force the employee to be vaccinated \u2014 may opt to terminate the employee as it affects the business or may result in the nursing home having to be closed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s for the Industrial Court to decide whether what the employer did was reasonable or not,\u201d he said.\n\n6. Can the government make COVID-19 vaccination mandatory for employees?\n\nVan Geyzel said there may be a stronger basis for a compulsory vaccination requirement by the government for certain industries.\n\n\u201cThe laws that have been passed in response to the pandemic grant the government very broad powers to impose SOPs or pre-conditions for businesses to operate, and when it comes to roles or industries that have clear and frequent face-to-face contact and interaction with the general public, there is a stronger justification for the authorities to impose mandatory vaccination requirements. This is especially so as vaccinations are widely available and accessible.\n\n\u201cHowever, if the government overreaches and tries to impose mandatory vaccinations on other roles or industries where there is no clear face-to-face interaction or risk, I could see this being open to legal challenge,\u201d he said.\n\nJayasingam said the government could impose mandatory vaccinations on the general population including employees by passing an Act in Parliament, but believes that implementing such a policy of forcing vaccinations would only be a \u201clast resort.\u201d \u2014 Malay Mail", "keyword": ["vaccination", "employee", "employer", "say", "staff", "heres", "employers", "lawyers", "employees", "employment", "mandatory", "covid19", "vaccinated", "reasonable", "vaccinations"], "summary": "\u201cYes, if the MDTCA/KPDNHEP makes employee vaccinations mandatory or a pre-condition for approval to operate, the affected employers can impose this requirement on employees,\u201d he told Malay Mail.\n\u201cIn general, it would be very unlikely for an employee to successfully challenge an employer\u2019s mandatory vaccination policy where vaccinations have been declared a pre-condition for operations by the government.\n\u201cFirstly, I don\u2019t think the government would make vaccinations mandatory for such employees.\nCan the government make COVID-19 vaccination mandatory for employees?\n\u201cHowever, if the government overreaches and tries to impose mandatory vaccinations on other roles or industries where there is no clear face-to-face interaction or risk, I could see this being open to legal challenge,\u201d he said.", "news": "SoyaCincau.com", "date": "2021-08-02 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Ministry mulls proposal to control price of Covid-19 test kit", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbGF5bWFpbC5jb20vbmV3cy9tYWxheXNpYS8yMDIxLzA4LzAzL21pbmlzdHJ5LW11bGxzLXByb3Bvc2FsLXRvLWNvbnRyb2wtcHJpY2Utb2YtY292aWQtMTktdGVzdC1raXQvMTk5NDkwMtIBfGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbGF5bWFpbC5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wOC8wMy9taW5pc3RyeS1tdWxscy1wcm9wb3NhbC10by1jb250cm9sLXByaWNlLW9mLWNvdmlkLTE5LXRlc3Qta2l0LzE5OTQ5MDI?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://media2.malaymail.com/resize_cache/uploads/articles/2021/2021-07/covid_test_kit2_26072021-seo.jpg", "text": "Deputy Minister Datuk Rosol Wahid said based on feedback from the public, the test kit price is a burden especially to the low-income groups and families with many children. \u2014 Bernama pic\n\nFollow us on Instagram and subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates.\n\nKUALA BERANG, Aug 3 \u2015 The Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) is considering a proposal to control the price of the Covid-19 test kit, said Deputy Minister Datuk Rosol Wahid.\n\nHe said based on feedback from the public, the test kit price is a burden especially to the low-income groups and families with many children.\n\n\u201cWe were told that the price is RM39.90 each, not many can afford to buy it at that price.

Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on household income and made more people poorer, according to a study conducted by the Department of Statistics.\n\nThe Covid-19 impact study on household income in Malaysia for 2020 revealed that the number of poor households increased to 639,800 in 2020, up from 405,400 in 2019.\n\nThe findings of the study are contained in the Household Income Estimates and Incidence of Poverty Report, Malaysia, 2020 which the department released today.\n\nChief Statistician Datuk Seri Dr Mohd Uzir Mahidin said in a statement that the incidence of absolute poverty also increased, from 5.6 per cent in 2019 to 8.4 per cent in 2020, and that the incidence of hardcore poverty is estimated to increase from 0.4 per cent (2019) involving 27,200 households to 1.0 per cent involving 78,000 households.\n\nHe said the pandemic had also affected the structure of household groups, with 20 per cent of households from the M40 group with income between RM4,850 and RM10,959 having moved to the B40 group.\n\n\u201cHouseholds in the T20 group were also affected by the Covid-19 pandemic where 12.8 per cent of this group has shifted to the M40 group,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also said that as the percentage decrease in income for B40 and M40 households was larger than the T20 households group, the income distribution for B40 and M40 declined to 15.9 per cent (2019: 16.0 per cent) and 36.9 per cent (2019: 37.2 per cent), respectively.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the T20 group owned 47.2 per cent of income increased by 0.4 percentage points from 2019,\u201d he added.\n\nMohd Uzir said the mean of monthly household gross income decreased by negative 10.3 per cent to record RM7,089 as compared to RM7,901 in 2019 and added that the decline was contributed by households or individuals who experienced loss or reduction of income, particularly those with the status of employee, self-employed and others.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, this reduction of income was not only caused by job loss but also contributed by the reduction of working hours and increase in skill-related underemployment,\u201d he said.\n\nMohd Uzir said that all territories/states recorded a decline in mean and median of monthly household gross income. The Federal Territory of Putrajaya registered the lowest reduction in monthly household income and remained to record the highest mean and median of monthly household gross income as compared to other territories/states with RM12,322 and RM9,743, respectively.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, Kelantan remained to record the lowest mean and median income with RM4,411 and RM3,010, respectively,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also said that the incidence of absolute poverty by state shows that Sabah recorded the highest percentage of 25.3 per cent (2019: 19.5 per cent) while Kelantan recorded a significant increase in poverty by 8.8 percentage points to 21.2 per cent from 12.4 per cent (2019), followed by Terengganu by 5.9 percentage points to 12 per cent from 6.1 per cent (2019).\n\nMohd Uzir said the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic may be temporary as the economy is expected to improve and recover as the spread of the pandemic can be contained.\n\n\u201cFrom this analysis, it is found that the role of the federal and state governments as well as other relevant parties is pertinent in cushioning the impact of the pandemic as well as towards reviving the household income and the country\u2019s economy,\u201d he said.- Bernama", "keyword": ["study", "households", "poverty", "2019", "income", "household", "cent", "covid19", "uzir", "impact", "pandemic", "reveals", "percentage", "group", "significant"], "summary": "KUALA LUMPUR: The Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on household income and made more people poorer, according to a study conducted by the Department of Statistics.\nThe Covid-19 impact study on household income in Malaysia for 2020 revealed that the number of poor households increased to 639,800 in 2020, up from 405,400 in 2019.\nThe findings of the study are contained in the Household Income Estimates and Incidence of Poverty Report, Malaysia, 2020 which the department released today.\nMohd Uzir said that all territories/states recorded a decline in mean and median of monthly household gross income.\nThe Federal Territory of Putrajaya registered the lowest reduction in monthly household income and remained to record the highest mean and median of monthly household gross income as compared to other territories/states with RM12,322 and RM9,743, respectively.", "news": "The Sun Daily", "date": "2021-08-06 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Not so slick: Domestic Trade Ministry foils attempt to misappropriate 18,000kg of cooking oil", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEEHgxPt-i917aEqtS9q5XVIqGQgEKhAIACoHCAow-N7eCjC60NYBMLfbhwM?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Santhakumar A L"], "top-image": "https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2021/08/11/1252988.jpg", "text": "SHAH ALAM (Bernama): The Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry has foiled an attempt to misappropriate 18,000kg of cooking oil, 8,775 kg of which were subsidised 1kg packets.\n\nThe ministry's Selangor director Muhammad Zikril Azan Abdullah said raids carried out on two stores in Puchong found that the embezzlement activity was done by cutting the 1kg packets of subsidised cooking oil and transferring them to a skid tank to be bottled as 2kg and 5kg and sold for higher prices.\n\nHe said four locals and a foreigner, suspected to be an Indonesian, between the age of 30 and 50, identified as the owners of the premises were arrested to assist in the investigation.\n\nHe added that two lorries, a skid tank, forklift, cut 1kg plastic packets and bottles of cooking oil used to make the transfer were confiscated.

earnings in the second half of the financial year 2021 (2H21), underpinned by higher exports volume and refining margins.\n\nCGS-CIMB Securities Sdn Bhd analysts Nagulan Ravi and Ivy Ng Lee Fang, in a research report, stated that MSM have rightly hedged 99% of its financial year 2021 forecast (FY21F) domestic wholesale raw sugar requirement at US$0.13 (RM0.55) to US$0.14 per pounds (lbs) and 43% of its FY22F requirement at US$0.15-0.16/lbs.\n\nLast year\u2019s raw sugar price averaged at US$0.13-0.14/lbs.\n\n\u201cThis bodes well for MSM given raw sugar prices have been trending higher over the past 18 months to US$0.185/lbs currently, due to supply disruptions in Brazil and Thailand,\u201d the analysts stated in the report yesterday, following a recent update from the company\u2019s management.\n\nThe analysts stated that MSM expects a 10% year-on-year (YoY) growth in its domestic sales volumes in FY21F and has raised its average selling prices (ASPs) for both the wholesale (up to the maximum ceiling price of RM2.69 per kg) and industry segments.\n\nThe higher ASPs and sales volumes would help boost MSM\u2019s domestic refining margins in 2H21F, they added.\n\nRavi and Ng further stated that MSM had secured export contracts worth 65% to 70% of its original 300,000MT export sales target for FY21F.\n\n\u201cThe group is now optimistic of delivering close to 350,000MT of export sales in FY21F, in line with our forecast of 340,000MT, which is a 25% YoY growth versus FY20,\u201d Ravi and Ng added.\n\nThey said the higher export volumes would be driven by stronger demand from its largest export destination, Vietnam, which accounts for around 50% of its exports, and other countries that have reopened from Covid-19 restrictions.\n\nIncreased demand for its value-added products such as liquid sugar, fine syrup and premix products could increase volumes.\n\nThe analysts viewed exports growth would lower refining costs at the group\u2019s refinery in Johor.\n\n\u201cPost the optimisation of its Johor refinery, MSM expects to achieve a 50% utilisation factor (UF) for its Johor refinery in 2H21.\n\n\u201cWe project the Johor refinery could return to the black in FY22F as we project a 52% UF for the year, driven by higher exports volumes,\u201d Ravi and Ng added.\n\nCGS-CIMB forecast MSM to deliver Ebitda margins of 10.9% to 12.4% in FY21-23F, led by higher domestic and export margins and more robust export volumes.\n\n\u201cWe raise our FY21-23F earnings per share forecast by 1.5% to 6.9% to reflect lower refining costs and higher export premiums.\n\n\u201cIn light of this, we raise our target price (TP) to RM1.69 based on a price/net tangible asset (P/ NTA) of 1.2 times (one standard deviation below MSM\u2019s 10-year average P/NTA) versus one time previously,\u201d the analysts wrote.\n\nThe brokerage firm also upgraded MSM to \u2018Add\u2019 as the stock offers a 25% upside to its TP and attractive dividend yields of 6.1% to 7.5% in FY21-23F.\n\nFurther key catalysts include potential equity placements to collaborative partners and the completion of the sale of MSM Perlis, which will allow the MSM group to book a one-off gain from the disposal of the land of RM91.6 million at 13 sen per share.\n\nThe analysts attributed key risks to lower export margins and rising raw sugar prices.\n\nMSM is currently working on doubling its liquid sugar facility\u2019s capacity and enhancing its fine syrup facility due to the rising demand for these products.\n\nIn the longer term, the \u201cGula Prai\u201d producer plans to expand its export segment further by increasing its regional presence in the Asia-Pacific region and establishing a local presence in countries such as China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Singapore, Indonesia and South Korea.\n\nAs of 2019, MSM corroborated up to 60% of the domestic market share and ranked the eighth largest sugar refiner globally by capacity.\n\nMSM share price declined 2.22% to RM1.32 yesterday, valuing the company RM927.93 million.", "keyword": ["export", "earnings", "sugar", "poised", "2h", "higher", "domestic", "volumes", "refining", "msm", "stated", "sales", "stronger",

integrated nature of the Asean\u2019s supply chain, the impact from Vietnam\u2019s Covid-19 woes which culminated in the extension of lockdown measures under the government\u2019s Directive 16 in various provinces in the south are felt by Malaysian businesses that have a presence there.\n\nThe directive stipulates the closure of non-essential businesses, ban on public gatherings and severely limited transport services, in an attempt to contain the wave of Covid Delta variant infections.\n\nIn the past, Vietnam enjoyed success in containing the pandemic attributed to prompt border closure and lockdown measures, as well as an extensive testing and contact tracing strategy.\n\nVietnam recorded 8,324 new Covid-19 cases on Friday, according to the country\u2019s Ministry of Health. The new infections brought the total tally to 193,381, with 3,016 deaths, the ministry said.\n\nCurrently, 19 southern localities in the country, including Ho Chi Minh City, have implemented a lockdown via Directive 16 until Aug 16. Meanwhile, The lockdown in Hanoi, Vietnam\u2019s capital, has been extended by 15 days until Aug 22.\n\nAs a result, a number of Bursa Malaysia-listed issuers with facilities in Vietnam have reported suspension of operations there.\n\nYBS International Bhd\n\nIts subsidiary, Oriental Fastech Manufacturing (Vietnam), which is involved in high precision metal fabrication and assembly, is partially suspending its operations to comply with the government\u2019s directive.\n\nMagni-Tech Industries Bhd\n\nIts garment production facilities in Vietnam have been suspended in line with the government\u2019s directive. The group is mitigating the impact of the closure via close engagement with its customers to manage the production capacity challenges as well as rescheduling delivery dates to meet customer\u2019s demand. It is assessing the impact of the closure on its financial performance and announcements will be made if there is any material development.\n\nPoh Huat Resources Holdings Bhd\n\nThe group\u2019s subsidiary, Poh Huat Furniture Industries Vietnam Joint Stock Co, which has factories in Binh Duong Province and Dong Nai Province, has halted production activities in line with the lockdown order. As of July 21, it said none of its employees in the two locations has exhibited any Covid-19 symptoms and it will undertake screening and quarantine measures should any employee exhibit symptoms or be confirmed positive of the virus.\n\nConsequently, the production interruption is expected to cause delay in the shipment of orders to its customers in the US. Poh Huat\u2019s management is in discussions with affected customers to reschedule their delivery dates for affected orders. It said it is able to mitigate some of the impact from the closure as it has a certain amount of ready inventory to meet the orders and it will increase production with extended shifts upon resumption of production activities, if necessary.\n\nLatitude Tree Holdings Bhd\n\nTwo of the group\u2019s subsidiaries, Latitude Tree Vietnam Joint Stock Co and RK Resources Co Ltd, are partially suspending operations to comply with Vietnam\u2019s Directive 16.

This approach will allow it to operate at a reduced production capacity.\n\nLatitude Tree estimates the production loss from the \u20183 on the spot\u2019 approach to be around 1.2% to 1.8% of its total forecast annual output volume for FY2022.\n\n", "keyword": ["fallout", "grapple", "lockdown", "directive", "tree", "firms", "16", "vietnams", "production", "vietnam", "bursalisted", "closure", "customers", "covid", "impact", "presence", "malaysian"], "summary": "In the past, Vietnam enjoyed success in containing the pandemic attributed to prompt border closure and lockdown measures, as well as an extensive testing and contact tracing strategy.\nCurrently, 19 southern localities in the country, including Ho Chi Minh City, have implemented a lockdown via Directive 16 until Aug 16.\nAs a result, a number of Bursa Malaysia-listed issuers with facilities in Vietnam have reported suspension of operations there.\nMagni-Tech Industries BhdIts garment production facilities in Vietnam have been suspended in line with the government\u2019s directive.\nLatitude Tree Holdings BhdTwo of the group\u2019s subsidiaries, Latitude Tree Vietnam Joint Stock Co and RK Resources Co Ltd, are partially suspending operations to comply with Vietnam\u2019s Directive 16.", "news": "The Sun Daily", "date": "2021-08-08 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Introduce code of ethics for elected reps \u2013 Rais", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWJvcm5lb3Bvc3QuY29tLzIwMjEvMDgvMDcvaW50cm9kdWNlLWNvZGUtb2YtZXRoaWNzLWZvci1lbGVjdGVkLXJlcHMtcmFpcy_SAQA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2021/07/FW1176796_KL19_19072021_DEWAN-lpr.jpg", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR (Aug 7): Dewan Negara president Tan Sri Dr Rais Yatim has suggested that a code of ethics for elected representatives be introduced to members of Parliament and assemblymen to make them respected and exemplary leaders.\n\nIn his writing in the Journal of the Malaysian Parliament entitled \u2018Etika Legislatif untuk Wakil Rakyat\u2019 (Legislative Ethics for Elected Representatives), he said the code of ethics was also important to \u2018control\u2019 and \u2018discipline\u2019 elected representatives when taking part in debate sessions.\n\nRais said since Parliament is a place where the country\u2019s leaders are born, members must also consist of those with qualified academic qualifications and are well mannered.\n\nHowever, he said, in reality and based on the Parliament Hansard, the behavior, speech and debating style of elected representatives in the Malaysian Parliament was moving backward, he said, referring to the speech by three MPs who used offensive language in 2018.\n\nTherefore, Rais said changes in internal and external legislative work should be initiated, including the introduction of a code of ethics for the elected representatives that can be enforced in accordance with the Houses of Parliament (Privileges and Powers) Act 1952 (Act 347) or through the setting up of a special committee under Dewan Rakyat, Dewan Negara or state legislative assemblies.\n\nFor Dewan Negara, he said the motion to establish the code of ethics for elected representatives can be made under Standing Order 13 (2) 31 of the Senate.\n\nRais also suggested that training courses be given to MPs and assemblymen to ensure that they become elected representatives with integrity and have extensive legal knowledge.\n\n\u201cMake it mandatory for all elected representatives to undergo at least six months of training.

We propose postponing the relaxation to a time determined by a clear set of publicised criteria,\u201d Malaysia Health Coalition (MHC) said in a statement yesterday.\n\nThe coalition of medical experts added that at the moment, only 27% of the population of all ages were fully vaccinated, and this excludes undocumented migrants.\n\n\u201cChile only relaxed restrictions after 50% coverage, and Singapore is targeting relaxed restrictions at 70% coverage,\u201d MHC added.\n\nOn Sunday, Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin announced that among the restrictions being lifted for fully vaccinated individuals who reside in states under Phase 2 and above of the National Recovery Plan (NRP), include dine-ins, inter-district travel, sports and recreational activities without physical contact as well as tourism activities within the state involving homestays and hotels.\n\n\u201cIn allowing the relaxation, the government will also ensure public health strategic plans, which are now on the right track, continue to be implemented, especially through screenings, close contact detection, isolation measures, as well as improving healthcare capacity and treatment options,\u201d he said.\n\nMHC, however, stated that scientific and public health criteria for relaxation must be built by health experts without interference.\n\n\u201cThey can include \u2018fully vaccinated rate \u226570% of the total population, total critical care bed occupancy rate for Covid-19 of \u226490%, total daily new cases \u22644000 with share of positive tests \u22645%\u2019 and other criteria. These criteria must be publicised so that any future decisions will be solely based on evidence,\u201d MHC explained.\n\nAdditionally, the coalition said the government should clarify the specifics of these relaxed restrictions, because blanket vaccine privileges will create loopholes that will impede NRP.\n\n\u201cFor example, the government must answer questions like: What is the rationale to allow home quarantine for vaccinated travellers, how long is the quarantine and how will we monitor? How do we close the loopholes that may allow \u2018inter-state vacations on the pretext of visiting our children?\u2019\u201d it said.\n\nMeanwhile, Malaysian Medical Association (MMA) president Datuk Dr Subramaniam Muniandy said the decision to relax restrictions must be supported with sufficient scientific evidence.\n\n\u201cIf it is indeed a decision based on science, why then is travel allowed for those wishing to see their spouse or their young children? Either it\u2019s sufficiently safe for the fully vaccinated to travel, in which case all vaccinated individuals should be allowed to do so, or it is not, in which nobody should travel,\u201d he said.\n\nHe noted that some of those states in Phase 2 are showing an increasing trend in Covid-19 cases.\n\n\u201cThe government should stop its hyping up on the total number of cases. What is important are hospital bed utilisation and the intensive care units (ICUs) situation in the country,\u201d Dr Subramaniam said.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, we hope that the government will provide an update on the positivity rate and the status of bed utilisation and ICUs in each state as these will be more meaningful indicators apart from the daily new cases. It is important that the public be kept informed of the bed capacity and ICUs status in their respective state,\u201d he added.\n\nMMA also said that the lifting of restrictions must also take into account high-risk groups such as nursing homes, factory and construction workers, security guards, cleaners, medical students and undocumented migrant workers that have not been vaccinated.",

skin and hair.\n\nETX Daily Up is focussing on a few that should help convince you to either concoct your own treatments, or embrace some of the numerous cosmetic formulations based on this precious ingredient.\n\nCaffeine, an active ingredient that shouldn\u2019t be ignored\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon to find cosmetics formulated with caffeine, an active ingredient known for its slimming and firming benefits.\n\nGenerally, it is found in creams, gels, and other beauty products designed to help lose a few centimetres on the hips, thighs, or buttocks, as well as in anti-cellulite products or formulations designed to help users improve toning or firmness.\n\nBut caffeine is also present in certain facial care products, again with the aim of fighting skin slackening, but also \u2013 and above all \u2013 to improve the appearance of the eye contour area and reduce puffiness and dark circles (it can be even more effective if the product has spent some time in the refrigerator).\n\nCreams, gels, masks, cleansers: caffeine is nowadays found in products at all price points in the cosmetic departments of department stores and specialised shops.\n\nIn the form of powder and grounds\n\nWith the advent of DIY beauty, coffee now shows up in many so-called \u201chomemade\u201d recipes in the form of powder or grounds.\n\nRich in caffeine, these formulations can offer the advantages mentioned above, but are also powerful antioxidants, which allows them to fight against certain effects seen on mature skins, and more generally against skin aging.\n\nIn addition to these inherent virtues, coffee grounds, thanks to their specific texture, also make for a great exfoliant for sloughing off dead cells.\n\nAll you need to do is mix it with other ingredients: egg white for a mask, vegetable oil and honey for a face and body scrub, or even on its own to exfoliate scalp and hair to make it shinier.\n\nOver on TikTok, known for being the go-to social network for DIY beauty recipes, one can also discover a multitude of recipes for masks and scrubs made from soluble coffee or coffee beans.\n\nRecipes that users seem to have not only tested but also

collaborating with GE Digital on aircraft fuel efficiency monitoring solutions as part of the carrier\u2019s initiatives to meet its sustainability goals.\n\nThe national flag carrier adopted GE Digital\u2019s Fuel Insight and FlightPulse aviation software to transform and modernise the airline\u2019s fuel efficiency programme.\n\nMAB has implemented various initiatives including efficiency measures, investments in sustainability solutions and waste reduction across its operations to address its sustainability goals.\n\nThe fuel efficiency programme has been running for over a decade, contributing to a 15% fuel burn improvement recorded over the past eight years.\n\nMAB\u2019s group operations officer, Ahmad Luqman Mohd Azmi, stated promoting sustainability in all of the MAB\u2019s operations has always been a top priority.\n\nHe said digitalisation is a core component of the airlines\u2019 long term business plan and such efforts bring immediate value especially in the area of fuel efficiency.\n\n\u201cWe are looking forward to such a partnership that contributes to the airline\u2019s efforts to accelerate our sustainability target.\n\n\u201cThrough these solutions, we seek to play a greater part in building a legacy for future generations and enhancing our own airline\u2019s sustainability efforts,\u201d Ahmad Luqman said in a statement yesterday.\n\nFuel Insight is a cost and emissions monitoring solution that works by understanding data from the aircraft to uncover valuable intelligence that helps increase fuel efficiency and reduce waste.\n\nIt also gives operators actionable intelligence at multiple levels allowing analysts to drill down macro trends to understand issues on a per-flight level.\n\nThe software uses GE Digital\u2019s Event Measurement System (EMS) aviation data and analytics platform to merge flight data with flight plans, load sheets and fuel uplift data, identify the most attainable fuel savings opportunities, and track the incremental savings across the operation.\n\nFlightPulse, meanwhile, puts data directly into the hands of pilots, allowing them to visualise their savings over time.\n\nPilots who understand their own performance can adjust their flight plans to maximise safety and fuel efficiency.\n\nSecure benchmarking and data sharing allows crew members to see their contribution to projects and dramatically shortens the feedback loop.\n\nMAB evaluated the software with an extensive team of pilots, dispatchers and analysts who endorsed the software solution, which is hosted on GE Digital\u2019s EMS platform.\n\nEMS is built on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform providing compute, data, and security services.\n\nGE Digital\u2019s GM of the aviation software business Andrew Coleman said the company is committed to environmental excellence and that includes ensuring its customers are empowered to reduce the impact of their technology and environmental footprint within their operations.\n\n\u201cThese solutions will help MAB to leverage software to improve efficiency and reduce carbon emissions,\u201d Coleman added.\n\nThe solution will be implemented by the GE Digital aviation software teams in Austin, Texas and Shanghai, China.\n\nAdditionally, GE Digital provides MAB with the tools to build its big data analytics and leverage modern tools for data analysis

But fans in Malaysia have something to look forward to as two locals are working on a real-life version of the game \u2013 and this time, you can finally taste your veggies.\n\nWith the help of artificial intelligence and, in the near future, drones, Aquaville Asia hopes to become the world\u2019s first aquaponics farm where subscribers can nurture actual crops through their phones.\n\nFeeling like kale this week but kangkung the next? No problem, just tap on your screen and come harvest day, you will be greeted at your doorstep with fresh greens harvested from your own aquaponic plot.\n\nThat\u2019s the plan, at least \u2013 but for the time being, the concept is already in motion where subscribers can get five packs of vegetables delivered four times a month, with optional tilapia fish.\n\nAquaville founder Chia Weng Yan tells FMT that the idea came to him in the middle of the night. \u201cI dreamt about it and jotted down \u2018FarmVille in real life\u2019,\u201d the 40-year-old says.\n\n\u201cI created a pitch deck for it thinking it was a great idea, but didn\u2019t execute it and kept it on my computer for a long time,\u201d he adds, explaining that he struggled to find someone with the technological know-how to make his literal dream a reality.\n\nThen, in July last year, Chia found the perfect person for the job.\n\nLoke Chung Eng had posted on Facebook about robotics and projects involving IOT, or \u201cinternet of things\u201d, a network of physical objects embedded with sensors, software and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data.\n\nA phone call later and Chia had joined forces with Loke, 33, to create Aquaville Asia. The duo worked for months on the concept.\n\nWhile Loke spent time programming the AI system, Chia reached out to urban farmers, friends and family members to get them on board.\n\nThe duo forged an alliance with AHA Services Malaysia, a farm run by urban agriculturalists who provide Aquaville with all their farming requirements, including maintenance, harvest and delivery of fresh produce to subscribers.\n\nChia and Loke leave the farming to these experts and do their share by equipping the farm with Aquaville\u2019s AI technology.\n\n\u201cWe provide them with smart-farm capabilities so if any subscriptions come in, they are ready to harvest and deliver the produce,\u201d Chia explains.\n\nHe adds that using AI, Loke created a way to spot diseases in crops using an NDVI camera that scans vegetables at different wavelengths \u201cso you know if they are dying ahead of time\u201d.\n\nThe AI system can even monitor pH levels, humidity, heat and water levels. All their crops are pesticide-free.\n\nAquaville was officially launched in January this year, and subscribers have been effusive about how lush and crisp their vegetables are, compared with those bought in a store.\n\nSome customers have also funnelled their harvests to the needy, among them three companies that donated to a special-needs home in Petaling Jaya \u2013 sending bundles of fresh greens to feed 74 children between January and June \u2013 as well as contributed towards the white flag movement.\n\nIn the near future, Chia and Loke aim to introduce an application and drone system that will swoop over crops and capture real-time footage. Subscribers will be able to monitor their greens and control them through the app.\n\nAdditionally, the duo hope to empower the less fortunate and provide deaf, mute and B40 families with job opportunities on the farm.\n\nIt may take a few years for this FarmVille dream to fully become a reality, but the Aquaville innovators are hopeful and looking forward to a bright and greener future.\n\nFor fresh produce at your door each week or to help the needy, contact Aquaville Asia via Facebook or check out their website.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["taste", "malaysias", "veggies", "provide", "ai", "loke", "crops", "system", "chia", "aquaville", "farmville", "subscribers", "fresh", "vegetables"], "summary": "PETALING JAYA: Thousands were left cropless and devastated last year when Zynga\u2019s popular game FarmVille announced the end of its 11-year legacy.\nBut fans in Malaysia have something to look forward to as two locals are working on a real-life version of the game \u2013 and this time, you can finally taste your veggies.\nAquaville founder Chia Weng Yan tells FMT that the idea came to him in the middle of the night.\nWhile Loke spent time programming the AI system, Chia reached out to urban farmers, friends and family members to get them on board.\nThe AI system can even monitor pH levels, humidity, heat and water levels.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-08-12 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "1989 Proton Black Knight Wins \u201cUnexceptional\u201d Award In UK Car Festival", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL2Z1bi8yMDIxLzA4LzAzLzE5ODktcHJvdG9uLWJsYWNrLWtuaWdodC13aW5zLXVuZXhjZXB0aW9uYWwtYXdhcmQtaW4tdWstY2FyLWZlc3RpdmFsL9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL2Z1bi8yMDIxLzA4LzAzLzE5ODktcHJvdG9uLWJsYWNrLWtuaWdodC13aW5zLXVuZXhjZXB0aW9uYWwtYXdhcmQtaW4tdWstY2FyLWZlc3RpdmFsL2FtcC8?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Azizul Rahman Ismail", "Maya Suraya"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Proton-Black-Knight.jpeg", "text": "Subscribe to our new Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates.\n\nThe Proton Saga is Malaysia\u2019s first car and was the symbol of the nation\u2019s success. It says so in the jingle, if you are old enough to remember it.\n\nIntroduced in 1985, the name Saga was theorised to have a double meaning.\n\nIn English, it is defined as a long story of heroic achievement.\n\nIn Malay, it refers to the Adenanthera tree. The colour of its bright and deep red seeds was the inspiration for the signature hue of the national car.\n\nHowever, the reality is, the name \u201cSaga\u201d was the winning entry in a competition held in 1984.\n\nThe winner, Staf Sarjan Ismail Jaafar said that the name is actually an acronym for Safety, Achievement, Greatness, and Ability.\n\nThey Don\u2019t Make Them Like They Used To\n\nThe first generation Saga had many iterations and was in production up to 1992.\n\nOne of its most notable versions of the Saga was a hatchback released in 1987 during the peak of popularity of a certain TV show starring a certain modified Pontiac Trans Am.\n\nThe hatchback was called the Proton Knight. It was later named Proton Saga Aeroback, perhaps for copyright reasons.

Lots of things are being said,\u201d he said as PSG laboured to a 2-1 win over Troyes in their opening game of the new league season.\n\nJorge Sampaoli, the Argentine coach of PSG\u2019s bitter rivals Marseille, said the arrival of Messi can only be good news for French football.\n\n\u201cIt would be great for Ligue 1, he\u2019s the best player in the world,\u201d said Sampaoli.\n\n\u201cFrench football has won a lot and grown a lot in recent seasons.\n\n\u201cEven if he goes to a club other than Marseille, it will be good.

year\u2019s Merdeka will be like no other, courtesy of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nWith most of the Klang Valley and other urban centres under strict lockdown, the usual display of patriotic sentiments will be somewhat drowned out by the pervasive gloom of the moment.\n\nYet, 27 artists have chosen to express their love for the country during the month of Merdeka by displaying their works in an online exhibition titled very simply \u201cJalur Gemilang\u201d.\n\nOpen for viewing until the end of the month, the exhibition is hosted by Artas Galeri, an art gallery based in Petaling Jaya.\n\nAccording to Roy Ng, Artas Galeri\u2019s director, plans were already underway to hold a physical Merdeka-themed exhibition in the months leading up to August.\n\nHowever, with the extension of MCO 3.0, it became painfully clear that Plan B would have to be executed.\n\n\u201cDue to the pandemic and the increasing number of cases, I decided to launch an online show with an e-catalogue instead,\u201d he said.\n\nThat way, art enthusiasts will still be able to view the art pieces themselves without leaving the safety of their homes.\n\n\u201cMost of these artists\u2019 works exhibited in the \u2018Jalur Gemilang\u2019 exhibition are based on our national flag\u2019s colours,\u201d Ng said, adding that a majority of them used copious amounts of red, yellow, blue and white in multiple art styles including abstract, still-life and figurative.\n\nAccording to him, the artists are a fascinating group made up of graduates fresh out of art school as well as senior artists who have made a name for themselves in the art world.\n\nFMT had the pleasure of interviewing six of the artists regarding their hopes for the country this Merdeka month.\n\nYuki Lim Xiao Mun, artist of the almost ethereal \u201cThe Paradise Land\u201d, had this to say: \u201cMy hope for this Merdeka month is that our country can be restored to good condition after the economic hardship caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nShe said it was also her sincere hope that Malaysia\u2019s leaders will lead the country down the right path by practising integrity in their leadership.\n\nLikewise, Fadzril Fakaruddin encouraged Malaysians to stay united no matter what the circumstances, so that together, they could be free of Covid-19 for good.\n\nWhile Hamir Soib hopes for better governance, fellow artist Najib Ahmad Bamadhaj is hopeful for a return to normalcy and the good \u2018ol pre-Covid days.\n\nNational unity is something that veteran artist, Awang Damit, believes is vital if the country is to survive these difficult times.\n\nAnd another artist, Zulkefli Talha, reminded Malaysians to love each other as fellow countrymen regardless of racial or religious differences.\n\n\u201cLeaders have to be good examples for the people. And both leaders and the people have to work together to end this pandemic and return Malaysia to its former glory.\u201d\n\nNg told FMT that the pandemic had been especially tough on many artists. The numerous lockdowns this past year and a half meant potential buyers were unable to view the artworks personally and as a consequence, there was little to no sales.\n\nHe said there was an urgent need for artists to find alternative avenues to display their work so that they could continue to earn a decent living.\n\nNg explained that things have not been looking up for artists for a while now. Prior to the pandemic, the sluggish economy meant artists struggled to make a sale. The lockdowns brought about by the pandemic, only made things worse.\n\n\u201cMost collectors and buyers prefer to see the pieces in person. There\u2019s a huge difference between seeing artworks personally and virtually,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen you view an artwork physically, you will be able to see the texture, notice the colour tones and spot the little details. That\u2019s something these virtual exhibitions sadly cannot offer.\u201d\n\nHowever, this has not dampened the spirit of art collectors such as Brendan Siva in regard to the \u201cJalur Gemilang\u201d exhibition.\n\n\u201cEach piece is unique as an individual interpretation and expression of what Malaysia represents and symbolises in the eyes of the artist.

So it\u2019s just like dance.\u201d\n\nEach scene will be discussed and rehearsed beforehand, away from the glare of the dozens of people usually present on a set.\n\n\u201cWhen the camera rolls or they\u2019re up on stage, they know they can perform that intimate contact, knowing where they\u2019re going to be touched,\u201d she says.\n\nAt the heart of her philosophy is consent, in an industry which has been rocked in recent years by sexual assault claims. Her motto, which she says she often repeats to actors, is: \u201cYour \u2018no\u2019 is a gift. Tell us your \u2018no\u2019, so that we can trust your \u2018yes'\u201d.\n\n\u2018Incredibly hard\u2019\n\nO\u2019Brien was a dancer in the theatre for 10 years and then an actress for eight before she sensed an opportunity and became an intimacy coordinator in 2014.\n\nIt was a pioneering move at a time when actors\u2019 consent was little talked about, and before the #MeToo movement against sexual abuse and sexual harassment.\n\nBefore then, \u201cif an actor ever said \u2018no\u2019, they\u2019d be a troublemaker or a diva, and they would certainly be worried about losing their job,\u201d she recalls.\n\nIn such an environment, she describes her early days in the role as \u201cincredibly hard\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had productions where I\u2019ve been told not to speak to the director,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m serving the director\u2019s vision, but the director doesn\u2019t want to speak to me because he\u2019s a 74-year-old man, who basically doesn\u2019t want to acknowledge my existence.\u201d\n\nOn other occasions, she was not allowed on the set because the actors or director did not want her help.\n\nAttitudes have since changed a lot. The profession is becoming more popular and O\u2019Brien is in high demand, especially after Michaela Coel dedicated her best actress BAFTA win this year for \u201cI May Destroy You\u201d to her.\n\n\u201cThank you, Ita, for making a space safe, for creating physical, emotional and professional boundaries, so we can make work about exploitation, loss of respect, about abuse of powers, without being exploited or abused in the process,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["stars", "sexual", "ita", "obrien", "indemand", "intimacy", "process", "coordinator", "scenes", "sex", "actor",

Covid jabs per day and are moving towards increasing to 20,000 doses per day. \u2014 Picture by Sayuti Zainudin\n\nFollow us on Instagram and subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates.\n\nGEORGE TOWN, Aug 1 \u2014 Factories and small businesses in Penang, especially those hard hit by disruptions due to the Covid-19 pandemic, are looking forward to resuming operations as soon as possible even if it means making vaccination mandatory for their workers.\n\nAs there are currently no laws to enforce mandatory Covid-19 vaccination on workers, some companies are taking steps to get their workers to register for vaccination.\n\nPenang Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM) chairman Datuk Jimmy Ong said most factories here are encouraging their workers to register for their Covid jabs through various methods.\n\n\u201cSome companies are giving paid leave to their workers to go for vaccination and some are even offering monetary rewards,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the main reason multinational companies (MNC) are setting up Program Imunisasi Industri Covid-19 Kerjasama Awam-Swasta (Pikas) vaccination centres within their own factory grounds is to encourage their workers to get vaccinated.\n\nHe said the Pikas PPVs in Penang are now dispensing 15,000 doses per day and are moving towards increasing to 20,000 doses per day.\n\nHe said the vaccination of workers in MNCs is progressing very fast due to the on-site PPVs for larger factories which employ thousands of workers.\n\n\u201cIt is slower for small medium enterprises as they can only send their workers to the Pikas PPVs and there are only two of those now; one in Jawi and one at Equatorial Hotel,\u201d he said.\n\nEven with vaccination in full force, Ong said some of the companies in the manufacturing sector have continued to conduct screening of workers every two to three weeks.\n\n\u201cScreening still has to continue to control any potential spread of cases within the factories because we know, even those vaccinated still have a risk of contracting Covid-19,\u201d he said.\n\nFMM Penang branch offers a Penang SAFE programme for factories to conduct screening tests for its workers at a lower rate of RM60 per person.\n\nOng said the programme recommends that any company taking up the package conduct screening of 100 per cent of its staff in the first round.\n\n\u201cAfter that, they can conduct screening on 20 per cent of their staff for the second round and another 20 per cent on the third round, and so on,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, one of the SMEs in Penang, Chemdyes Sdn Bhd, has checked labour laws on ways to compel its employees to get vaccinated.\n\nThe company\u2019s managing director Joe Sidek said it was informed that there are at present no laws for the company to compel its employees to register for vaccination.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t legally force them to register for vaccination, it is a personal right, so what we do is to encourage them to do it as a way to safeguard everyone\u2019s safety in the workplace,\u201d he said.\n\nThe factory, specialising in textile chemicals, has about 22 workers and Joe said all have registered for vaccination.\n\nA nurse administers a dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at the Pikas vaccination centre at the Bukit Jawi Golf Resort in Penang June 17, 2021. \u2014 Picture by Sayuti Zainudin\n\nHe said despite the downturn in the textile industry due to the pandemic, Chemdyes recorded stable revenue last year and expects an increase in revenue this year.\n\n\u201cWe have kept all our staff and did not cut any pay so we have been very fortunate and we want to ensure that everyone is safe, we do not want to have any cases that could disrupt production,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said he would allow his workers to stay home for a week and to undergo screening tests if they have been exposed to places with a high number of Covid-19 cases.\n\nMeanwhile, it was reported that the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) is considering making vaccination of all employees in the retail sector one of the pre-conditions for approval for companies to resume operation, during the National Recovery Plan (NRP) period.\n\nYin\u2019s Sourdough Bakery and cafe co-founder Ong Seng Keat has already made it compulsory for all of its 40 workers to sign up for vaccination.\n\n\u201cWe will check our workers\u2019 MySejahtera to make sure they have registered and if we have to pay for it, we will,\u201d he said.\n\nHis company has already paid for all of his workers in Klang Valley to be vaccinated under a retail industry vaccination programme.\n\nHe hopes such programmes will be available in Penang so he can send all his workers to be vaccinated as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cThe government really needs to speed up its vaccination programme for the economic frontliners because we deal with people every day,\u201d he said.\n\nMugshot Cafe co-founder Jesse Tan agrees with Ong that vaccination for economic frontliners should be sped up.\n\n\u201cSo far, all of our staff have registered for vaccination but they are still waiting for their appointments,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of Mugshot\u2019s staff contracted Covid-19 a few months back due to close contact with a relative but fortunately, it did not spread to the other staff in the cafe.\n\n\u201cThere are 15 of us in the cafe and all of us went for screening the moment we found out he was positive but luckily, we were all negative,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the incident further emphasises the importance of vaccination for all workers who deal with customers daily.\n\nAs for Hin Bus Depot manager Tan Shih Thoe, he is also considering only allowing fully vaccinated vendors to participate in the Hin Bus Depot weekly bazaar, when they are finally allowed to reopen.\n\n\u201cI was just thinking about this, especially for the market, whether I should only allow vendors who are fully vaccinated to participate... main consideration is their safety since the market is considered a crowded space,\u201d he said.\n\nThere used to be 70 vendors at the weekly market before the pandemic but due to standard operating procedures (SOPs), the number of vendors came down to around 55 each week.\n\nThe market has been closed for more than two months due to the movement control order (MCO) and subsequent phases of the NRP.\n\nHin Bus Depot has around 15 tenants, consisting of eateries and artisans, and Tan said he will also strongly encourage the tenants and their workers to register for vaccination.\n\n\u201cMost of them are in favour of vaccination as they see it as the only solution to things getting back to normal,\u201d he said.\n\nFurry Kids pet shop owner Dalbinder Singh also agrees that it is important for those in the retail sector to be vaccinated.\n\n\u201cWe are meeting people and customers daily so it is important for the safety of everyone,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, he said it would be infringing on the individual\u2019s human rights to force workers to register for vaccination so he can only encourage them to do so.\n\n\u201cFortunately, all of my staff have registered but they are still waiting... I am also still waiting for my appointment,\u201d he said.\n\nHe too said vaccination for retail workers should be sped up since they face customers daily.", "keyword": ["register", "vaccination", "manufacturing", "ong", "pikas", "workers", "services", "support", "staff", "sectors", "employers", "screening", "mandate", "covid19", "vaccinated", "penang", "vaccine"], "summary": "As there are currently no laws to enforce mandatory Covid-19 vaccination on workers, some companies are taking steps to get their workers to register for vaccination.\nPenang Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM) chairman Datuk Jimmy Ong said most factories here are encouraging their workers to register for their Covid jabs through various methods.\nHe said the vaccination of workers in MNCs is progressing very fast due to the on-site PPVs for larger factories which employ thousands of workers.\nFMM Penang branch offers a Penang SAFE programme for factories to conduct screening tests for its workers at a lower rate of RM60 per person.\nA nurse administers a dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at the Pikas vaccination centre at the Bukit Jawi Golf Resort in Penang June 17, 2021.", "news": "Malay Mail", "date": "2021-08-01 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Can employers make COVID-19 vaccinations mandatory for all staff?

Here\u2019s what you need to know:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Can employers make vaccination compulsory for employees?\n\nEmployment lawyer Donovan Cheah said there is no law now that disallows mandatory vaccination policies by employers, and that there are no known court cases in the country about whether such a policy would be legal.\n\n\u201cGiven the severity of the pandemic, having a mandatory vaccination policy is one of the ways for employers to safeguard the safety and health of their employees and curb the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cHowever, there are no reported court cases in Malaysia about the legality of mandatory vaccination policies, and whether an employer can take disciplinary action against an employee for refusing to vaccinate,\u201d he said, but noted there have been reported cases in countries like Australia and the US which upheld the dismissal of employees who refuse to comply with their employer\u2019s mandatory vaccination policy.\n\nSpecialist employment lawyer Marcus van Geyzel said employers would generally be able to make it compulsory for their employees to undergo COVID-19 vaccination if this is due to a government-imposed requirement.\n\n\u201cYes, if the MDTCA/KPDNHEP makes employee vaccinations mandatory or a pre-condition for approval to operate, the affected employers can impose this requirement on employees,\u201d he told Malay Mail.\n\n\u201cHowever, employers should be cautious where there are special circumstances, such as where an employee is unable to receive a vaccination due to a medical condition,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIn general, it would be very unlikely for an employee to successfully challenge an employer\u2019s mandatory vaccination policy where vaccinations have been declared a pre-condition for operations by the government.\n\nIn order to bring a successful legal action, an employee would have to show that in mandating vaccination, the employer has exercised its managerial power in a non-genuine manner, or that there was victimisation or an unfair labour practice,\u201d he said.\n\n2. What if the employees say no to vaccination?\n\nCheah said employers can choose to take disciplinary action against employees who refuse vaccination, and that whether such action is reasonable depends on the situation.\n\n\u201cWhile an employer cannot physically compel an employee to take the vaccine, an employee\u2019s freedom of choice is not the same thing as freedom from consequences. There are no legal prohibitions against an employer implementing a mandatory vaccination policy, although how employers deal with breaches of this policy may be evaluated by the courts,\u201d he said.\n\nCheah said disciplinary action including dismissal may be seen as reasonable, taking into account various factors.\n\nHe listed examples such as the employee\u2019s reason for refusal; whether the employee\u2019s refusal amounts to a breach of their duties or has caused loss or damage to the company or other employees; whether the employee\u2019s job function requires him/her to have regular and frequent physical interaction with third parties.\n\nOther factors listed by Cheah are the current severity of the pandemic; whether the employer\u2019s business deals with high-risk individuals; and whether vaccination is a pre-condition from the authorities for the employer to operate.\n\n\u201cWhere an employee has a legitimate reason to refuse vaccination (eg: health condition), employers should explore other ways to address the risk, such as requiring them to carry out their duties remotely and not allowing them to enter the premises without notice,\u201d Cheah added.\n\nVan Geyzel said employers would have several options, when vaccinations are a precondition for operations but there are employees who refuse to get vaccinated.\n\nThese options are to engage with the employees, or to transfer employees to alternative roles, or to ultimately stop employing the employee.\n\n\u201cThe first step should always be for employers to have clear and open conversations with these employees to ensure that they understand the reason for the vaccination requirement.\n\n\u201cEmployers can also consider redesignating or redeploying the affected employees to other roles within the business which are not customer-facing and which may be exempted from the regulatory requirements,\u201d he said.\n\nIf redesignation and redeployment is not an option, employers would be legally able to terminate the employee\u2019s employment if it is reasonable in the circumstances, he said.\n\nVan Geyzel said there is a general legal expectation that an employee has to follow all lawful and reasonable instructions by the employer.\n\nHe added that it can be argued that an employee is carrying out an act of insubordination by refusing to be vaccinated under the circumstances, as the employee is wilfully disobeying a lawful and reasonable order issued by the employer.\n\n\u201cAny punishment or action by the employer in response to insubordination has to be reasonable or proportionate, and it can be said here that where the result of the employee\u2019s vaccination is that the business would not be allowed to operate, there are serious repercussions and therefore termination of employment is a reasonable response by the employer.\n\n\u201cAnother potential justification for termination of employment is that an unvaccinated employee would be unable to perform the job or service for which the employee was employed. This would be the case if an unvaccinated employee is not permitted by law to work.\n\n\u201cIn such a situation, it may be reasonable for an employer to deem that the employment contract cannot be performed and therefore can be terminated,\u201d he said.\n\n3. What if an employee says no to vaccination due to health conditions?\n\nAs for employees who are unable to receive COVID-19 vaccinations due to a medical condition, van Geyzel said employers could explore measures such as redesignation.\n\n\u201cFirstly, I don\u2019t think the government would make vaccinations mandatory for such employees.\n\n\u201cSecondly, even if the government issued a blanket requirement, the employer should see if it\u2019s possible to apply for an exemption for that employee, or again see if redeployment or redesignation is an option.\n\n\u201cTermination should always be a last resort, but if the employer has acted reasonably, then termination should be possible under the law,\u201d he said, also saying that an employee would be unlikely to succeed in an unfair dismissal claim if an employer treated the employee fairly and could show that the termination was reasonable in the circumstances.\n\nFor employees with pre-existing health conditions that prevent them from being vaccinated, employment lawyer Jayasingam Poopalasingam said employers can seek to take mitigation measures such as changing their work roles or have them work remotely.\n\nHowever, if the nature of the business and nature of the employee\u2019s work requires vaccination, but vaccination is not possible due to the health condition and mitigating measures are not feasible through no fault of both the employer or the employee, the employer may be left with no choice but to terminate employment.\n\nThe employee could under such circumstances file a complaint to claim that the dismissal was without just cause and excuse, but it would ultimately be for the Industrial Court to decide if the dismissal was with just cause and excuse, he said.\n\n4. Putting it into the employment contract and putting it in writing\n\nJayasingam, who is also co-chair of the Bar Council\u2019s Industrial and Employment Law Committee, similarly said there are currently no laws that mandate COVID-19 vaccination for employees.\n\nThis means that for existing employees, an employer cannot \u201cforce\u201d them to be vaccinated, but can only seek to persuade and convince the employee of the need to be vaccinated due to reasons such as the nature of the work.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing much you can do, you cannot force the employee to go for vaccination, you cannot force an employee to undergo a medical procedure, it has to be by way of consent,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf they are existing employees, it must be by way of consent. They have a right to refuse vaccination, that\u2019s why we advise employers to obtain the written consent of employees to be vaccinated,\u201d he said, explaining that a mere verbal consent is not advisable as an employee could later claim to have never given consent.\n\nFor employees who pose a high risk due to the nature of their job as a frontliner or being in contact with others but refuse vaccination, employers can transfer them to another position where they do not deal with customers or other employees, he said.\n\nBut for new employees, an employer can make being vaccinated against COVID-19 a part of the employment contract prior to them joining the company, he said.\n\n\u201cYou cannot force it but what you can do is if you are having new employees, you can put it as a term of the contract, where they must be vaccinated before they are hired for employment, or they must undertake they will be vaccinated after they join you,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the new recruit would have the option of not joining the company upon viewing the contract, while employers can terminate employment if the new hire subsequently does not comply with instructions to be vaccinated as promised under the contract.\n\n5. About legal action\n\nIf an employer forces an employee to undergo COVID-19 vaccination, the employee can possibly walk out of the job and try to claim \u201cconstructive dismissal\u201d, Jayasingam said.\n\nIn cases of constructive dismissal claims, the employer does not have to issue a letter of termination, but the employee is essentially claiming that the employer has done something in breach of his contractual rights and that the employer\u2019s conduct had resulted in the employee\u2019s resignation.\n\nSuch an employee could then seek to prove their case in the Industrial Court to claim for monetary compensation and reinstatement to the job with all previous benefits and rights unaffected, including the right to not be forced to be vaccinated, Jayasingam said. It would ultimately be for the Industrial Court to decide if there was constructive dismissal.\n\nAlternatively, employees can also file a claim in civil courts but this is usually not preferred as the compensation is very small, with most employees likely to go to the Industrial Court instead, he said.\n\nUnlike new employees who have agreed to being vaccinated under the employment contract and can be terminated for non-compliance, Jayasingam said employers could face labour complaints by existing employees if the latter are terminated over their non-vaccinated status.\n\n\u201cIf the employer terminates them for not being vaccinated, the employee can file a complaint of dismissal without just cause and excuse,\u201d he said, explaining the process as involving employees filing complaints with the Industrial Relations Department under the Human Resources Ministry within 60 days of dismissal to see whether it could be resolved amicably, with the matter to be referred by the department director-general to the Industrial Court if it cannot be resolved.\n\nBut in situations where it is a government requirement for staff to be vaccinated in order to operate, an employer may have reason to terminate an employee who refuses to get vaccinated if it affects the business, Jayasingam said.\n\n\u201cSo the employer may have just cause and excuse to terminate the employee because he cannot carry on business,\u201d he said.\n\nJayasingam gave a hypothetical example, where an employee who works as a carer at a nursing home refuses to be vaccinated when it is a government requirement for such work, and the carer may as a result pose a risk to the elderly persons at the nursing home.\n\nIn such a situation and where there are no mitigation measures possible, the employer \u2014 who is unable to force the employee to be vaccinated \u2014 may opt to terminate the employee as it affects the business or may result in the nursing home having to be closed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s for the Industrial Court to decide whether what the employer did was reasonable or not,\u201d he said.\n\n6. Can the government make COVID-19 vaccination mandatory for employees?\n\nVan Geyzel said there may be a stronger basis for a compulsory vaccination requirement by the government for certain industries.\n\n\u201cThe laws that have been passed in response to the pandemic grant the government very broad powers to impose SOPs or pre-conditions for businesses to operate, and when it comes to roles or industries that have clear and frequent face-to-face contact and interaction with the general public, there is a stronger justification for the authorities to impose mandatory vaccination requirements. This is especially so as vaccinations are widely available and accessible.\n\n\u201cHowever, if the government overreaches and tries to impose mandatory vaccinations on other roles or industries where there is no clear face-to-face interaction or risk, I could see this being open to legal challenge,\u201d he said.\n\nJayasingam said the government could impose mandatory vaccinations on the general population including employees by passing an Act in Parliament, but believes that implementing such a policy of forcing vaccinations would only be a \u201clast resort.\u201d \u2014 Malay Mail", "keyword": ["vaccination", "employee", "employer", "say", "staff", "heres", "employers", "lawyers", "employees", "employment", "mandatory", "covid19", "vaccinated", "reasonable", "vaccinations"], "summary": "\u201cYes, if the MDTCA/KPDNHEP makes employee vaccinations mandatory or a pre-condition for approval to operate, the affected employers can impose this requirement on employees,\u201d he told Malay Mail.\n\u201cIn general, it would be very unlikely for an employee to successfully challenge an employer\u2019s mandatory vaccination policy where vaccinations have been declared a pre-condition for operations by the government.\n\u201cFirstly, I don\u2019t think the government would make vaccinations mandatory for such employees.\nCan the government make COVID-19 vaccination mandatory for employees?\n\u201cHowever, if the government overreaches and tries to impose mandatory vaccinations on other roles or industries where there is no clear face-to-face interaction or risk, I could see this being open to legal challenge,\u201d he said.", "news": "SoyaCincau.com", "date": "2021-08-02 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Ministry mulls proposal to control price of Covid-19 test kit", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbGF5bWFpbC5jb20vbmV3cy9tYWxheXNpYS8yMDIxLzA4LzAzL21pbmlzdHJ5LW11bGxzLXByb3Bvc2FsLXRvLWNvbnRyb2wtcHJpY2Utb2YtY292aWQtMTktdGVzdC1raXQvMTk5NDkwMtIBfGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbGF5bWFpbC5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wOC8wMy9taW5pc3RyeS1tdWxscy1wcm9wb3NhbC10by1jb250cm9sLXByaWNlLW9mLWNvdmlkLTE5LXRlc3Qta2l0LzE5OTQ5MDI?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://media2.malaymail.com/resize_cache/uploads/articles/2021/2021-07/covid_test_kit2_26072021-seo.jpg", "text": "Deputy Minister Datuk Rosol Wahid said based on feedback from the public, the test kit price is a burden especially to the low-income groups and families with many children. \u2014 Bernama pic\n\nFollow us on Instagram and subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates.\n\nKUALA BERANG, Aug 3 \u2015 The Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) is considering a proposal to control the price of the Covid-19 test kit, said Deputy Minister Datuk Rosol Wahid.\n\nHe said based on feedback from the public, the test kit price is a burden especially to the low-income groups and families with many children.\n\n\u201cWe were told that the price is RM39.90 each, not many can afford to buy it at that price.

Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on household income and made more people poorer, according to a study conducted by the Department of Statistics.\n\nThe Covid-19 impact study on household income in Malaysia for 2020 revealed that the number of poor households increased to 639,800 in 2020, up from 405,400 in 2019.\n\nThe findings of the study are contained in the Household Income Estimates and Incidence of Poverty Report, Malaysia, 2020 which the department released today.\n\nChief Statistician Datuk Seri Dr Mohd Uzir Mahidin said in a statement that the incidence of absolute poverty also increased, from 5.6 per cent in 2019 to 8.4 per cent in 2020, and that the incidence of hardcore poverty is estimated to increase from 0.4 per cent (2019) involving 27,200 households to 1.0 per cent involving 78,000 households.\n\nHe said the pandemic had also affected the structure of household groups, with 20 per cent of households from the M40 group with income between RM4,850 and RM10,959 having moved to the B40 group.\n\n\u201cHouseholds in the T20 group were also affected by the Covid-19 pandemic where 12.8 per cent of this group has shifted to the M40 group,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also said that as the percentage decrease in income for B40 and M40 households was larger than the T20 households group, the income distribution for B40 and M40 declined to 15.9 per cent (2019: 16.0 per cent) and 36.9 per cent (2019: 37.2 per cent), respectively.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the T20 group owned 47.2 per cent of income increased by 0.4 percentage points from 2019,\u201d he added.\n\nMohd Uzir said the mean of monthly household gross income decreased by negative 10.3 per cent to record RM7,089 as compared to RM7,901 in 2019 and added that the decline was contributed by households or individuals who experienced loss or reduction of income, particularly those with the status of employee, self-employed and others.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, this reduction of income was not only caused by job loss but also contributed by the reduction of working hours and increase in skill-related underemployment,\u201d he said.\n\nMohd Uzir said that all territories/states recorded a decline in mean and median of monthly household gross income. The Federal Territory of Putrajaya registered the lowest reduction in monthly household income and remained to record the highest mean and median of monthly household gross income as compared to other territories/states with RM12,322 and RM9,743, respectively.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, Kelantan remained to record the lowest mean and median income with RM4,411 and RM3,010, respectively,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also said that the incidence of absolute poverty by state shows that Sabah recorded the highest percentage of 25.3 per cent (2019: 19.5 per cent) while Kelantan recorded a significant increase in poverty by 8.8 percentage points to 21.2 per cent from 12.4 per cent (2019), followed by Terengganu by 5.9 percentage points to 12 per cent from 6.1 per cent (2019).\n\nMohd Uzir said the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic may be temporary as the economy is expected to improve and recover as the spread of the pandemic can be contained.\n\n\u201cFrom this analysis, it is found that the role of the federal and state governments as well as other relevant parties is pertinent in cushioning the impact of the pandemic as well as towards reviving the household income and the country\u2019s economy,\u201d he said.- Bernama", "keyword": ["study", "households", "poverty", "2019", "income", "household", "cent", "covid19", "uzir", "impact", "pandemic", "reveals", "percentage", "group", "significant"], "summary": "KUALA LUMPUR: The Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on household income and made more people poorer, according to a study conducted by the Department of Statistics.\nThe Covid-19 impact study on household income in Malaysia for 2020 revealed that the number of poor households increased to 639,800 in 2020, up from 405,400 in 2019.\nThe findings of the study are contained in the Household Income Estimates and Incidence of Poverty Report, Malaysia, 2020 which the department released today.\nMohd Uzir said that all territories/states recorded a decline in mean and median of monthly household gross income.\nThe Federal Territory of Putrajaya registered the lowest reduction in monthly household income and remained to record the highest mean and median of monthly household gross income as compared to other territories/states with RM12,322 and RM9,743, respectively.", "news": "The Sun Daily", "date": "2021-08-06 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Sir Shakib started Project SOP initiative to keep the rakyat safe at PPV queues", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVzdW5kYWlseS5teS9zdHlsZS1saWZlL2dvaW5nLXZpcmFsL3Npci1zaGFraWItc3RhcnRlZC1wcm9qZWN0LXNvcC1pbml0aWF0aXZlLXRvLWtlZXAtdGhlLXJha3lhdC1zYWZlLWF0LXBwdi1xdWV1ZXMtSE44MTk3ODEw0gEA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://www.thesundaily.my/binrepository/480x270/0c10/480d250/none/11808/QDBQ/sir-shakib-rumah-prihatin-ppv-sop_1835725_20210812170139.png", "text": "On August 11, Sir Shakib posted a series of Instagram Stories to express his anger and disappointment about the lack of management at the Grand Season Hotel (now known as Rumah Prihatin) PPV.\n\nWhen he arrived at the scene, he saw many people queuing so close to each other until they were all almost hugging.

earnings in the second half of the financial year 2021 (2H21), underpinned by higher exports volume and refining margins.\n\nCGS-CIMB Securities Sdn Bhd analysts Nagulan Ravi and Ivy Ng Lee Fang, in a research report, stated that MSM have rightly hedged 99% of its financial year 2021 forecast (FY21F) domestic wholesale raw sugar requirement at US$0.13 (RM0.55) to US$0.14 per pounds (lbs) and 43% of its FY22F requirement at US$0.15-0.16/lbs.\n\nLast year\u2019s raw sugar price averaged at US$0.13-0.14/lbs.\n\n\u201cThis bodes well for MSM given raw sugar prices have been trending higher over the past 18 months to US$0.185/lbs currently, due to supply disruptions in Brazil and Thailand,\u201d the analysts stated in the report yesterday, following a recent update from the company\u2019s management.\n\nThe analysts stated that MSM expects a 10% year-on-year (YoY) growth in its domestic sales volumes in FY21F and has raised its average selling prices (ASPs) for both the wholesale (up to the maximum ceiling price of RM2.69 per kg) and industry segments.\n\nThe higher ASPs and sales volumes would help boost MSM\u2019s domestic refining margins in 2H21F, they added.\n\nRavi and Ng further stated that MSM had secured export contracts worth 65% to 70% of its original 300,000MT export sales target for FY21F.\n\n\u201cThe group is now optimistic of delivering close to 350,000MT of export sales in FY21F, in line with our forecast of 340,000MT, which is a 25% YoY growth versus FY20,\u201d Ravi and Ng added.\n\nThey said the higher export volumes would be driven by stronger demand from its largest export destination, Vietnam, which accounts for around 50% of its exports, and other countries that have reopened from Covid-19 restrictions.\n\nIncreased demand for its value-added products such as liquid sugar, fine syrup and premix products could increase volumes.\n\nThe analysts viewed exports growth would lower refining costs at the group\u2019s refinery in Johor.\n\n\u201cPost the optimisation of its Johor refinery, MSM expects to achieve a 50% utilisation factor (UF) for its Johor refinery in 2H21.\n\n\u201cWe project the Johor refinery could return to

integrated nature of the Asean\u2019s supply chain, the impact from Vietnam\u2019s Covid-19 woes which culminated in the extension of lockdown measures under the government\u2019s Directive 16 in various provinces in the south are felt by Malaysian businesses that have a presence there.\n\nThe directive stipulates the closure of non-essential businesses, ban on public gatherings and severely limited transport services, in an attempt to contain the wave of Covid Delta variant infections.\n\nIn the past, Vietnam enjoyed success in containing the pandemic attributed to prompt border closure and lockdown measures, as well as an extensive testing and contact tracing strategy.\n\nVietnam recorded 8,324 new Covid-19 cases on Friday, according to the country\u2019s Ministry of Health. The new infections brought the total tally to 193,381, with 3,016 deaths, the ministry said.\n\nCurrently, 19 southern localities in the country, including Ho Chi Minh City, have implemented a lockdown via Directive 16 until Aug 16. Meanwhile, The lockdown in Hanoi, Vietnam\u2019s capital, has been extended by 15 days until Aug 22.\n\nAs a result, a number of Bursa Malaysia-listed issuers with facilities in Vietnam have reported suspension of operations there.\n\nYBS International Bhd\n\nIts subsidiary, Oriental Fastech Manufacturing (Vietnam), which is involved in high precision metal fabrication and assembly, is partially suspending its operations to comply with the government\u2019s directive.\n\nMagni-Tech Industries Bhd\n\nIts garment production facilities in Vietnam have been suspended in line with the government\u2019s directive. The group is mitigating the impact of the closure via close engagement with its customers to manage the production capacity challenges as well as rescheduling delivery dates to meet customer\u2019s demand. It is assessing the impact of the closure on its financial performance and announcements will be made if there is any material development.\n\nPoh Huat Resources Holdings Bhd\n\nThe group\u2019s subsidiary, Poh Huat Furniture Industries Vietnam Joint Stock Co, which has factories in Binh Duong Province and Dong Nai Province, has halted production activities in line with the lockdown order. As of July 21, it said none of its employees in the two locations has exhibited any Covid-19 symptoms and it will undertake screening and quarantine measures should any employee exhibit symptoms or be confirmed positive of the virus.\n\nConsequently, the production interruption is expected to cause delay in the shipment of orders to its customers in the US. Poh Huat\u2019s management is in discussions with affected customers to reschedule their delivery dates for affected orders. It said it is able to mitigate some of the impact from the closure as it has a certain amount of ready inventory to meet the orders and it will increase production with extended shifts upon resumption of production activities, if necessary.\n\nLatitude Tree Holdings Bhd\n\nTwo of the group\u2019s subsidiaries, Latitude Tree Vietnam Joint Stock Co and RK Resources Co Ltd, are partially suspending operations to comply with Vietnam\u2019s Directive 16.

These criteria must be publicised so that any future decisions will be solely based on evidence,\u201d MHC explained.\n\nAdditionally, the coalition said the government should clarify the specifics of these relaxed restrictions, because blanket vaccine privileges will create loopholes that will impede NRP.\n\n\u201cFor example, the government must answer questions like: What is the rationale to allow home quarantine for vaccinated travellers, how long is the quarantine and how will we monitor? How do we close the loopholes that may allow \u2018inter-state vacations on the pretext of visiting our children?\u2019\u201d it said.\n\nMeanwhile, Malaysian Medical Association (MMA) president Datuk Dr Subramaniam Muniandy said the decision to relax restrictions must be supported with sufficient scientific evidence.\n\n\u201cIf it is indeed a decision based on science, why then is travel allowed for those wishing to see their spouse or their young children? Either it\u2019s sufficiently safe for the fully vaccinated to travel, in which case all vaccinated individuals should be allowed to do so, or it is not, in which nobody should travel,\u201d he said.\n\nHe noted that some of those states in Phase 2 are showing an increasing trend in Covid-19 cases.\n\n\u201cThe government should stop its hyping up on the total number of cases. What is important are hospital bed utilisation and the intensive care units (ICUs) situation in the country,\u201d Dr Subramaniam said.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, we hope that the government will provide an update on the positivity rate and the status of bed utilisation and ICUs in each state as these will be more meaningful indicators apart from the daily new cases. It is important that the public be kept informed of the bed capacity and ICUs status in their respective state,\u201d he added.\n\nMMA also said that the lifting of restrictions must also take into

coffee as part of your beauty routine?\n\nIt seems that many people have, judging from the numerous recipes of homemade cosmetics featuring the ingredient that can be found on social networks, notably TikTok.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not really a surprise because coffee \u2013 whether as an active ingredient (caffeine) or in its different textures (coffee grounds or powder) \u2013 has countless virtues for skin and hair.\n\nETX Daily Up is focussing on a few that should help convince you to either concoct your own treatments, or embrace some of the numerous cosmetic formulations based on this precious ingredient.\n\nCaffeine, an active ingredient that shouldn\u2019t be ignored\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon to find cosmetics formulated with caffeine, an active ingredient known for its slimming and firming benefits.\n\nGenerally, it is found in creams, gels, and other beauty products designed to help lose a few centimetres on the hips, thighs, or buttocks, as well as in anti-cellulite products or formulations designed to help users improve toning or firmness.\n\nBut caffeine is also present in certain facial care products, again with the aim of fighting skin slackening, but also \u2013 and above all \u2013 to improve the appearance of the eye contour area and reduce puffiness and dark circles (it can be even more effective if the product has spent some time in the refrigerator).\n\nCreams, gels, masks, cleansers: caffeine is nowadays found in products at all price points in the cosmetic departments of department stores and specialised shops.\n\nIn the form of powder and grounds\n\nWith the advent of DIY beauty, coffee now shows up in many so-called \u201chomemade\u201d recipes in the form of powder or grounds.\n\nRich in caffeine, these formulations can offer the advantages mentioned above, but are also powerful antioxidants, which allows them to fight against certain effects seen on mature skins, and more generally against skin aging.\n\nIn addition

collaborating with GE Digital on aircraft fuel efficiency monitoring solutions as part of the carrier\u2019s initiatives to meet its sustainability goals.\n\nThe national flag carrier adopted GE Digital\u2019s Fuel Insight and FlightPulse aviation software to transform and modernise the airline\u2019s fuel efficiency programme.\n\nMAB has implemented various initiatives including efficiency measures, investments in sustainability solutions and waste reduction across its operations to address its sustainability goals.\n\nThe fuel efficiency programme has been running for over a decade, contributing to a 15% fuel burn improvement recorded over the past eight years.\n\nMAB\u2019s group operations officer, Ahmad Luqman Mohd Azmi, stated promoting sustainability in all of the MAB\u2019s operations has always been a top priority.\n\nHe said digitalisation is a core component of the airlines\u2019 long term business plan and such efforts bring immediate value especially in the area of fuel efficiency.\n\n\u201cWe are looking forward to such a partnership that contributes to the airline\u2019s efforts to accelerate our sustainability target.\n\n\u201cThrough these solutions, we seek to play a greater part in building a legacy for future generations and enhancing our own airline\u2019s sustainability efforts,\u201d Ahmad Luqman said in a statement yesterday.\n\nFuel Insight is a cost and emissions monitoring solution that works by understanding data from the aircraft to uncover valuable intelligence that helps increase fuel efficiency and reduce waste.\n\nIt also gives operators actionable intelligence at multiple levels allowing analysts to drill down macro trends to understand issues on a per-flight level.\n\nThe software uses GE Digital\u2019s Event Measurement System (EMS) aviation data and analytics platform to merge flight data with flight plans, load sheets and fuel uplift data, identify the most attainable fuel savings opportunities, and track the incremental savings across the operation.\n\nFlightPulse, meanwhile, puts data directly into the hands of pilots, allowing them to visualise their savings over time.\n\nPilots who understand their own performance can adjust their flight plans to maximise safety and fuel efficiency.\n\nSecure benchmarking and data sharing allows crew members to see their contribution to projects and dramatically shortens the feedback loop.\n\nMAB evaluated the software with an extensive team of pilots, dispatchers and analysts who endorsed the software solution, which is hosted on GE Digital\u2019s EMS

But fans in Malaysia have something to look forward to as two locals are working on a real-life version of the game \u2013 and this time, you can finally taste your veggies.\n\nWith the help of artificial intelligence and, in the near future, drones, Aquaville Asia hopes to become the world\u2019s first aquaponics farm where subscribers can nurture actual crops through their phones.\n\nFeeling like kale this week but kangkung the next? No problem, just tap on your screen and come harvest day, you will be greeted at your doorstep with fresh greens harvested from your own aquaponic plot.\n\nThat\u2019s the plan, at least \u2013 but for the time being, the concept is already in motion where subscribers can get five packs of vegetables delivered four times a month, with optional tilapia fish.\n\nAquaville founder Chia Weng Yan tells FMT that the idea came to him in the middle of the night. \u201cI dreamt about it and jotted down \u2018FarmVille in real life\u2019,\u201d the 40-year-old says.\n\n\u201cI created a pitch deck for it thinking it was a great idea, but didn\u2019t execute it and kept it on my computer for a long time,\u201d he adds, explaining that he struggled to find someone with the technological know-how to make his literal dream a reality.\n\nThen, in July last year, Chia found the perfect person for the job.\n\nLoke Chung Eng had posted on Facebook about robotics and projects involving IOT, or \u201cinternet of things\u201d, a network of physical objects embedded with sensors, software and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data.\n\nA phone call later and Chia had joined forces with Loke, 33, to create Aquaville Asia. The duo worked for months on the concept.\n\nWhile Loke spent time programming the AI system, Chia reached out to urban farmers, friends and family members to get them on board.\n\nThe duo forged an alliance with AHA Services Malaysia, a farm run by urban agriculturalists who provide Aquaville with all their farming requirements, including maintenance, harvest and delivery of fresh produce to subscribers.\n\nChia and Loke leave the farming to these experts and do their share by equipping the farm with Aquaville\u2019s AI technology.\n\n\u201cWe provide them with smart-farm capabilities so if any subscriptions come in, they are ready to harvest and deliver the produce,\u201d Chia explains.\n\nHe adds that using AI, Loke created a way to spot diseases in crops using an NDVI camera that scans vegetables at different wavelengths \u201cso you know if they are dying ahead of time\u201d.\n\nThe AI system can even monitor pH levels, humidity, heat and water levels. All their crops are pesticide-free.\n\nAquaville was officially launched in January this year, and subscribers have been effusive about how lush and crisp their vegetables are, compared with those bought in a store.\n\nSome customers have also funnelled their harvests to the needy, among them three companies that donated to a special-needs home in Petaling Jaya \u2013 sending bundles of fresh greens to feed 74 children between January and June \u2013 as well as contributed towards the white flag movement.\n\nIn the near future, Chia and Loke aim to introduce an application and drone system that will swoop over crops and capture real-time footage. Subscribers will be able to monitor their greens and control them through the app.\n\nAdditionally, the duo hope to empower the less fortunate and provide deaf, mute and B40 families with job opportunities on the farm.\n\nIt may take a few years for this FarmVille dream to fully become a reality, but the Aquaville innovators are hopeful and looking forward to a bright and greener future.\n\nFor fresh produce at your door each week or to help the needy, contact Aquaville Asia via Facebook or check out their website.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["taste", "malaysias", "veggies", "provide", "ai", "loke", "crops", "system", "chia", "aquaville", "farmville", "subscribers", "fresh", "vegetables"], "summary": "PETALING JAYA: Thousands were left cropless and devastated last year when Zynga\u2019s popular game FarmVille announced the end of its 11-year legacy.\nBut fans in Malaysia have something to look forward to as two locals are working on a real-life version of the game \u2013 and this time, you can finally taste your veggies.\nAquaville founder Chia Weng Yan tells FMT that the idea came to him in the middle of the night.\nWhile Loke spent time programming the AI system, Chia reached out to urban farmers, friends and family members to get them on board.\nThe AI system can even monitor pH levels, humidity, heat and water levels.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-08-12 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "SKP Resources marked as a safer bet amid the pandemic", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWFsYXlzaWFucmVzZXJ2ZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wOC8wNC9za3AtcmVzb3VyY2VzLW1hcmtlZC1hcy1hLXNhZmVyLWJldC1hbWlkLXRoZS1wYW5kZW1pYy_SAWVodHRwczovL3RoZW1hbGF5c2lhbnJlc2VydmUuY29tLzIwMjEvMDgvMDQvc2twLXJlc291cmNlcy1tYXJrZWQtYXMtYS1zYWZlci1iZXQtYW1pZC10aGUtcGFuZGVtaWMvYW1wLw?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://themalaysianreserve.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/04TR011A2-1.jpg", "text": "The steady global demand cost pass-through mechanism helps to mitigate any rise in production costs for the company, analyst says\n\nby NUR HAZIQAH A MALEK / Pic credit: skpres.com\n\nSKP Resources Bhd, which is involved in the electronic manufacturing services (EMS), is seen as one of the more resilient companies in a robust industry with upside in capacity despite the current impact of the Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns.\n\nRHB Investment Bank Bhd analyst Soong Wei Siang noted that the steady global demand cost pass-through mechanism should mitigate any rise in production costs, making SKP one of the safer buys for investors.\n\nHe added that the company\u2019s upcoming results for the first quarter of 2022 (1Q22) will meet estimates and reflect healthy topline growth.\n\n\u201cThese factors, together with new production lines secured earlier, should propel the company\u2019s three-year net profit compound annual growth rate to 13%,\u201d he wrote in a note yesterday.\n\nSKP is scheduled to release its results on Aug 30, and expectations include both quarterly sales and profit to improve significantly year-on-year (YoY) from the low base in 1Q21 that was affected by the first Movement Control Order.\n\n\u201cOn a quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) basis, 1Q22 sales should normalise from the seasonally weaker 4Q21, but bottom-line growth could be flattish as 4Q21 earnings incorporated some one-off margin boosters and relatively low effective tax rates.\n\n\u201cWe maintain our earnings forecasts, but raise our target price to RM2.05 after rolling over the valuation base year to 2022, from the\n\nFY22 while the ascribed price-to-earnings ratio is unchanged, at 19 times,\u201d he said.\n\nSeasonally, EMS players tend to enjoy increased order volumes during the second half of the calendar year due to year-end festive demand across key markets.\n\n\u201cWe understand there is no exception this year, based on the flow of orders the company has received.\n\n\u201cHowever, the EMS players including SKP may not be able to reap the full benefits this round \u2014 especially if lockdown restrictions are to be further extended,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that to minimise the earnings downside, the research house believes SKP would be focused on making the best out of its restricted workforce capacity, managing supply chain disruptions and protecting its workers from pandemic-related risks via the tight implementation of standard operating procedures and vaccinations.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding the near-term challenges, we believe SKP\u2019s growth prospects and outlook remain promising.\n\n\u201cApart from the abovementioned robust order flow for existing products, SKP is also scheduled to commence another two new production lines by end-2021 and 1Q22,\u201d he said.\n\nThe research house believes both lines will be housed in the newly leased plant and SKP is embarking on another major expansion which could start in 4Q21.\n\n\u201cThis could potentially lift its total capacity by 40% once completed.

Unscrupulous factories dump toxic waste into rivers, killing entire ecosystems. During our hot and dry seasons (like now!), some areas of the country even face drought!\n\nEven worse? These incidents happen frequently.\n\nWater is the building block of life, which is why clean water is so important to us. While Malaysia enjoys relatively heavy rainfall due to our geographic location and abundant rainforests, we often take water for granted.\n\nDon\u2019t let your water consumption run out of control; turn off your tap when not in use!\n\n(Credit: Envato)\n\nAccording to our National Water Services Commission (SPAN), Malaysians use an average of 201 liters of water per person per day! For an average household of 4, that\u2019s around 800 liters every single day!\n\nBut that\u2019s just the people. What about our economy?\n\nActually, all manufacturing requires an intensive amount of water just to process materials and create an end product. For example, it takes about 1,890 liters of water to make a pair of jeans, and 500 liters of water to make a 2-liter bottle of soda. The cost of buying something is often more than its price, especially when you account for the water used in making the product. There is an environmental impact besides the sticker price you pay.\n\nBeer is 90-95% water, after all.\n\n(Credit: Freepik)\n\nStill, it may come as a surprise to the general public to learn that brewers really, really care about water protection, from its source to its use, and take the greatest amount of care to treat water right.\n\nAfter all, a key ingredient in all beers is water. Without water, it would be impossible to brew beer.\n\nThat\u2019s why one of the largest brewers in Malaysia, Heineken, has been strongly gunning for key sustainability efforts and has consistently reduced water used in brewing their beer while leading the agenda on water stewardship\u2013 protecting water resources with a triangular approach.\n\nHeineken uses Every Drop strategy, a triangular approach to ensure the best watershed health.\n\n(Credit: Heineken)\n\nFirstly, they ensure water efficiency. By making sure each liter of water is used efficiently with no waste, less water will be required to use in total.\n\nSecondly, they maximize water circularity. They aim to maximise water circularity in water-stressed areas to have 100% of their wastewater worldwide treated in an appropriate manner.\n\nThirdly, they maintain water stewardship. Which is to say, they are taking responsibility of the water used in a collaborative effort.\n\nIn fact, Heineken Malaysia is expected to publish their water stewardship achievements over the next week, which would allow the public to judge for themselves the true benefits of such an implementation.\n\nWe\u2019re looking forward to see how such a large brewer, producing our favourite brands including Heineken, Tiger, Guinness, Anchor, and Apple Fox is taking steps to ensure sustainability and accountability in its efforts to protect the long-term of sustainability of water supply.\n\n(Credit: Heineken)\n\nShare your thoughts with us via TRP\u2019s Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.", "keyword": ["water", "liters", "used", "ensure", "clean", "triangular", "stewardship", "left", "change", "sustainability", "heineken", "waste", "thats"], "summary": "Its citizens, especially those living in the Klang Valley, often face water cuts when water sources get polluted.\nWater is the building block of life, which is why clean water is so important to us.\nThe cost of buying something is often more than its price, especially when you account for the water used in making the product.\nBy making sure each liter of water is used efficiently with no waste, less water will be required to use in total.\nWhich is to say, they are taking responsibility of the water used in a collaborative effort.", "news": "The Rakyat Post", "date": "2021-08-04 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Ethiopia\u2019s Selemon Barega wins men\u2019s Olympic 10,000m", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9zcG9ydHMvMjAyMS8wNy8zMC9ldGhpb3BpYXMtc2VsZW1vbi1iYXJlZ2Etd2lucy1tZW5zLW9seW1waWMtMTAwMDBtL9IBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/barega-300721-ap.jpg", "text": "TOKYO: Ethiopia\u2019s Selemon Barega outsprinted Ugandan pre-race favourite Joshua Cheptegei to claim the men\u2019s Olympic 10,000m gold today.\n\nCommonwealth champion Cheptegei, who finished sixth in the event in Rio before winning world silver in 2017 and gold in 2019, had set world records over the 5,000 and 10,000m on road and track in 2020.\n\nBut there was to be no gold in Tokyo as Barega, 21, timed his last-lap sprint to perfection to win the first athletics gold of the Games in 27:43.22s.\n\nCheptegei claimed silver in 27:43.63s with teammate Jacob Kiplimo taking bronze in 27:43.88s.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["mens", "cheptegei", "gold", "selemon", "barega", "winning", "10000m", "win", "olympic", "world", "ugandan", "wins", "ethiopias", "silver", "tokyo"], "summary": "TOKYO: Ethiopia\u2019s Selemon Barega outsprinted Ugandan pre-race favourite Joshua Cheptegei to claim the men\u2019s Olympic 10,000m gold today.\nCommonwealth champion Cheptegei, who finished sixth in the event in Rio before winning world silver in 2017 and gold in 2019, had set world records over the 5,000 and 10,000m on road and track in 2020.\nBut there was to be no gold in Tokyo as Barega, 21, timed his last-lap sprint to perfection to win the first athletics gold of the Games in 27:43.22s.\nCheptegei claimed silver in 27:43.63s with teammate Jacob Kiplimo taking bronze in 27:43.88s.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-07-30 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "KJ Doesn\u2019t Really Trust Zahid Following The Latter\u2019s Political Blunders", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wOC8wOS9rai1kb2VzbnQtcmVhbGx5LXRydXN0LXphaGlkLWZvbGxvd2luZy10aGUtbGF0dGVycy1wb2xpdGljYWwtYmx1bmRlcnMv0gGBAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wOC8wOS9rai1kb2VzbnQtcmVhbGx5LXRydXN0LXphaGlkLWZvbGxvd2luZy10aGUtbGF0dGVycy1wb2xpdGljYWwtYmx1bmRlcnMvYW1wLw?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Hakim Hassan", "Maya Suraya", "Azizul Rahman Ismail"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Untitled-33.jpg", "text": "Subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates.\n\nScience, Innovation and Technology Minister Khairy Jamaluddin has admitted to the media that he doesn\u2019t really trust UMNO President Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi who was allegedly involved in a couple of controversies.\n\nIt was reported by MalaysiaKini that incidents such as the letter to the Yang di-Pertuan Agong and the leaked audio recording the UMNO President and PKR President Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim has made it difficult for the Khairy to trust Ahmad Zahid.\n\nFor now, he said that he will continue doing his job to vaccinate Malaysians via the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme.\n\nI am still loyal to Umno.

This is the most likely scenario,\u201d said Le Parisien this morning.\n\n\u201cIt only seems to be a matter of hours,\u201d suggested sports daily L\u2019Equipe, which proclaimed \u201cwe are entering the most incredible days in the history of the French championship\u201d.\n\nBefore signing the contract in Paris, Messi will first have to undergo a medical examination.\n\nStressing no deals had been done, Messi conceded at his tearful farewell news conference in Barcelona yesterday that joining PSG was a \u201cpossibility\u201d.\n\nIn reality, they are the only club who can afford what is expected to be a deal worth \u20ac35 million a year for the 34-year-old Argentine.\n\n\u201cI gave everything for Barcelona from the first day that I arrived right to the last.

year\u2019s Merdeka will be like no other, courtesy of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nWith most of the Klang Valley and other urban centres under strict lockdown, the usual display of patriotic sentiments will be somewhat drowned out by the pervasive gloom of the moment.\n\nYet, 27 artists have chosen to express their love for the country during the month of Merdeka by displaying their works in an online exhibition titled very simply \u201cJalur Gemilang\u201d.\n\nOpen for viewing until the end of the month, the exhibition is hosted by Artas Galeri, an art gallery based in Petaling Jaya.\n\nAccording to Roy Ng, Artas Galeri\u2019s director, plans were already underway to hold a physical Merdeka-themed exhibition in the months leading up to August.\n\nHowever, with the extension of MCO 3.0, it became painfully clear that Plan B would have to be executed.\n\n\u201cDue to the pandemic and the increasing number of cases, I decided to launch an online show with an e-catalogue instead,\u201d he said.\n\nThat way, art enthusiasts will still be able to view the art pieces themselves without leaving the safety of their homes.\n\n\u201cMost of these artists\u2019 works exhibited in the \u2018Jalur Gemilang\u2019 exhibition are based on our national flag\u2019s colours,\u201d Ng said, adding that a majority of them used copious amounts of red, yellow, blue and white in multiple art styles including abstract, still-life and figurative.\n\nAccording to him, the artists are a fascinating group made up of graduates fresh out of art school as well as senior artists who have made a name for themselves in the art world.\n\nFMT had the pleasure of interviewing six of the artists regarding their hopes for the country this Merdeka month.\n\nYuki Lim Xiao Mun, artist of the almost ethereal \u201cThe Paradise Land\u201d, had this to say: \u201cMy hope for this Merdeka month is that our country can be restored to good condition after the economic hardship caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nShe said it was also her sincere hope that Malaysia\u2019s leaders will lead the country down the right path by practising integrity in their leadership.\n\nLikewise, Fadzril Fakaruddin encouraged Malaysians to stay united no matter what the circumstances, so that together, they could be free of Covid-19 for good.\n\nWhile Hamir Soib hopes for better governance, fellow artist Najib Ahmad Bamadhaj is hopeful for a return to normalcy and the good \u2018ol pre-Covid days.\n\nNational unity is something that veteran artist, Awang Damit, believes is vital if the country is to survive these difficult times.\n\nAnd another artist, Zulkefli Talha, reminded Malaysians to love each other as fellow countrymen regardless of racial or religious differences.\n\n\u201cLeaders have to be good examples for the people. And both leaders and the people have to work together to end this pandemic and return Malaysia to its former glory.\u201d\n\nNg told FMT that the pandemic had been especially tough on many artists. The numerous lockdowns this past year and a half meant potential buyers were unable to view the artworks personally and as a consequence, there was little to no sales.\n\nHe said there was an urgent need for artists to find alternative avenues to display their work so that they could continue to earn a decent living.\n\nNg explained that things have not been looking up for artists for a while now. Prior to the pandemic, the sluggish economy meant artists struggled to make a sale. The lockdowns brought about by the pandemic, only made things worse.\n\n\u201cMost collectors and buyers prefer to see the pieces in person. There\u2019s a huge difference between seeing artworks personally and virtually,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen you view an artwork physically, you will be able to see the texture, notice the colour tones and spot the little details. That\u2019s something these virtual exhibitions sadly cannot offer.\u201d\n\nHowever, this has not dampened the spirit of art collectors such as Brendan Siva in regard to the \u201cJalur Gemilang\u201d exhibition.\n\n\u201cEach piece is unique as an individual interpretation and expression of what Malaysia represents and symbolises in the eyes of the artist. It reflects the rich cultural and social fabric of Malaysia and its people.\u201d\n\nAnother art collector, Bingley Sim added, \u201cThe different styles and approaches in the use of the red, blue, yellow and white colours in the artworks reflect the exuberant spirit of Malaysia.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe works in the \u2018Jalur Gemilang\u2019 exhibition this year are all about resilience, tenacity and hope,\u201d said fellow art collector Cheow Wee.\n\n\u201cArt is a topic that brings people together no matter what ethnicity or religious belief one belongs to.\u201d\n\nHe added that since artists too are experiencing a bad year, it is important for other Malaysians to step up and support them.\n\n\u201cWe want to urge local artists never to give up as many of us will support them in our own little ways. After all, Kita Jaga Kita.\u201d\n\nTo find out more about Artas Galeri, visit them on Instagram, Facebook or WhatsApp 010-9009363 for an e-catalogue.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["exhibition", "art", "local", "pandemic", "month", "works", "merdeka", "view", "artists", "mark", "country", "online", "artist"], "summary": "PETALING JAYA: There\u2019s no question that this year\u2019s Merdeka will be like no other, courtesy of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nYet, 27 artists have chosen to express their love for the country during the month of Merdeka by displaying their works in an online exhibition titled very simply \u201cJalur Gemilang\u201d.\nOpen for viewing until the end of the month, the exhibition is hosted by Artas Galeri, an art gallery based in Petaling Jaya.\nFMT had the pleasure of interviewing six of the artists regarding their hopes for the country this Merdeka month.\n\u201cWe want to urge local artists never to give up as many of us will support them in our own little ways.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-08-13 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "US smash world record in men\u2019s 4x100m medley relay", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9zcG9ydHMvMjAyMS8wOC8wMS91cy1zbWFzaC13b3JsZC1yZWNvcmQtaW4tbWVucy00eDEwMG0tbWVkbGV5LXJlbGF5L9IBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/us-relay-4x100-010821-ap.jpg", "text": "TOKYO: A storming butterfly leg from Caeleb Dressel powered the US to a new world record and the gold medal in the men\u2019s Olympic 4x100m medley relay final today.\n\nThe US team of Ryan Murphy, Michael Andrew, Dressel and Zach Apple touched in 3:26.78s to smash the global 3:27.28s mark set at the 2009 World Championships.\n\nBritain came second in 3:27.51s and Italy were third in 3:29.17s.\n\nThe Americans were trailing at 200m after Andrew\u2019s breaststroke leg against Britain\u2019s Adam Peaty but when Dressel hit the water that all changed.\n\nHe clawed back the lead, leaving Apple to finish the job.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["mens", "water", "4x100m", "leg", "medley", "trailing", "touched", "dressel", "record", "world", "zach", "apple", "todaythe", "smash", "relay", "tokyo"], "summary": "TOKYO: A storming butterfly leg from Caeleb Dressel powered the US to a new world record and the gold medal in the men\u2019s Olympic 4x100m medley relay final today.\nThe US team of Ryan Murphy, Michael Andrew, Dressel and Zach Apple touched in 3:26.78s to smash the global 3:27.28s mark set at the 2009 World Championships.\nBritain came second in 3:27.51s and Italy were third in 3:29.17s.\nThe Americans were trailing at 200m after Andrew\u2019s breaststroke leg against Britain\u2019s Adam Peaty but when Dressel hit the water that all changed.\nHe clawed back the lead, leaving Apple to finish the job.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-08-01 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Meet Ita O\u2019Brian: in-demand intimacy coordinator", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9sZWlzdXJlL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvMjAyMS8wNy8zMC9tZWV0LWl0YS1vYnJpYW4taW4tZGVtYW5kLWludGltYWN5LWNvb3JkaW5hdG9yL9IBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ita-lifestyle.jpg", "text": "LONDON: Britain\u2019s Ita O\u2019Brien is one of entertainment\u2019s unsung stars, ensuring actors are comfortable filming their most sensitive scenes in a job she has made her own.\n\nThe 56-year-old intimacy coordinator has been a key figure behind sex scenes in acclaimed television series such as \u201cI May Destroy You\u201d, \u201cSex Education\u201d and \u201cNormal People\u201d.\n\nPreserving the intimacy of an artist filming a rape depiction, setting up a sex scene with a virgin actor, and identifying the limits each actor is comfortable with are all issues O\u2019Brien is regularly confronted with.\n\nA typical conversation she regularly has with stars, she says, goes along the lines of: \u201cHe is going to put his hand here, you put yours there and then you start the fellatio.\u201d\n\nShe sees her role as one of ensuring \u201copen communication\u201d between the director and the actors on all intimate scenes that may include kissing, nudity or sex.\n\n\u201cThis is a process by which we bring our professional structure to intimacy\u201d, allowing the on-screen stars to \u201cbring all of the skills of the actor to this moment,\u201d she adds.\n\n\u201cWe agree on a consent of touch and then a clear process by which we choreograph the intimate contact clearly. So it\u2019s just like dance.\u201d\n\nEach scene will be discussed and rehearsed beforehand, away from the glare of the dozens of people usually present on a set.\n\n\u201cWhen the camera rolls or they\u2019re up on stage, they know they can perform that intimate contact, knowing where they\u2019re going to be touched,\u201d she says.\n\nAt the heart of her philosophy is consent, in an industry which has been rocked in recent years by sexual assault claims. Her motto, which she says she often repeats to actors, is: \u201cYour \u2018no\u2019 is a gift. Tell us your \u2018no\u2019, so that we can trust your \u2018yes'\u201d.\n\n\u2018Incredibly hard\u2019\n\nO\u2019Brien was a dancer in the theatre for 10 years and then an actress for eight before she sensed an opportunity and became an intimacy coordinator in 2014.\n\nIt was a pioneering move at a time when actors\u2019 consent was little talked about, and before the #MeToo movement against sexual abuse and sexual harassment.\n\nBefore then, \u201cif an actor ever said \u2018no\u2019, they\u2019d be a troublemaker or a diva, and they would certainly be worried about losing their job,\u201d she recalls.\n\nIn such an environment, she describes her early days in the role as \u201cincredibly hard\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had productions where I\u2019ve been told not to speak to the director,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m serving the director\u2019s vision, but the director doesn\u2019t want to speak to me because he\u2019s a 74-year-old man, who basically doesn\u2019t want to acknowledge my existence.\u201d\n\nOn other occasions, she was not allowed on the set because the actors or director did not want her help.\n\nAttitudes have since changed a lot. The profession is becoming more popular and O\u2019Brien is in high demand, especially after Michaela Coel dedicated her best actress BAFTA win this year for \u201cI May Destroy You\u201d to her.\n\n\u201cThank you, Ita, for making a space safe, for creating physical, emotional and professional boundaries, so we can make work about exploitation, loss of respect, about abuse of powers, without being exploited or abused in the process,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["stars", "sexual", "ita", "obrien", "indemand", "intimacy", "process", "coordinator", "scenes", "sex", "actor", "obrian", "meet", "actors", "director"], "summary": "LONDON: Britain\u2019s Ita O\u2019Brien is one of entertainment\u2019s unsung stars, ensuring actors are comfortable filming their most sensitive scenes in a job she has made her own.\nThe 56-year-old intimacy coordinator has been a key figure behind sex scenes in acclaimed television series such as \u201cI May Destroy You\u201d, \u201cSex Education\u201d and \u201cNormal People\u201d.\n\u201cThis is a process by which we bring our professional structure to intimacy\u201d, allowing the on-screen stars to \u201cbring all of the skills of the actor to this moment,\u201d she adds.\n\u201cWe agree on a consent of touch and then a clear process by which we choreograph the intimate contact clearly.\n\u2018Incredibly hard\u2019O\u2019Brien was a dancer in the theatre for 10 years and then an actress for eight before she sensed an opportunity and became an intimacy coordinator in 2014.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-07-30 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}]
