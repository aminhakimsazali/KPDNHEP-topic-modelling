The pilot programme will begin on July 26 at the industry vaccination centre (PPVIN) at Cititel Mid Valley City, Kuala Lumpur,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nAccording to Nanta Linggi, RiVAC will target the economic frontline workers of the retail sector such as cashiers, salesmen, restaurant crews, gas station workers, supermarket crews, departmental store crews, barbers and beauticians, shopping complex management and distribution chain employees.\n\nHe noted that this is to ensure that the retail sector can provide a safe and convincing shopping experience to the consumers.\n\nNanta

around Kuala Lumpur.\n\nHe added that it is an initiative between KPDNHEP and the retail industry players including the Malaysia Shopping Malls Association (PPK), fully supported by the Covid-19 Immunisation Special Task Force (CITF).\n\n\u201cCompanies and employers participating in RiVAC will be subject to the terms and conditions for the implementation of vaccination programmes through

immunisation programme, especially as the workers are exposed to infections as they have to interact with consumers daily.\n\nHe added that the retail sector, being an essential service, operates throughout Phase 1 of the NRP to ensure the public have continuous access to daily needs without having to panic buy.\n\n\u201cThe ministry is confident that by accelerating vaccination for industry

shopping malls hosting the industrial vaccination centres (PPVIN), particularly for retail workers under the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP).\n\nHowever, KPDNHEP last month announced that shopping malls\u2019 vaccination programmes would be postponed from July to August.\n\nPPK mentioned that more than 60 malls have offered to host PPVs and have agreed to deeply

There was hope that this all was going to be over soon.\n\nAs time went by, the rippling effect from the ban grew and that hope began to diminish. As restaurants and kitchens close or shut down, the economic ecosystem surrounding them feel the effect, and people begin to lose their income and their jobs.\n\nFrom the outside looking in, we see that some eateries pivot their businesses towards delivery. However, most food and beverage establishments in Malaysia are not built to fit the delivery model.\n\nEateries such as casual and fine dining restaurants depend on their ambience in addition to their menu. Additionally, not all foods and beverages such as soups and alcoholic drinks are favourable through delivery, and delivery services are costly which eats into the slim profit margins of these businesses and puts them in the red.\n\nThe united F&B joint statement\n\nZakaria Zayane / Unsplash\n\nBecause of the dire situation affecting F&B businesses and their supply chains, a coalition of five F&B associations held a press conference and released a joint statement addressing the matter.\n\nThey urge the Ministry of Health (MOH), National Security Council (MKN), Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP), and any related ministry to engage, discuss and debate with stakeholders (trade associations) for a solution.\n\nThe coalition believes by engaging with them, they could provide a wider perspective that could result in better policies and SOPs.\n\nWe are not asking for handouts, instead we need the government to be reasonable. The F&B industry has been a significantly small contributor to new clusters because many businesses have been compliant We appeal to Putrajaya, let our people come back to work, save small businesses and let us contribute to the nation again\n\nThe coalition is even prepared to help the government to deal with errant operators if their sector is allowed to reopen for dine-ins again.\n\nThe situation\n\nBased on a 2016 census done by The Department of Statistics, the coalition estimated that the move to not allow dine-ins has affected approximately 1 million Malaysians since 2020. This number does not include the farmers, fisheries, suppliers, distributors, and other businesses that depend on restaurants.\n\nThey said that many F&B operators have less than 2 months of cash flow left and are anticipating at least a 60% closure rate if the ban continues.\n\nAn intervention\n\nRowan Freeman / Unsplash\n\nThe coalition also urged the government to scrap the Essential and Non-Essential industry labels as a first step to finding a better solution.\n\nThey also ask that the government engage, and regulate the 2 largest food delivery platforms, as long as dining-in is not allowed.\n\nThe coalition requests a rebate of 15% on the food delivery commission rates from now till Jan 2022.\n\nThe reduction in commission rates can be made up from the influx of users and orders. At the same time, ensure the welfare of the riders is guarded.

As a result, many will not go the extra mile for patients because they are not motivated.\u201d\n\nThe specialist said there are many brilliant young doctors working with him but they do not know where they will be when their contracts expire.\n\nHe urged the government to quickly address the issue to ensure that the public health service can continue to provide the best care possible.", "keyword": ["specialist", "permanent", "mma", "positions", "opportunity", "doctor", "contract", "healthcare", "denies", "temporary", "specialists", "appointment", "doctors", "service", "public"], "summary": "The only way young doctors can achieve their goal of becoming specialists is to serve in public hospitals.\nHowever, if they are denied permanent positions, they lose that opportunity.\nThe doctor said there are now about 4,600 specialists in various disciplines serving in the public healthcare system.\nHe said if the government does not give existing contract doctors permanent positions, there will eventually be a shortage of specialists.\n\u201cI understand the frustrations many contract doctors are experiencing, because they do not know what their future holds.", "news": "The Sun Daily", "date": "2021-07-05 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Official MKN SOP For Phase 2 Of NRP As Of 23 July (In English)", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wNy8wNi9vZmZpY2lhbC1ta24tc29wLWZvci1waGFzZS0yLW9mLW5ycC1hcy1vZi01LWp1bHktaW4tZW5nbGlzaC_SAXdodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVyYWt5YXRwb3N0LmNvbS9uZXdzL21hbGF5c2lhLzIwMjEvMDcvMDYvb2ZmaWNpYWwtbWtuLXNvcC1mb3ItcGhhc2UtMi1vZi1ucnAtYXMtb2YtNS1qdWx5LWluLWVuZ2xpc2gvYW1wLw?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Azizul Rahman Ismail", "Maya Suraya"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SOP-Phase-2.jpeg", "text": "Subscribe to our new Telegram channel for the latest updates and stories.\n\nAfter the government announced that the National Recovery Plan (NRP) will be implemented state by state instead of nationwide and that 5 states will go into Phase 2 on July 5, new SOPs were released.\n\nRead More: Five States To Go Into Phase 2 on 5 July\n\nOn 7 July, Penang entered Phase 2.\n\nOn 9 July, Sabah entered Phase 2.\n\nOn 14 July Sarawak entered Phase 2.\n\nFor your convenience, TRP took the liberty of translating the latest Phase 2 standard operating procedures (SOP) released by the National Security Council (MKN) on 23 July.\n\nThe new Phase 2 SOP has some minor changes compared to the one released on 16 July.\n\nThe most notable changes are:\n\n60% of workers may return to the office.\n\nMost businesses may operate from 6 am to 10 pm.\n\nSports and recreational activities are allowed between 6 am and 10 pm.\n\nOutdoor filming is allowed.\n\nAccounting firms are allowed to open.\n\nWe marked all the differences in \u2018orange\u2018.\n\nAreas Involved\n\nKELANTAN, TERENGGANU, PAHANG, PERAK, PERLIS, PENANG, SABAH DAN SARAWAK.\n\n*For areas enforced by RMCO, the RMCO SOP in those areas is in force until the end of the RMCO.\n\nDuration\n\nEffective 5 July 2021 (12.01 am) \u2013 Kelantan, Terengganu, Pahang, Perak and Perlis.\n\nEffective 7 July 2021 (12.01 am) \u2013 Penang.\n\nEffective 9 July 2021 (12.01 am) \u2013 Sabah.

latest stories and updates.\n\nMalaysians have proven time and time again that they are worthy of international success in Cannes.\n\nFor some, making it to the Cannes commune figuratively or literally for a festival, award or even a holiday, is a marker of success for many.\n\nIn light of the recent news of the Cannes Film Festival returning after a year hiatus due to the Covid-19 pandemic, film buffs connoisseurs are anticipating a fresh breath of film talent across the globe.\n\nAlthough no Malaysian titles are showcased at the event this year, the city of Cannes on the French Riviera is still renowned for hosting other significant festivals and award shows like Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, and the Cannes Film Awards to name a couple.\n\nCannes Film Festival\n\nIn essence, the Cannes Film Festival is an annual film festival that previews new films of all genres, including documentaries from all around the world.\n\nAside from its main purpose, it is also a roll call for glitz, glam, networking, and parties.\n\nThat said, only a handful of Malaysians have graced this event and they are:\n\n1995: Film director U-Wei Haji Saari\u2019s film \u201cKaki Bakar\u201d (The Arsonist) was the first Malaysian production to be screened in the Un Certain Regard category. It is a take on William Faulkner\u2019s \u2018Barn Burnin\u2019 about the son of an itinerant worker who tries to prevent his volatile father from deliberately setting fires.\n\n2009: The second Malaysian to have been invited to the prestigious film festival is Chris Chong Chan Fui with his film \u201cKaraoke,\u201d which centres on a villagers way of life and the Malaysian palm oil industry. The film premiered in the Directors\u2019 Fortnight stream that year, an independent selection of the film festival.\n\n2010: Following in Karaoke\u2019s footsteps a year later at the Director\u2019s Fortnight is The Tiger Factory by Woo Ming Jin, a profoundly heartbreaking drama about \u201cbaby factories\u201d.\n\n2014: Malaysian documentary producer Indrani Kopal, a Fulbright scholar at the Hofstra University in New York at the time, was selected for her first production \u201cThe Game Changer\u201d. The documentary about Susan Slotnick, who uses dance as a form for rehabilitation for inmates at the Woodbourne Correctional Facility in New York, was shown at the Cannes Short Film Corner.\n\nCannes Film Awards\n\nMalaysians have also been making waves at the Cannes Film Awards. Not to be confused with the Cannes Film Festival, this international film festival celebrates film, filmmakers, producers, musicians, actors, screenwriters, photographers and the arts in general.\n\nThey aim to bring new names to the film industry and support new creators as well.\n\nRanked among the Top 100 most popular film festivals out of 10,000 festivals worldwide, the festival collaborates with experts in the field of European film art.\n\nIn its inaugural year this year, two Malaysians have each bagged an award at the Cannes Film Awards.\n\n\u201cTouch\u201d by Kurisu Lee, a 13-minute film about a young man and his dreams, won Best Asian Film in the Film Awards \u2013 Continental Category while \u201cGarbageman, Nurse, and Cop\u201d by Aiman Samat won Best Crime Film under the Film Awards \u2013 Additional Category.\n\nThe award show was held at the Cote d\u2019Azur Art Gallery in Cannes, France on 8 June.\n\nCannes Lions International Festival of Creativity\n\nFor the advertising and creative communications industry, winning a Cannes Lions is equivalent to being selected for the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nMalaysian agencies have in the past and are still currently winning large at this event.\n\nVJ Anand, former Executive Creative Director of advertising agency BBDO Malaysia and now Head of Creative of VaynerMedia in Singapore recalls the times Malaysia won big at Cannes Lions.\n\nMalaysia has always been pretty good at winning the global advertising stage and I\u2019m sure Malaysia will keep winning.\n\nHe remembers Southeast Asia\u2019s first and Malaysia\u2019s only Cannes Lions Grand Prix (the awards\u2019 most coveted honour) was in 2004 by JWT Malaysia for \u201cMissile Car\u201d, an imaginative guerrilla outdoor campaign to promote Channel Nine.\n\nSince, other creative agencies that have followed the shiny award trail include the following VJ has noted for us:\n\n2007: \u201cTang Hong Ming\u201d by Leo Burnett/Arc Worldwide Malaysia \u2013 a TV commercial by the acclaimed creative director and filmmaker Yasmin Ahmad. It was the first Malaysian TV commercial that ever won a Gold Cannes Lion and is still probably one of Malaysia\u2019s most memorable ads to date.\n\n2008: BBDO/Proximity Malaysia won Gold Lion for Chrysler Korea\u2019s campaign for Jeep in the Outdoor category.\n\n2015: When VJ was Group Executive Creative Director at TBWA\\Kuala Lumpur, they were awarded the Silver Lion for The Eveready Book of Play which was inspired by the traditional Malaysia form of storytelling, the Wayang Kulit (Shadow Play).\n\nMost recently this year, Grey Malaysia won Silver and Bronze Lion for WWF\u2019s Your Plastic Diet. And in association with the Cannes Lions, they also won the most coveted Grand Prix honour at the WARC Awards for Effectiveness for Tesco: Unforgettable Bag.\n\nThere have been many other Malaysians who have strutted away with a Cannes Lion, and for that we should be proud.\n\nREAD MORE: M\u2019sian filmmaker wins award at Cannes 2019 for incredible anti-bullying PSA", "keyword": ["cannes", "lion", "awards", "award", "international", "malaysians", "celebrating", "creative", "won", "festival", "lions", "malaysian"], "summary": "Malaysians have proven time and time again that they are worthy of international success in Cannes.\nCannes Film FestivalIn essence, the Cannes Film Festival is an annual film festival that previews new films of all genres, including documentaries from all around the world.\nIn its inaugural year this year, two Malaysians have each bagged an award at the Cannes Film Awards.\nCannes Lions International Festival of CreativityFor the advertising and creative communications industry, winning a Cannes Lions is equivalent to being selected for the Cannes Film Festival.\nThere have been many other Malaysians who have strutted away with a Cannes Lion, and for that we should be proud.", "news": "The Rakyat Post", "date": "2021-07-04 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "At least 17 killed in Philippines troop plane crash", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS93b3JsZC8yMDIxLzA3LzA0L2F0LWxlYXN0LTE3LWtpbGxlZC1pbi1waGlsaXBwaW5lcy10cm9vcC1wbGFuZS1jcmFzaC_SAQA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MashaMasha2022_1_800x500.jpg", "text": "MANILA: At least 17 people were killed when a Philippines Air Force plane carrying troops crashed on landing in the south of the country and broke up in flames today.\n\nThe Lockheed C-130 transport aircraft crashed at Patikul in Sulu province, in the far south of the archipelago nation where the army has been fighting a long war against Islamist militants from the Abu Sayyaf and other factions.\n\n\u201cSo far 40 wounded and injured were rescued and 17 bodies recovered.

shopping malls hosting the industrial vaccination centres (PPVIN), particularly for retail workers under the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP).\n\nHowever, KPDNHEP last month

There was hope that this all was going to be over soon.\n\nAs time went by, the rippling effect from the ban grew and that hope began to diminish. As restaurants and kitchens close or shut down, the economic ecosystem surrounding them feel the effect, and people begin to lose their income and their jobs.\n\nFrom the outside looking in, we see that some eateries pivot their businesses towards delivery. However, most food and beverage establishments in Malaysia are not built to fit the delivery model.\n\nEateries such as casual and fine dining restaurants depend on their ambience in addition to their menu. Additionally, not all foods and beverages such as soups and alcoholic drinks are favourable through delivery, and delivery services are costly which eats into the slim profit margins of these businesses and puts them in the red.\n\nThe united F&B joint statement\n\nZakaria Zayane / Unsplash\n\nBecause of the dire situation affecting F&B businesses and their supply chains, a coalition of five F&B associations held a press conference and released a joint statement addressing the matter.\n\nThey urge the Ministry of Health (MOH), National Security Council (MKN), Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP), and any related ministry to engage, discuss and debate with stakeholders (trade associations) for a solution.\n\nThe coalition believes by engaging with them, they could provide a wider perspective that could result in better policies and SOPs.\n\nWe are not asking for handouts, instead we need the government to be reasonable. The F&B industry has been a significantly small contributor to new clusters because many businesses have been compliant We appeal to Putrajaya, let our people come back to work, save small businesses and let us contribute to the nation again\n\nThe coalition is even prepared to help the government to deal with errant operators if their sector is allowed to reopen for dine-ins again.\n\nThe situation\n\nBased on a 2016 census done by The Department of Statistics, the coalition estimated that the move to not allow dine-ins has affected approximately 1 million Malaysians since 2020. This number does not include the farmers, fisheries, suppliers, distributors, and other businesses that depend on restaurants.\n\nThey said that many F&B operators have less than 2 months of cash flow left and are anticipating at least a 60% closure rate if the ban continues.\n\nAn intervention\n\nRowan Freeman / Unsplash\n\nThe coalition also urged the government to scrap the Essential and Non-Essential industry labels as a first step to finding a better solution.\n\nThey also ask that the government engage, and regulate the 2 largest food delivery platforms, as long as dining-in is not allowed.\n\nThe coalition requests a rebate of 15% on the food delivery commission rates from now till Jan 2022.\n\nThe reduction in commission rates can be made up from the influx of users and orders. At the same time, ensure the welfare of the riders is guarded. The review to lower our commission rates should not affect the rider\u2019s abilities to earn a living.\n\nAccording to the coalition, the 2 largest food delivery services charge 30% or more in commissions. This was accepted by most F&B businesses because delivery was seen as marketing and promotion while dine-in and takeaway are the main income.\n\nHowever, when dine-ins are not allowed the 30% commission not only cuts into profit but in a lot of cases make each sale a loss unless prices are increased accordingly.\n\nAt the ready\n\nThe members of the coalition also offer the mobilisation of their social media to help drive vaccination registration numbers, increase vaccine literacy, counter vaccine hesitancy, and reward vaccinated individuals.\n\nIn return, they urge Putrajaya to be transparent and accountable on the expected vaccine arrival timelines so that businesses can plan ahead.\n\nMeanwhile, the coalition of F&B businesses is also being proactive about their situation and is formulating a plan to help both the industry and those in need as well.

This is due to the timeline of the vaccine rollout.\n\n\u201cWhen it is safe to return to the office, I expect more companies will implement a hybrid working model, with staff rotating between WFH and in the office.\n\nTo remain productive during this challenging period, employees would need consistent support from their employers.\n\nIt can be setting up home offices, training leadership to support and manage employees remotely, or implementing technology that effectively digitalises paper-based processes.\n\nThompson also advised employers to consider implementing incentives and programmes to benefit their workers\u2019 wellbeing.\n\n\u201cFor instance, there is the risk of WFH burnout. Employers should encourage their staff to take time off throughout the year by inserting an end-of-year expiry date on leave days to ensure their employees are taking adequate breaks throughout the year,\u201d he suggested.\n\nWellbeing allowances could be used by employees to improve their physical, mental and financial health, including gym memberships, insurance plans or therapy and counselling.\n\nMeanwhile, Linkedin Talent Solutions, Asia Pacific VP Feon Ang said 49% of Malaysians would like to WFH only once or twice a week after the pandemic.\n\n\u201cMoving forward, as we plan to accommodate a hybrid workforce, helping workers stay connected and collaborate must be a priority,\u201d Ang explained.\n\nEmployers can do this through digital tools or encourage regular catch-ups between teams.\n\nAng also explained that another way to prevent employee burnouts as they WFH is to have mandated no-meeting days.", "keyword": ["wfh", "spaces", "work", "office", "employers", "hybrid", "employees", "working", "remote", "companies", "model", "stay", "expect"], "summary": "Hence, remote working should not be seen as a fad but a work culture that produces results and a great way to reduce cost.\n\u201cGoing into a remote or hybrid working model is an opportunity for companies to shift towards a sustainable way of working.\nThompson said some technology start-ups in other countries have permanently given up their office spaces and let their staff work remotely.\nAlternatively, some have also moved to co-working spaces and explored new hybrid working models.\n\u201cWhen it is safe to return to the office, I expect more companies will implement a hybrid working model, with staff rotating between WFH and in the office.", "news": "The Malaysian Reserve", "date": "2021-07-05 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Covid-19: Active cases reached all time high", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWFsYXlzaWFucmVzZXJ2ZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNy8xMi9jb3ZpZC0xOS1uZXctY2FzZXMtZGlwLXRvLTg1NzQv0gFOaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVtYWxheXNpYW5yZXNlcnZlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA3LzEyL2NvdmlkLTE5LW5ldy1jYXNlcy1kaXAtdG8tODU3NC9hbXAv?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://themalaysianreserve.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/08TR002A2-2.jpg", "text": "THE number of active Covid-19 cases in Malaysia has reached record high of 91,272 as 8,574 new cases detected after three days of reporting above 9,000 cases.\n\nThe number of patients currently being treated in the Intensive Care Units (ICU) also increased to record-breaking 964.\n\nA total of 452 patients are requiring respiratory assistance.

literally for a festival, award or even a holiday, is a marker of success for many.\n\nIn light of the recent news of the Cannes Film Festival returning after a year hiatus due to the Covid-19 pandemic, film buffs connoisseurs are anticipating a fresh breath of film talent across the globe.\n\nAlthough no Malaysian titles are showcased at the event this year, the city of Cannes on the French Riviera is still renowned for hosting other significant festivals and award shows like Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, and the Cannes Film Awards to name a couple.\n\nCannes Film Festival\n\nIn essence, the Cannes Film Festival is an annual film festival that previews new films of all genres, including documentaries from all around the world.\n\nAside from its main purpose, it is also a roll call for glitz, glam, networking, and parties.\n\nThat said, only a handful of Malaysians have graced this event and they are:\n\n1995: Film director U-Wei Haji Saari\u2019s film \u201cKaki Bakar\u201d (The Arsonist) was the first Malaysian production to be screened in the Un Certain Regard category. It is a take on William Faulkner\u2019s \u2018Barn Burnin\u2019 about the son of an itinerant worker who tries to prevent his volatile father from deliberately setting fires.\n\n2009: The second Malaysian to have been invited to the prestigious film festival is Chris Chong Chan Fui with his film \u201cKaraoke,\u201d which centres on a villagers way of life and the Malaysian palm oil industry. The film premiered in the Directors\u2019 Fortnight stream that year, an independent selection of the film festival.\n\n2010: Following in Karaoke\u2019s footsteps a year later at the Director\u2019s Fortnight is The Tiger Factory by Woo Ming Jin, a profoundly heartbreaking drama about \u201cbaby factories\u201d.\n\n2014: Malaysian documentary producer Indrani Kopal, a Fulbright scholar at the Hofstra University in New York at the time, was selected for her first production \u201cThe Game Changer\u201d. The documentary about Susan Slotnick, who uses dance as a form for rehabilitation for inmates at the Woodbourne Correctional Facility in New York, was shown at the Cannes Short Film Corner.\n\nCannes Film Awards\n\nMalaysians have also been making waves at the Cannes Film Awards. Not to be confused with the Cannes Film Festival, this international film festival celebrates film, filmmakers, producers, musicians, actors, screenwriters, photographers and the arts in general.\n\nThey aim to bring new names to the film industry and support new creators as well.\n\nRanked among the Top 100 most popular film festivals out of 10,000 festivals worldwide, the festival collaborates with experts in the field of European film art.\n\nIn its inaugural year this year, two Malaysians have each bagged an award at the Cannes Film Awards.\n\n\u201cTouch\u201d by Kurisu Lee, a 13-minute film about a young man and his dreams, won Best Asian Film in the Film Awards \u2013 Continental Category while \u201cGarbageman, Nurse, and Cop\u201d by Aiman Samat won Best Crime Film under the Film Awards \u2013 Additional Category.\n\nThe award show was held at the Cote d\u2019Azur Art Gallery in Cannes, France on 8 June.\n\nCannes Lions International Festival of Creativity\n\nFor the advertising and creative communications industry, winning a Cannes Lions is equivalent to being selected for the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nMalaysian agencies have in the past and are still currently winning large at this event.\n\nVJ Anand, former Executive Creative Director of advertising agency BBDO Malaysia and now Head of Creative of VaynerMedia in Singapore recalls the times Malaysia won big at Cannes Lions.\n\nMalaysia has always been pretty good at winning the global advertising stage and I\u2019m sure Malaysia will keep winning.\n\nHe remembers Southeast Asia\u2019s first and Malaysia\u2019s only Cannes Lions Grand Prix (the awards\u2019 most coveted honour) was in 2004 by JWT Malaysia for \u201cMissile Car\u201d, an imaginative guerrilla outdoor campaign to promote Channel Nine.\n\nSince, other creative agencies that have followed the shiny award trail include the following VJ has noted for us:\n\n2007: \u201cTang Hong Ming\u201d by Leo Burnett/Arc Worldwide Malaysia \u2013 a TV commercial by the acclaimed creative director and filmmaker Yasmin Ahmad. It was the first Malaysian TV commercial that ever won a Gold Cannes Lion and is still probably one of Malaysia\u2019s most memorable ads to date.\n\n2008: BBDO/Proximity Malaysia won Gold Lion for Chrysler Korea\u2019s campaign for Jeep in the Outdoor category.\n\n2015: When VJ was Group Executive Creative Director at TBWA\\Kuala Lumpur, they were awarded the Silver Lion for The Eveready Book of Play which was inspired by the traditional Malaysia form of storytelling, the Wayang Kulit (Shadow Play).\n\nMost recently this year, Grey Malaysia won Silver and Bronze Lion for WWF\u2019s Your Plastic Diet.

There was hope that this all was going to be over soon.\n\nAs time went by, the rippling effect from the ban grew and that hope began to diminish. As restaurants and kitchens close or shut down, the economic ecosystem surrounding them feel the effect, and people begin to lose their income and their jobs.\n\nFrom the outside looking in, we see that some eateries pivot their businesses towards delivery. However, most food and beverage establishments in Malaysia are not built to fit the delivery model.\n\nEateries such as casual and fine dining restaurants depend on their ambience in addition to their menu. Additionally, not all foods and beverages such as soups and alcoholic drinks are favourable through delivery, and delivery services are costly which eats into the slim profit margins of these businesses and puts them in the red.\n\nThe united F&B joint statement\n\nZakaria Zayane / Unsplash\n\nBecause of the dire situation affecting F&B businesses and their supply chains, a coalition of five F&B associations held a press conference and released a joint statement addressing the matter.\n\nThey urge the Ministry of Health (MOH), National Security Council (MKN), Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP), and any related ministry to engage, discuss and debate with stakeholders (trade associations) for a solution.\n\nThe coalition believes by engaging with them, they could provide a wider perspective that could result in better policies and SOPs.\n\nWe are not asking for handouts, instead we need the government to be reasonable. The F&B industry has been a significantly small contributor to new clusters because many businesses have been compliant We appeal to Putrajaya, let our people come back to work, save small businesses and let us contribute to the nation again\n\nThe coalition is even prepared to help the government to deal with errant operators if their sector is allowed to reopen for dine-ins again.\n\nThe situation\n\nBased on a 2016 census done by The Department of Statistics, the coalition estimated that the move to not allow dine-ins has affected approximately 1 million Malaysians since 2020. This number does not include the farmers, fisheries, suppliers, distributors, and other businesses that depend on restaurants.\n\nThey said that many F&B operators have less than 2 months of cash flow left and are anticipating at least a 60% closure rate if the ban continues.\n\nAn intervention\n\nRowan Freeman / Unsplash\n\nThe coalition also urged the government to scrap the Essential and Non-Essential industry labels as a first step to finding a better solution.\n\nThey also ask that the government engage, and regulate the 2 largest food delivery platforms, as long as dining-in is not allowed.\n\nThe coalition requests a rebate of 15% on the food delivery commission rates from now till Jan 2022.\n\nThe reduction in commission rates can be made up from the influx of users and orders. At the same time, ensure the welfare of the riders is guarded. The review to lower our commission rates should not affect the rider\u2019s abilities to earn a living.\n\nAccording to the coalition, the 2 largest food delivery services charge 30% or more in commissions. This was accepted by most F&B businesses because delivery was seen as marketing and promotion while dine-in and takeaway are the main income.\n\nHowever, when dine-ins are not allowed the 30% commission not only cuts into profit but in a lot of cases make each sale a loss unless prices are increased accordingly.\n\nAt the ready\n\nThe members of the coalition also offer the mobilisation of their social media to help drive vaccination registration numbers, increase vaccine literacy, counter vaccine hesitancy, and reward vaccinated individuals.\n\nIn return, they urge Putrajaya to be transparent and accountable on the expected vaccine arrival timelines so that businesses can plan ahead.\n\nMeanwhile, the coalition of F&B businesses is also being proactive about their situation and is formulating a plan to help both the industry and those in need as well. The project is currently in its testing phase and shows promise.\n\nA balance between lives and livelihood\n\nThe coalition of F&B businesses is made up of the Persatuan Pemilik Restoran dan Bistro (PPRB), F&B Connects (FBCM), Malaysia F&B Alliance, Professional Culinaire Association (PCAM), HAPA Group, and Malaysia Food & Beverage Executives Association (MFBEA).\n\nThose who spoke at the briefing were Jeremy Lim, Vice President & Media Liaisons of PPRB, Ivy Hew from FBCM, Tony Lim from Malaysia F&B Alliance, Hisham Tan from MFBEA, Chef Bob from Professional Culinaire Association, and Dato Kenneth Soh from Persatuan Kebajikan Pengimpot dan Pengedar Minuman Keras Malaysia (PKPPMKM).\n\nExpress your thoughts on TRP\u2019s Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.", "keyword": ["lets", "dinein", "commission", "coalition", "hey", "allowing", "talk", "delivery", "dineins", "ministry", "fb", "food", "businesses", "rates", "vaccine"], "summary": "The united F&B joint statementZakaria Zayane / UnsplashBecause of the dire situation affecting F&B businesses and their supply chains, a coalition of five F&B associations held a press conference and released a joint statement addressing the matter.\nThey also ask that the government engage, and regulate the 2 largest food delivery platforms, as long as dining-in is not allowed.\nThe coalition requests a rebate of 15% on the food delivery commission rates from now till Jan 2022.\nThe review to lower our commission rates should not affect the rider\u2019s abilities to earn a living.\nThis was accepted by most F&B businesses because delivery was seen as marketing and promotion while dine-in and takeaway are the main income.", "news": "The Rakyat Post", "date": "2021-07-14 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "PIKAS for manufacturing to be expedited via online registration", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWFsYXlzaWFucmVzZXJ2ZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNy8xNS9waWthcy1mb3ItbWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy10by1iZS1leHBlZGl0ZWQtdmlhLW9ubGluZS1yZWdpc3RyYXRpb24v0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVtYWxheXNpYW5yZXNlcnZlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA3LzE1L3Bpa2FzLWZvci1tYW51ZmFjdHVyaW5nLXRvLWJlLWV4cGVkaXRlZC12aWEtb25saW5lLXJlZ2lzdHJhdGlvbi9hbXAv?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://themalaysianreserve.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/25TR006A1-1.jpg", "text": "by AZREEN HANI / Pic by TMR FILE PIX\n\nTHE government has introduced an online registration at http://pikas.miti.gov.my for the Covid-19 Public-Private Partnership Industrial Immunisation Program (PIKAS) for the manufacturing sector.\n\nAccording to the International Trade and Industry Ministry (MITI) companies that have previously sent their information via email before are recommended to enter their company\u2019s information in the PIKAS online system so that the information is complete for processing.\n\nDeputy minister Datuk Lim Ban Hong said PIKAS had received very high response and had helped support the acceleration of the vaccination rate for Malaysians.\n\n\u201cPIKAS plays a very important role in giving confidence to workers in the manufacturing sector to feel safe in the workplace.

As a result, many will not go the extra mile for patients because they are not motivated.\u201d\n\nThe specialist said there are many brilliant young doctors working with him but they do not know where they will be when their contracts expire.\n\nHe urged the government to quickly address the issue to ensure that the public health service can continue to provide the best care possible.", "keyword": ["specialist", "permanent", "mma", "positions", "opportunity", "doctor", "contract", "healthcare", "denies", "temporary", "specialists", "appointment", "doctors", "service", "public"], "summary": "The only way young doctors can achieve their goal of becoming specialists is to serve in public hospitals.\nHowever, if they are denied permanent positions, they lose that opportunity.\nThe doctor said there are now about 4,600 specialists in various disciplines serving in the public healthcare system.\nHe said if the government does not give existing contract doctors permanent positions, there will eventually be a shortage of specialists.\n\u201cI understand the frustrations many contract doctors are experiencing, because they do not know what their future holds.", "news": "The Sun Daily", "date": "2021-07-05 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Official MKN SOP For Phase 2 Of NRP As Of 23 July (In English)", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wNy8wNi9vZmZpY2lhbC1ta24tc29wLWZvci1waGFzZS0yLW9mLW5ycC1hcy1vZi01LWp1bHktaW4tZW5nbGlzaC_SAXdodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVyYWt5YXRwb3N0LmNvbS9uZXdzL21hbGF5c2lhLzIwMjEvMDcvMDYvb2ZmaWNpYWwtbWtuLXNvcC1mb3ItcGhhc2UtMi1vZi1ucnAtYXMtb2YtNS1qdWx5LWluLWVuZ2xpc2gvYW1wLw?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Azizul Rahman Ismail", "Maya Suraya"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SOP-Phase-2.jpeg", "text": "Subscribe to our new Telegram channel for the latest updates and stories.\n\nAfter the government announced that the National Recovery Plan (NRP) will be implemented state by state instead of nationwide and that 5 states will go into Phase 2 on July 5, new SOPs were released.\n\nRead More: Five States To Go Into Phase 2 on 5 July\n\nOn 7 July, Penang entered Phase 2.\n\nOn 9 July, Sabah entered Phase 2.\n\nOn 14 July Sarawak entered Phase 2.\n\nFor your convenience, TRP took the liberty of translating the latest Phase 2 standard operating procedures (SOP) released by the National Security Council (MKN) on 23 July.\n\nThe new Phase 2 SOP has some minor changes compared to the one released on 16 July.\n\nThe most notable changes are:\n\n60% of workers may return to the office.\n\nMost businesses may operate from 6 am to 10 pm.\n\nSports and recreational activities are allowed between 6 am and 10 pm.\n\nOutdoor filming is allowed.\n\nAccounting firms are allowed to open.\n\nWe marked all the differences in \u2018orange\u2018.\n\nAreas Involved\n\nKELANTAN, TERENGGANU, PAHANG, PERAK, PERLIS, PENANG, SABAH DAN SARAWAK.\n\n*For areas enforced by RMCO, the RMCO SOP in those areas is in force until the end of the RMCO.\n\nDuration\n\nEffective 5 July 2021 (12.01 am) \u2013 Kelantan, Terengganu, Pahang, Perak and Perlis.\n\nEffective 7 July 2021 (12.01 am) \u2013 Penang.\n\nEffective 9 July 2021 (12.01 am) \u2013 Sabah.

latest stories and updates.\n\nMalaysians have proven time and time again that they are worthy of international success in Cannes.\n\nFor some, making it to the Cannes commune figuratively or literally for a festival, award or even a holiday, is a marker of success for many.\n\nIn light of the recent news of the Cannes Film Festival returning after a year hiatus due to the Covid-19 pandemic, film buffs connoisseurs are anticipating a fresh breath of film talent across the globe.\n\nAlthough no Malaysian titles are showcased at the event this year, the city of Cannes on the French Riviera is still renowned for hosting other significant festivals and award shows like Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, and the Cannes Film Awards to name a couple.\n\nCannes Film Festival\n\nIn essence, the Cannes Film Festival is an annual film festival that previews new films of all genres, including documentaries from all around the world.\n\nAside from its main purpose, it is also a roll call for glitz, glam, networking, and parties.\n\nThat said, only a handful of Malaysians have graced this event and they are:\n\n1995: Film director U-Wei Haji Saari\u2019s film \u201cKaki Bakar\u201d (The Arsonist) was the first Malaysian production to be screened in the Un Certain Regard category. It is a take on William Faulkner\u2019s \u2018Barn Burnin\u2019 about the son of an itinerant worker who tries to prevent his volatile father from deliberately setting fires.\n\n2009: The second Malaysian to have been invited to the prestigious film festival is Chris Chong Chan Fui with his film \u201cKaraoke,\u201d which centres on a villagers way of life and the Malaysian palm oil industry. The film premiered in the Directors\u2019 Fortnight stream that year, an independent selection of the film festival.\n\n2010: Following in Karaoke\u2019s footsteps a year later at the Director\u2019s Fortnight is The Tiger Factory by Woo Ming Jin, a profoundly heartbreaking drama about \u201cbaby factories\u201d.\n\n2014: Malaysian documentary producer Indrani Kopal, a Fulbright scholar at the Hofstra University in New York at the time, was selected for her first production \u201cThe Game Changer\u201d. The documentary about Susan Slotnick, who uses dance as a form for rehabilitation for inmates at the Woodbourne Correctional Facility in New York, was shown at the Cannes Short Film Corner.\n\nCannes Film Awards\n\nMalaysians have also been making waves at the Cannes Film Awards. Not to be confused with the Cannes Film Festival, this international film festival celebrates film, filmmakers, producers, musicians, actors, screenwriters, photographers and the arts in general.\n\nThey aim to bring new names to the film industry and support new creators as well.\n\nRanked among the Top 100 most popular film festivals out of 10,000 festivals worldwide, the festival collaborates with experts in the field of European film art.\n\nIn its inaugural year this year, two Malaysians have each bagged an award at the Cannes Film Awards.\n\n\u201cTouch\u201d by Kurisu Lee, a 13-minute film about a young man and his dreams, won Best Asian Film in the Film Awards \u2013 Continental Category while \u201cGarbageman, Nurse, and Cop\u201d by Aiman Samat won Best Crime Film under the Film Awards \u2013 Additional Category.\n\nThe award show was held at the Cote d\u2019Azur Art Gallery in Cannes, France on 8 June.\n\nCannes Lions International Festival of Creativity\n\nFor the advertising and creative communications industry, winning a Cannes Lions is equivalent to being selected for the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nMalaysian agencies have in the past and are still currently winning large at this event.\n\nVJ Anand, former Executive Creative Director of advertising agency BBDO Malaysia and now Head of Creative of VaynerMedia in Singapore recalls the times Malaysia won big at Cannes Lions.\n\nMalaysia has always been pretty good at winning the global advertising stage and I\u2019m sure Malaysia will keep winning.\n\nHe remembers Southeast Asia\u2019s first and Malaysia\u2019s only Cannes Lions Grand Prix (the awards\u2019 most coveted honour) was in 2004 by JWT Malaysia for \u201cMissile Car\u201d, an imaginative guerrilla outdoor campaign to promote Channel Nine.\n\nSince, other creative agencies that have followed the shiny award trail include the following VJ has noted for us:\n\n2007: \u201cTang Hong Ming\u201d by Leo Burnett/Arc Worldwide Malaysia \u2013 a TV commercial by the acclaimed creative director and filmmaker Yasmin Ahmad. It was the first Malaysian TV commercial that ever won a Gold Cannes Lion and is still probably one of Malaysia\u2019s most memorable ads to date.\n\n2008: BBDO/Proximity Malaysia won Gold Lion for Chrysler Korea\u2019s campaign for Jeep in the Outdoor category.\n\n2015: When VJ was Group Executive Creative Director at TBWA\\Kuala Lumpur, they were awarded the Silver Lion for The Eveready Book of Play which was inspired by the traditional Malaysia form of storytelling, the Wayang Kulit (Shadow Play).\n\nMost recently this year, Grey Malaysia won Silver and Bronze Lion for WWF\u2019s Your Plastic Diet. And in association with the Cannes Lions, they also won the most coveted Grand Prix honour at the WARC Awards for Effectiveness for Tesco: Unforgettable Bag.\n\nThere have been many other Malaysians who have strutted away with a Cannes Lion, and for that we should be proud.\n\nREAD MORE: M\u2019sian filmmaker wins award at Cannes 2019 for incredible anti-bullying PSA", "keyword": ["cannes", "lion", "awards", "award", "international", "malaysians", "celebrating", "creative", "won", "festival", "lions", "malaysian"], "summary": "Malaysians have proven time and time again that they are worthy of international success in Cannes.\nCannes Film FestivalIn essence, the Cannes Film Festival is an annual film festival that previews new films of all genres, including documentaries from all around the world.\nIn its inaugural year this year, two Malaysians have each bagged an award at the Cannes Film Awards.\nCannes Lions International Festival of CreativityFor the advertising and creative communications industry, winning a Cannes Lions is equivalent to being selected for the Cannes Film Festival.\nThere have been many other Malaysians who have strutted away with a Cannes Lion, and for that we should be proud.", "news": "The Rakyat Post", "date": "2021-07-04 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "At least 17 killed in Philippines troop plane crash", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS93b3JsZC8yMDIxLzA3LzA0L2F0LWxlYXN0LTE3LWtpbGxlZC1pbi1waGlsaXBwaW5lcy10cm9vcC1wbGFuZS1jcmFzaC_SAQA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MashaMasha2022_1_800x500.jpg", "text": "MANILA: At least 17 people were killed when a Philippines Air Force plane carrying troops crashed on landing in the south of the country and broke up in flames today.\n\nThe Lockheed C-130 transport aircraft crashed at Patikul in Sulu province, in the far south of the archipelago nation where the army has been fighting a long war against Islamist militants from the Abu Sayyaf and other factions.\n\n\u201cSo far 40 wounded and injured were rescued and 17 bodies recovered.

There was hope that this all was going to be over soon.\n\nAs time went by, the rippling effect from the ban grew and that hope began to diminish. As restaurants and kitchens close or shut down, the economic ecosystem surrounding them feel the effect, and people begin to lose their income and their jobs.\n\nFrom the outside looking in, we see that some eateries pivot their businesses towards delivery. However, most food and beverage establishments in Malaysia are not built to fit the delivery model.\n\nEateries such as casual and fine dining restaurants depend on their ambience in addition to their menu. Additionally, not all foods and beverages such as soups and alcoholic drinks are favourable through delivery, and delivery services are costly which eats into the slim profit margins of these businesses and puts them in the red.\n\nThe united F&B joint statement\n\nZakaria Zayane / Unsplash\n\nBecause of the dire situation affecting F&B businesses and their supply chains, a coalition of five F&B associations held a press conference and released a joint statement addressing the matter.\n\nThey urge the Ministry of Health (MOH), National Security Council (MKN), Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP), and any related ministry to engage, discuss and debate with stakeholders (trade associations) for a solution.\n\nThe coalition believes by engaging with them, they could provide a wider perspective that could result in better policies and SOPs.\n\nWe are not asking for handouts, instead we need the government to be reasonable. The F&B industry has been a significantly small contributor to new clusters because many businesses have been compliant We appeal to Putrajaya, let our people come back to work, save small businesses and let us contribute to the nation again\n\nThe coalition is even prepared to help the government to deal with errant operators if their sector is allowed to reopen for dine-ins again.\n\nThe situation\n\nBased on a 2016 census done by The Department of Statistics, the coalition estimated that the move to not allow dine-ins has affected approximately 1 million Malaysians since 2020. This number does not include the farmers, fisheries, suppliers, distributors, and other businesses that depend on restaurants.\n\nThey said that many F&B operators have less than 2 months of cash flow left and are anticipating at least a 60% closure rate if the ban continues.\n\nAn intervention\n\nRowan Freeman / Unsplash\n\nThe coalition also urged the government to scrap the Essential and Non-Essential industry labels as a first step to finding a better solution.\n\nThey also ask that the government engage, and regulate the 2 largest food delivery platforms, as long as dining-in is not allowed.\n\nThe coalition requests a rebate of 15% on the food delivery commission rates from now till Jan 2022.\n\nThe reduction in commission rates can be made up from the influx of users and orders. At the same time, ensure the welfare of the riders is guarded. The review to lower our commission rates should not affect the rider\u2019s abilities to earn a living.\n\nAccording to the coalition, the 2 largest food delivery services charge 30% or more in commissions. This was accepted by most F&B businesses because delivery was seen as marketing and promotion while dine-in and takeaway are the main income.\n\nHowever, when dine-ins are not allowed the 30% commission not only cuts into profit but in a lot of cases make each sale a loss unless prices are increased accordingly.\n\nAt the ready\n\nThe members of the coalition also offer the mobilisation of their social media to help drive vaccination registration numbers, increase vaccine literacy, counter vaccine hesitancy, and reward vaccinated individuals.\n\nIn return, they urge Putrajaya to be transparent and accountable on the expected vaccine arrival timelines so that businesses can plan ahead.\n\nMeanwhile, the coalition of F&B businesses is also being proactive about their situation and is formulating a plan to help both the industry and those in need as well.

The approach to managing both the pandemic and its human consequences have been the same since March last year,\u201d Nungsari said.\n\nMeanwhile, Universiti Putra Malaysia political scientist Prof Dr Jayum Jawan said the effort to address the pandemic and the crippling of the economy and lives should not be confused and conflated with one another.\n\n\u201cThe government at both federal and state levels is putting measures in a concerted effort to manage the pandemic.

So, when the 2018 general election produced no clear majority to any group or political party, the situation becomes vulnerable and the jockeying for power becomes highly tense,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that this volatile period is also aggravated by the fact that some politicians are not ashamed to \u201cjump ship\u201d, and ruling parties or coalitions are also known in the past to have enticed members of legislature from other parties in order to secure a comfortable legislative support.", "keyword": ["wellcoordinated", "instability", "governments", "manage", "effort", "response", "affect", "parties", "majority", "covid", "power", "pandemic", "nungsari", "political"], "summary": "Key industrial hubs such as the Klang Valley and Selangor are still unable to flatten the curveby HARIZAH KAMEL / pic by TMR FILETHE current political instability may affect the government\u2019s ability to implement an effective, well-coordinated plan to manage Covid-19 situation in Malaysia.\n\u201cNevertheless, the continuing political uncertainties could further undermine the government\u2019s ability to implement a well-coordinated, carefully planned and effective response to the twin public health and economic crisis facing the country,\u201d he said.\nYeah noted that political instability is adding to public exasperation over the stubbornly high daily infection cases and mounting economic losses due to the second nation-wide lockdown.\n\u201cThe government at both federal and state levels is putting measures in a concerted effort to manage the pandemic.\nCommenting further on politics, he said the contestation for political power will continue to characterise Malaysia\u2019s politics for some time to come.", "news": "The Malaysian Reserve", "date": "2021-07-12 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "PPV volunteers should be fully vaccinated", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWFsYXlzaWFucmVzZXJ2ZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNy8xNC9wcHYtdm9sdW50ZWVycy1zaG91bGQtYmUtZnVsbHktdmFjY2luYXRlZC_SAVlodHRwczovL3RoZW1hbGF5c2lhbnJlc2VydmUuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvMTQvcHB2LXZvbHVudGVlcnMtc2hvdWxkLWJlLWZ1bGx5LXZhY2NpbmF0ZWQvYW1wLw?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://themalaysianreserve.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MITEC-PIKAS-Vaccine.jpg", "text": "by ASILA JALIL / pic by TMR FILE\n\nVOLUNTEERS and staff members at vaccination centres (PPVs) should be fully vaccinated before they are allowed to perform their duties at the centres.\n\nOsel group chief clinical and innovative scientist Dr Kris See said the Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) should only consider taking in fully vaccinated individuals as volunteers to reduce the symptoms and spread of the virus.\n\n\u201cI think at the fundamental level, CITF should ensure all volunteers are vaccinated completely with two doses.

As a result, many will not go the extra mile for patients because they are not motivated.\u201d\n\nThe specialist said there are many brilliant young doctors working with him but they do not know where they will be when their contracts expire.\n\nHe urged the government to quickly address the issue to ensure that the public health service can continue to provide the best care possible.", "keyword": ["specialist", "permanent", "mma", "positions", "opportunity", "doctor", "contract", "healthcare", "denies", "temporary", "specialists", "appointment", "doctors", "service", "public"], "summary": "The only way young doctors can achieve their goal of becoming specialists is to serve in public hospitals.\nHowever, if they are denied permanent positions, they lose that opportunity.\nThe doctor said there are now about 4,600 specialists in various disciplines serving in the public healthcare system.\nHe said if the government does not give existing contract doctors permanent positions, there will eventually be a shortage of specialists.\n\u201cI understand the frustrations many contract doctors are experiencing, because they do not know what their future holds.", "news": "The Sun Daily", "date": "2021-07-05 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Official MKN SOP For Phase 2 Of NRP As Of 23 July (In English)", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wNy8wNi9vZmZpY2lhbC1ta24tc29wLWZvci1waGFzZS0yLW9mLW5ycC1hcy1vZi01LWp1bHktaW4tZW5nbGlzaC_SAXdodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVyYWt5YXRwb3N0LmNvbS9uZXdzL21hbGF5c2lhLzIwMjEvMDcvMDYvb2ZmaWNpYWwtbWtuLXNvcC1mb3ItcGhhc2UtMi1vZi1ucnAtYXMtb2YtNS1qdWx5LWluLWVuZ2xpc2gvYW1wLw?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Azizul Rahman Ismail", "Maya Suraya"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SOP-Phase-2.jpeg", "text": "Subscribe to our new Telegram channel for the latest updates and stories.\n\nAfter the government announced that the National Recovery Plan (NRP) will be implemented state by state instead of nationwide and that 5 states will go into Phase 2 on July 5, new SOPs were released.\n\nRead More: Five States To Go Into Phase 2 on 5 July\n\nOn 7 July, Penang entered Phase 2.\n\nOn 9 July, Sabah entered Phase 2.\n\nOn 14 July Sarawak entered Phase 2.\n\nFor your convenience, TRP took the liberty of translating the latest Phase 2 standard operating procedures (SOP) released by the National Security Council (MKN) on 23 July.\n\nThe new Phase 2 SOP has some minor changes compared to the one released on 16 July.\n\nThe most notable changes are:\n\n60% of workers may return to the office.\n\nMost businesses may operate from 6 am to 10 pm.\n\nSports and recreational activities are allowed between 6 am and 10 pm.\n\nOutdoor filming is allowed.\n\nAccounting firms are allowed to open.\n\nWe marked all the differences in \u2018orange\u2018.\n\nAreas Involved\n\nKELANTAN, TERENGGANU, PAHANG, PERAK, PERLIS, PENANG, SABAH DAN SARAWAK.\n\n*For areas enforced by RMCO, the RMCO SOP in those areas is in force until the end of the RMCO.\n\nDuration\n\nEffective 5 July 2021 (12.01 am) \u2013 Kelantan, Terengganu, Pahang, Perak and Perlis.\n\nEffective 7 July 2021 (12.01 am) \u2013 Penang.\n\nEffective 9 July 2021 (12.01 am) \u2013 Sabah.

latest stories and updates.\n\nMalaysians have proven time and time again that they are worthy of international success in Cannes.\n\nFor some, making it to the Cannes commune figuratively or literally for a festival, award or even a holiday, is a marker of success for many.\n\nIn light of the recent news of the Cannes Film Festival returning after a year hiatus due to the Covid-19 pandemic, film buffs connoisseurs are anticipating a fresh breath of film talent across the globe.\n\nAlthough no Malaysian titles are showcased at the event this year, the city of Cannes on the French Riviera is still renowned for hosting other significant festivals and award shows like Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, and the Cannes Film Awards to name a couple.\n\nCannes Film Festival\n\nIn essence, the Cannes Film Festival is an annual film festival that previews new films of all genres, including documentaries from all around the world.\n\nAside from its main purpose, it is also a roll call for glitz, glam, networking, and parties.\n\nThat said, only a handful of Malaysians have graced this event and they are:\n\n1995: Film director U-Wei Haji Saari\u2019s film \u201cKaki Bakar\u201d (The Arsonist) was the first Malaysian production to be screened in the Un Certain Regard category. It is a take on William Faulkner\u2019s \u2018Barn Burnin\u2019 about the son of an itinerant worker who tries to prevent his volatile father from deliberately setting fires.\n\n2009: The second Malaysian to have been invited to the prestigious film festival is Chris Chong Chan Fui with his film \u201cKaraoke,\u201d which centres on a villagers way of life and the Malaysian palm oil industry. The film premiered in the Directors\u2019 Fortnight stream that year, an independent selection of the film festival.\n\n2010: Following in Karaoke\u2019s footsteps a year later at the Director\u2019s Fortnight is The Tiger Factory by Woo Ming Jin, a profoundly heartbreaking drama about \u201cbaby factories\u201d.\n\n2014: Malaysian documentary producer Indrani Kopal, a Fulbright scholar at the Hofstra University in New York at the time, was selected for her first production \u201cThe Game Changer\u201d. The documentary about Susan Slotnick, who uses dance as a form for rehabilitation for inmates at the Woodbourne Correctional Facility in New York, was shown at the Cannes Short Film Corner.\n\nCannes Film Awards\n\nMalaysians have also been making waves at the Cannes Film Awards. Not to be confused with the Cannes Film Festival, this international film festival celebrates film, filmmakers, producers, musicians, actors, screenwriters, photographers and the arts in general.\n\nThey aim to bring new names to the film industry and support new creators as well.\n\nRanked among the Top 100 most popular film festivals out of 10,000 festivals worldwide, the festival collaborates with experts in the field of European film art.\n\nIn its inaugural year this year, two Malaysians have each bagged an award at the Cannes Film Awards.\n\n\u201cTouch\u201d by Kurisu Lee, a 13-minute film about a young man and his dreams, won Best Asian Film in the Film Awards \u2013 Continental Category while \u201cGarbageman, Nurse, and Cop\u201d by Aiman Samat won Best Crime Film under the Film Awards \u2013 Additional Category.\n\nThe award show was held at the Cote d\u2019Azur Art Gallery in Cannes, France on 8 June.\n\nCannes Lions International Festival of Creativity\n\nFor the advertising and creative communications industry, winning a Cannes Lions is equivalent to being selected for the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nMalaysian agencies have in the past and are still currently winning large at this event.\n\nVJ Anand, former Executive Creative Director of advertising agency BBDO Malaysia and now Head of Creative of VaynerMedia in Singapore recalls the times Malaysia won big at Cannes Lions.\n\nMalaysia has always been pretty good at winning the global advertising stage and I\u2019m sure Malaysia will keep winning.\n\nHe remembers Southeast Asia\u2019s first and Malaysia\u2019s only Cannes Lions Grand Prix (the awards\u2019 most coveted honour) was in 2004 by JWT Malaysia for \u201cMissile Car\u201d, an imaginative guerrilla outdoor campaign to promote Channel Nine.\n\nSince, other creative agencies that have followed the shiny award trail include the following VJ has noted for us:\n\n2007: \u201cTang Hong Ming\u201d by Leo Burnett/Arc Worldwide Malaysia \u2013 a TV commercial by the acclaimed creative director and filmmaker Yasmin Ahmad. It was the first Malaysian TV commercial that ever won a Gold Cannes Lion and is still probably one of Malaysia\u2019s most memorable ads to date.\n\n2008: BBDO/Proximity Malaysia won Gold Lion for Chrysler Korea\u2019s campaign for Jeep in the Outdoor category.\n\n2015: When VJ was Group Executive Creative Director at TBWA\\Kuala Lumpur, they were awarded the Silver Lion for The Eveready Book of Play which was inspired by the traditional Malaysia form of storytelling, the Wayang Kulit (Shadow Play).\n\nMost recently this year, Grey Malaysia won Silver and Bronze Lion for WWF\u2019s Your Plastic Diet. And in association with the Cannes Lions, they also won the most coveted Grand Prix honour at the WARC Awards for Effectiveness for Tesco: Unforgettable Bag.\n\nThere have been many other Malaysians who have strutted away with a Cannes Lion, and for that we should be proud.\n\nREAD MORE: M\u2019sian filmmaker wins award at Cannes 2019 for incredible anti-bullying PSA", "keyword": ["cannes", "lion", "awards", "award", "international", "malaysians", "celebrating", "creative", "won", "festival", "lions", "malaysian"], "summary": "Malaysians have proven time and time again that they are worthy of international success in Cannes.\nCannes Film FestivalIn essence, the Cannes Film Festival is an annual film festival that previews new films of all genres, including documentaries from all around the world.\nIn its inaugural year this year, two Malaysians have each bagged an award at the Cannes Film Awards.\nCannes Lions International Festival of CreativityFor the advertising and creative communications industry, winning a Cannes Lions is equivalent to being selected for the Cannes Film Festival.\nThere have been many other Malaysians who have strutted away with a Cannes Lion, and for that we should be proud.", "news": "The Rakyat Post", "date": "2021-07-04 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "At least 17 killed in Philippines troop plane crash", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS93b3JsZC8yMDIxLzA3LzA0L2F0LWxlYXN0LTE3LWtpbGxlZC1pbi1waGlsaXBwaW5lcy10cm9vcC1wbGFuZS1jcmFzaC_SAQA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MashaMasha2022_1_800x500.jpg", "text": "MANILA: At least 17 people were killed when a Philippines Air Force plane carrying troops crashed on landing in the south of the country and broke up in flames today.\n\nThe Lockheed C-130 transport aircraft crashed at Patikul in Sulu province, in the far south of the archipelago nation where the army has been fighting a long war against Islamist militants from the Abu Sayyaf and other factions.\n\n\u201cSo far 40 wounded and injured were rescued and 17 bodies recovered.

There was hope that this all was going to be over soon.\n\nAs time went by, the rippling effect from the ban grew and that hope began to diminish. As restaurants and kitchens close or shut down, the economic ecosystem surrounding them feel the effect, and people begin to lose their income and their jobs.\n\nFrom the outside looking in, we see that some eateries pivot their businesses towards delivery. However, most food and beverage establishments in Malaysia are not built to fit the delivery model.\n\nEateries such as casual and fine dining restaurants depend on their ambience in addition to their menu. Additionally, not all foods and beverages such as soups and alcoholic drinks are favourable through delivery, and delivery services are costly which eats into the slim profit margins of these businesses and puts them in the red.\n\nThe united F&B joint statement\n\nZakaria Zayane / Unsplash\n\nBecause of the dire situation affecting F&B businesses and their supply chains, a coalition of five F&B associations held a press conference and released a joint statement addressing the matter.\n\nThey urge the Ministry of Health (MOH), National Security Council (MKN), Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP), and any related ministry to engage, discuss and debate with stakeholders (trade associations) for a solution.\n\nThe coalition believes by engaging with them, they could provide a wider perspective that could result in better policies and SOPs.\n\nWe are not asking for handouts, instead we need the government to be reasonable. The F&B industry has been a significantly small contributor to new clusters because many businesses have been compliant We appeal to Putrajaya, let our people come back to work, save small businesses and let us contribute to the nation again\n\nThe coalition is even prepared to help the government to deal with errant operators if their sector is allowed to reopen for dine-ins again.\n\nThe situation\n\nBased on a 2016 census done by The Department of Statistics, the coalition estimated that the move to not allow dine-ins has affected approximately 1 million Malaysians since 2020. This number does not include the farmers, fisheries, suppliers, distributors, and other businesses that depend on restaurants.\n\nThey said that many F&B operators have less than 2 months of cash flow left and are anticipating at least a 60% closure rate if the ban continues.\n\nAn intervention\n\nRowan Freeman / Unsplash\n\nThe coalition also urged the government to scrap the Essential and Non-Essential industry labels as a first step to finding a better solution.\n\nThey also ask that the government engage, and regulate the 2 largest food delivery platforms, as long as dining-in is not allowed.\n\nThe coalition requests a rebate of 15% on the food delivery commission rates from now till Jan 2022.\n\nThe reduction in commission rates can be made up from the influx of users and orders. At the same time, ensure the welfare of the riders is guarded. The review to lower our commission rates should not affect the rider\u2019s abilities to earn a living.\n\nAccording to the coalition, the 2 largest food delivery services charge 30% or more in commissions. This was accepted by most F&B businesses because delivery was seen as marketing and promotion while dine-in and takeaway are the main income.\n\nHowever, when dine-ins are not allowed the 30% commission not only cuts into profit but in a lot of cases make each sale a loss unless prices are increased accordingly.\n\nAt the ready\n\nThe members of the coalition also offer the mobilisation of their social media to help drive vaccination registration numbers, increase vaccine literacy, counter vaccine hesitancy, and reward vaccinated individuals.\n\nIn return, they urge Putrajaya to be transparent and accountable on the expected vaccine arrival timelines so that businesses can plan ahead.\n\nMeanwhile, the coalition of F&B businesses is also being proactive about their situation and is formulating a plan to help both the industry and those in need as well.

The approach to managing both the pandemic and its human consequences have been the same since March last year,\u201d Nungsari said.\n\nMeanwhile, Universiti Putra Malaysia political scientist Prof Dr Jayum Jawan said the effort to address the pandemic and the crippling of the economy and lives should not be confused and conflated with one another.\n\n\u201cThe government at both federal and state levels is putting measures in a concerted effort to manage the pandemic.

So, when the 2018 general election produced no clear majority to any group or political party, the situation becomes vulnerable and the jockeying for power becomes highly tense,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that this volatile period is also aggravated by the fact that some politicians are not ashamed to \u201cjump ship\u201d, and ruling parties or coalitions are also known in the past to have enticed members of legislature from other parties in order to secure a comfortable legislative support.", "keyword": ["wellcoordinated", "instability", "governments", "manage", "effort", "response", "affect", "parties", "majority", "covid", "power", "pandemic", "nungsari", "political"], "summary": "Key industrial hubs such as the Klang Valley and Selangor are still unable to flatten the curveby HARIZAH KAMEL / pic by TMR FILETHE current political instability may affect the government\u2019s ability to implement an effective, well-coordinated plan to manage Covid-19 situation in Malaysia.\n\u201cNevertheless, the continuing political uncertainties could further undermine the government\u2019s ability to implement a well-coordinated, carefully planned and effective response to the twin public health and economic crisis facing the country,\u201d he said.\nYeah noted that political instability is adding to public exasperation over the stubbornly high daily infection cases and mounting economic losses due to the second nation-wide lockdown.\n\u201cThe government at both federal and state levels is putting measures in a concerted effort to manage the pandemic.\nCommenting further on politics, he said the contestation for political power will continue to characterise Malaysia\u2019s politics for some time to come.", "news": "The Malaysian Reserve", "date": "2021-07-12 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "PPV volunteers should be fully vaccinated", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWFsYXlzaWFucmVzZXJ2ZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNy8xNC9wcHYtdm9sdW50ZWVycy1zaG91bGQtYmUtZnVsbHktdmFjY2luYXRlZC_SAVlodHRwczovL3RoZW1hbGF5c2lhbnJlc2VydmUuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvMTQvcHB2LXZvbHVudGVlcnMtc2hvdWxkLWJlLWZ1bGx5LXZhY2NpbmF0ZWQvYW1wLw?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://themalaysianreserve.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MITEC-PIKAS-Vaccine.jpg", "text": "by ASILA JALIL / pic by TMR FILE\n\nVOLUNTEERS and staff members at vaccination centres (PPVs) should be fully vaccinated before they are allowed to perform their duties at the centres.\n\nOsel group chief clinical and innovative scientist Dr Kris See said the Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) should only consider taking in fully vaccinated individuals as volunteers to reduce the symptoms and spread of the virus.\n\n\u201cI think at the fundamental level, CITF should ensure all volunteers are vaccinated completely with two doses.

As a result, many will not go the extra mile for patients because they are not motivated.\u201d\n\nThe specialist said there are many brilliant young doctors working with him but they do not know where they will be when their contracts expire.\n\nHe urged the government to quickly address the issue to ensure that the public health service can continue to provide the best care possible.", "keyword": ["specialist", "permanent", "mma", "positions", "opportunity", "doctor", "contract", "healthcare", "denies", "temporary", "specialists", "appointment", "doctors", "service", "public"], "summary": "The only way young doctors can achieve their goal of becoming specialists is to serve in public hospitals.\nHowever, if they are denied permanent positions, they lose that opportunity.\nThe doctor said there are now about 4,600 specialists in various disciplines serving in the public healthcare system.\nHe said if the government does not give existing contract doctors permanent positions, there will eventually be a shortage of specialists.\n\u201cI understand the frustrations many contract doctors are experiencing, because they do not know what their future holds.", "news": "The Sun Daily", "date": "2021-07-05 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Official MKN SOP For Phase 2 Of NRP As Of 23 July (In English)", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wNy8wNi9vZmZpY2lhbC1ta24tc29wLWZvci1waGFzZS0yLW9mLW5ycC1hcy1vZi01LWp1bHktaW4tZW5nbGlzaC_SAXdodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVyYWt5YXRwb3N0LmNvbS9uZXdzL21hbGF5c2lhLzIwMjEvMDcvMDYvb2ZmaWNpYWwtbWtuLXNvcC1mb3ItcGhhc2UtMi1vZi1ucnAtYXMtb2YtNS1qdWx5LWluLWVuZ2xpc2gvYW1wLw?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Azizul Rahman Ismail", "Maya Suraya"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SOP-Phase-2.jpeg", "text": "Subscribe to our new Telegram channel for the latest updates and stories.\n\nAfter the government announced that the National Recovery Plan (NRP) will be implemented state by state instead of nationwide and that 5 states will go into Phase 2 on July 5, new SOPs were released.\n\nRead More: Five States To Go Into Phase 2 on 5 July\n\nOn 7 July, Penang entered Phase 2.\n\nOn 9 July, Sabah entered Phase 2.\n\nOn 14 July Sarawak entered Phase 2.\n\nFor your convenience, TRP took the liberty of translating the latest Phase 2 standard operating procedures (SOP) released by the National Security Council (MKN) on 23 July.\n\nThe new Phase 2 SOP has some minor changes compared to the one released on 16 July.\n\nThe most notable changes are:\n\n60% of workers may return to the office.\n\nMost businesses may operate from 6 am to 10 pm.\n\nSports and recreational activities are allowed between 6 am and 10 pm.\n\nOutdoor filming is allowed.\n\nAccounting firms are allowed to open.\n\nWe marked all the differences in \u2018orange\u2018.\n\nAreas Involved\n\nKELANTAN, TERENGGANU, PAHANG, PERAK, PERLIS, PENANG, SABAH DAN SARAWAK.\n\n*For areas enforced by RMCO, the RMCO SOP in those areas is in force until the end of the RMCO.\n\nDuration\n\nEffective 5 July 2021 (12.01 am) \u2013 Kelantan, Terengganu, Pahang, Perak and Perlis.\n\nEffective 7 July 2021 (12.01 am) \u2013 Penang.\n\nEffective 9 July 2021 (12.01 am) \u2013 Sabah.

latest stories and updates.\n\nMalaysians have proven time and time again that they are worthy of international success in Cannes.\n\nFor some, making it to the Cannes commune figuratively or literally for a festival, award or even a holiday, is a marker of success for many.\n\nIn light of the recent news of the Cannes Film Festival returning after a year hiatus due to the Covid-19 pandemic, film buffs connoisseurs are anticipating a fresh breath of film talent across the globe.\n\nAlthough no Malaysian titles are showcased at the event this year, the city of Cannes on the French Riviera is still renowned for hosting other significant festivals and award shows like Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, and the Cannes Film Awards to name a couple.\n\nCannes Film Festival\n\nIn essence, the Cannes Film Festival is an annual film festival that previews new films of all genres, including documentaries from all around the world.\n\nAside from its main purpose, it is also a roll call for glitz, glam, networking, and parties.\n\nThat said, only a handful of Malaysians have graced this event and they are:\n\n1995: Film director U-Wei Haji Saari\u2019s film \u201cKaki Bakar\u201d (The Arsonist) was the first Malaysian production to be screened in the Un Certain Regard category. It is a take on William Faulkner\u2019s \u2018Barn Burnin\u2019 about the son of an itinerant worker who tries to prevent his volatile father from deliberately setting fires.\n\n2009: The second Malaysian to have been invited to the prestigious film festival is Chris Chong Chan Fui with his film \u201cKaraoke,\u201d which centres on a villagers way of life and the Malaysian palm oil industry. The film premiered in the Directors\u2019 Fortnight stream that year, an independent selection of the film festival.\n\n2010: Following in Karaoke\u2019s footsteps a year later at the Director\u2019s Fortnight is The Tiger Factory by Woo Ming Jin, a profoundly heartbreaking drama about \u201cbaby factories\u201d.\n\n2014: Malaysian documentary producer Indrani Kopal, a Fulbright scholar at the Hofstra University in New York at the time, was selected for her first production \u201cThe Game Changer\u201d. The documentary about Susan Slotnick, who uses dance as a form for rehabilitation for inmates at the Woodbourne Correctional Facility in New York, was shown at the Cannes Short Film Corner.\n\nCannes Film Awards\n\nMalaysians have also been making waves at the Cannes Film Awards. Not to be confused with the Cannes Film Festival, this international film festival celebrates film, filmmakers, producers, musicians, actors, screenwriters, photographers and the arts in general.\n\nThey aim to bring new names to the film industry and support new creators as well.\n\nRanked among the Top 100 most popular film festivals out of 10,000 festivals worldwide, the festival collaborates with experts in the field of European film art.\n\nIn its inaugural year this year, two Malaysians have each bagged an award at the Cannes Film Awards.\n\n\u201cTouch\u201d by Kurisu Lee, a 13-minute film about a young man and his dreams, won Best Asian Film in the Film Awards \u2013 Continental Category while \u201cGarbageman, Nurse, and Cop\u201d by Aiman Samat won Best Crime Film under the Film Awards \u2013 Additional Category.\n\nThe award show was held at the Cote d\u2019Azur Art Gallery in Cannes, France on 8 June.\n\nCannes Lions International Festival of Creativity\n\nFor the advertising and creative communications industry, winning a Cannes Lions is equivalent to being selected for the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nMalaysian agencies have in the past and are still currently winning large at this event.\n\nVJ Anand, former Executive Creative Director of advertising agency BBDO Malaysia and now Head of Creative of VaynerMedia in Singapore recalls the times Malaysia won big at Cannes Lions.\n\nMalaysia has always been pretty good at winning the global advertising stage and I\u2019m sure Malaysia will keep winning.\n\nHe remembers Southeast Asia\u2019s first and Malaysia\u2019s only Cannes Lions Grand Prix (the awards\u2019 most coveted honour) was in 2004 by JWT Malaysia for \u201cMissile Car\u201d, an imaginative guerrilla outdoor campaign to promote Channel Nine.\n\nSince, other creative agencies that have followed the shiny award trail include the following VJ has noted for us:\n\n2007: \u201cTang Hong Ming\u201d by Leo Burnett/Arc Worldwide Malaysia \u2013 a TV commercial by the acclaimed creative director and filmmaker Yasmin Ahmad. It was the first Malaysian TV commercial that ever won a Gold Cannes Lion and is still probably one of Malaysia\u2019s most memorable ads to date.\n\n2008: BBDO/Proximity Malaysia won Gold Lion for Chrysler Korea\u2019s campaign for Jeep in the Outdoor category.\n\n2015: When VJ was Group Executive Creative Director at TBWA\\Kuala Lumpur, they were awarded the Silver Lion for The Eveready Book of Play which was inspired by the traditional Malaysia form of storytelling, the Wayang Kulit (Shadow Play).\n\nMost recently this year, Grey Malaysia won Silver and Bronze Lion for WWF\u2019s Your Plastic Diet. And in association with the Cannes Lions, they also won the most coveted Grand Prix honour at the WARC Awards for Effectiveness for Tesco: Unforgettable Bag.\n\nThere have been many other Malaysians who have strutted away with a Cannes Lion, and for that we should be proud.\n\nREAD MORE: M\u2019sian filmmaker wins award at Cannes 2019 for incredible anti-bullying PSA", "keyword": ["cannes", "lion", "awards", "award", "international", "malaysians", "celebrating", "creative", "won", "festival", "lions", "malaysian"], "summary": "Malaysians have proven time and time again that they are worthy of international success in Cannes.\nCannes Film FestivalIn essence, the Cannes Film Festival is an annual film festival that previews new films of all genres, including documentaries from all around the world.\nIn its inaugural year this year, two Malaysians have each bagged an award at the Cannes Film Awards.\nCannes Lions International Festival of CreativityFor the advertising and creative communications industry, winning a Cannes Lions is equivalent to being selected for the Cannes Film Festival.\nThere have been many other Malaysians who have strutted away with a Cannes Lion, and for that we should be proud.", "news": "The Rakyat Post", "date": "2021-07-04 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "At least 17 killed in Philippines troop plane crash", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS93b3JsZC8yMDIxLzA3LzA0L2F0LWxlYXN0LTE3LWtpbGxlZC1pbi1waGlsaXBwaW5lcy10cm9vcC1wbGFuZS1jcmFzaC_SAQA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MashaMasha2022_1_800x500.jpg", "text": "MANILA: At least 17 people were killed when a Philippines Air Force plane carrying troops crashed on landing in the south of the country and broke up in flames today.\n\nThe Lockheed C-130 transport aircraft crashed at Patikul in Sulu province, in the far south of the archipelago nation where the army has been fighting a long war against Islamist militants from the Abu Sayyaf and other factions.\n\n\u201cSo far 40 wounded and injured were rescued and 17 bodies recovered.

There was hope that this all was going to be over soon.\n\nAs time went by, the rippling effect from the ban grew and that hope began to diminish. As restaurants and kitchens close or shut down, the economic ecosystem surrounding them feel the effect, and people begin to lose their income and their jobs.\n\nFrom the outside looking in, we see that some eateries pivot their businesses towards delivery. However, most food and beverage establishments in Malaysia are not built to fit the delivery model.\n\nEateries such as casual and fine dining restaurants depend on their ambience in addition to their menu. Additionally, not all foods and beverages such as soups and alcoholic drinks are favourable through delivery, and delivery services are costly which eats into the slim profit margins of these businesses and puts them in the red.\n\nThe united F&B joint statement\n\nZakaria Zayane / Unsplash\n\nBecause of the dire situation affecting F&B businesses and their supply chains, a coalition of five F&B associations held a press conference and released a joint statement addressing the matter.\n\nThey urge the Ministry of Health (MOH), National Security Council (MKN), Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP), and any related ministry to engage, discuss and debate with stakeholders (trade associations) for a solution.\n\nThe coalition believes by engaging with them, they could provide a wider perspective that could result in better policies and SOPs.\n\nWe are not asking for handouts, instead we need the government to be reasonable. The F&B industry has been a significantly small contributor to new clusters because many businesses have been compliant We appeal to Putrajaya, let our people come back to work, save small businesses and let us contribute to the nation again\n\nThe coalition is even prepared to help the government to deal with errant operators if their sector is allowed to reopen for dine-ins again.\n\nThe situation\n\nBased on a 2016 census done by The Department of Statistics, the coalition estimated that the move to not allow dine-ins has affected approximately 1 million Malaysians since 2020. This number does not include the farmers, fisheries, suppliers, distributors, and other businesses that depend on restaurants.\n\nThey said that many F&B operators have less than 2 months of cash flow left and are anticipating at least a 60% closure rate if the ban continues.\n\nAn intervention\n\nRowan Freeman / Unsplash\n\nThe coalition also urged the government to scrap the Essential and Non-Essential industry labels as a first step to finding a better solution.\n\nThey also ask that the government engage, and regulate the 2 largest food delivery platforms, as long as dining-in is not allowed.\n\nThe coalition requests a rebate of 15% on the food delivery commission rates from now till Jan 2022.\n\nThe reduction in commission rates can be made up from the influx of users and orders. At the same time, ensure the welfare of the riders is guarded. The review to lower our commission rates should not affect the rider\u2019s abilities to earn a living.\n\nAccording to the coalition, the 2 largest food delivery services charge 30% or more in commissions. This was accepted by most F&B businesses because delivery was seen as marketing and promotion while dine-in and takeaway are the main income.\n\nHowever, when dine-ins are not allowed the 30% commission not only cuts into profit but in a lot of cases make each sale a loss unless prices are increased accordingly.\n\nAt the ready\n\nThe members of the coalition also offer the mobilisation of their social media to help drive vaccination registration numbers, increase vaccine literacy, counter vaccine hesitancy, and reward vaccinated individuals.\n\nIn return, they urge Putrajaya to be transparent and accountable on the expected vaccine arrival timelines so that businesses can plan ahead.\n\nMeanwhile, the coalition of F&B businesses is also being proactive about their situation and is formulating a plan to help both the industry and those in need as well.

The approach to managing both the pandemic and its human consequences have been the same since March last year,\u201d Nungsari said.\n\nMeanwhile, Universiti Putra Malaysia political scientist Prof Dr Jayum Jawan said the effort to address the pandemic and the crippling of the economy and lives should not be confused and conflated with one another.\n\n\u201cThe government at both federal and state levels is putting measures in a concerted effort to manage the pandemic.

So, when the 2018 general election produced no clear majority to any group or political party, the situation becomes vulnerable and the jockeying for power becomes highly tense,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that this volatile period is also aggravated by the fact that some politicians are not ashamed to \u201cjump ship\u201d, and ruling parties or coalitions are also known in the past to have enticed members of legislature from other parties in order to secure a comfortable legislative support.", "keyword": ["wellcoordinated", "instability", "governments", "manage", "effort", "response", "affect", "parties", "majority", "covid", "power", "pandemic", "nungsari", "political"], "summary": "Key industrial hubs such as the Klang Valley and Selangor are still unable to flatten the curveby HARIZAH KAMEL / pic by TMR FILETHE current political instability may affect the government\u2019s ability to implement an effective, well-coordinated plan to manage Covid-19 situation in Malaysia.\n\u201cNevertheless, the continuing political uncertainties could further undermine the government\u2019s ability to implement a well-coordinated, carefully planned and effective response to the twin public health and economic crisis facing the country,\u201d he said.\nYeah noted that political instability is adding to public exasperation over the stubbornly high daily infection cases and mounting economic losses due to the second nation-wide lockdown.\n\u201cThe government at both federal and state levels is putting measures in a concerted effort to manage the pandemic.\nCommenting further on politics, he said the contestation for political power will continue to characterise Malaysia\u2019s politics for some time to come.", "news": "The Malaysian Reserve", "date": "2021-07-12 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "PPV volunteers should be fully vaccinated", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWFsYXlzaWFucmVzZXJ2ZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNy8xNC9wcHYtdm9sdW50ZWVycy1zaG91bGQtYmUtZnVsbHktdmFjY2luYXRlZC_SAVlodHRwczovL3RoZW1hbGF5c2lhbnJlc2VydmUuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvMTQvcHB2LXZvbHVudGVlcnMtc2hvdWxkLWJlLWZ1bGx5LXZhY2NpbmF0ZWQvYW1wLw?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://themalaysianreserve.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MITEC-PIKAS-Vaccine.jpg", "text": "by ASILA JALIL / pic by TMR FILE\n\nVOLUNTEERS and staff members at vaccination centres (PPVs) should be fully vaccinated before they are allowed to perform their duties at the centres.\n\nOsel group chief clinical and innovative scientist Dr Kris See said the Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) should only consider taking in fully vaccinated individuals as volunteers to reduce the symptoms and spread of the virus.\n\n\u201cI think at the fundamental level, CITF should ensure all volunteers are vaccinated completely with two doses.

As a result, many will not go the extra mile for patients because they are not motivated.\u201d\n\nThe specialist said there are many brilliant young doctors working with him but they do not know where they will be when their contracts expire.\n\nHe urged the government to quickly address the issue to ensure that the public health service can continue to provide the best care possible.", "keyword": ["specialist", "permanent", "mma", "positions", "opportunity", "doctor", "contract", "healthcare", "denies", "temporary", "specialists", "appointment", "doctors", "service", "public"], "summary": "The only way young doctors can achieve their goal of becoming specialists is to serve in public hospitals.\nHowever, if they are denied permanent positions, they lose that opportunity.\nThe doctor said there are now about 4,600 specialists in various disciplines serving in the public healthcare system.\nHe said if the government does not give existing contract doctors permanent positions, there will eventually be a shortage of specialists.\n\u201cI understand the frustrations many contract doctors are experiencing, because they do not know what their future holds.", "news": "The Sun Daily", "date": "2021-07-05 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Official MKN SOP For Phase 2 Of NRP As Of 23 July (In English)", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wNy8wNi9vZmZpY2lhbC1ta24tc29wLWZvci1waGFzZS0yLW9mLW5ycC1hcy1vZi01LWp1bHktaW4tZW5nbGlzaC_SAXdodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVyYWt5YXRwb3N0LmNvbS9uZXdzL21hbGF5c2lhLzIwMjEvMDcvMDYvb2ZmaWNpYWwtbWtuLXNvcC1mb3ItcGhhc2UtMi1vZi1ucnAtYXMtb2YtNS1qdWx5LWluLWVuZ2xpc2gvYW1wLw?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Azizul Rahman Ismail", "Maya Suraya"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SOP-Phase-2.jpeg", "text": "Subscribe to our new Telegram channel for the latest updates and stories.\n\nAfter the government announced that the National Recovery Plan (NRP) will be implemented state by state instead of nationwide and that 5 states will go into Phase 2 on July 5, new SOPs were released.\n\nRead More: Five States To Go Into Phase 2 on 5 July\n\nOn 7 July, Penang entered Phase 2.\n\nOn 9 July, Sabah entered Phase 2.\n\nOn 14 July Sarawak entered Phase 2.\n\nFor your convenience, TRP took the liberty of translating the latest Phase 2 standard operating procedures (SOP) released by the National Security Council (MKN) on 23 July.\n\nThe new Phase 2 SOP has some minor changes compared to the one released on 16 July.\n\nThe most notable changes are:\n\n60% of workers may return to the office.\n\nMost businesses may operate from 6 am to 10 pm.\n\nSports and recreational activities are allowed between 6 am and 10 pm.\n\nOutdoor filming is allowed.\n\nAccounting firms are allowed to open.\n\nWe marked all the differences in \u2018orange\u2018.\n\nAreas Involved\n\nKELANTAN, TERENGGANU, PAHANG, PERAK, PERLIS, PENANG, SABAH DAN SARAWAK.\n\n*For areas enforced by RMCO, the RMCO SOP in those areas is in force until the end of the RMCO.\n\nDuration\n\nEffective 5 July 2021 (12.01 am) \u2013 Kelantan, Terengganu, Pahang, Perak and Perlis.\n\nEffective 7 July 2021 (12.01 am) \u2013 Penang.\n\nEffective 9 July 2021 (12.01 am) \u2013 Sabah.

latest stories and updates.\n\nMalaysians have proven time and time again that they are worthy of international success in Cannes.\n\nFor some, making it to the Cannes commune figuratively or literally for a festival, award or even a holiday, is a marker of success for many.\n\nIn light of the recent news of the Cannes Film Festival returning after a year hiatus due to the Covid-19 pandemic, film buffs connoisseurs are anticipating a fresh breath of film talent across the globe.\n\nAlthough no Malaysian titles are showcased at the event this year, the city of Cannes on the French Riviera is still renowned for hosting other significant festivals and award shows like Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, and the Cannes Film Awards to name a couple.\n\nCannes Film Festival\n\nIn essence, the Cannes Film Festival is an annual film festival that previews new films of all genres, including documentaries from all around the world.\n\nAside from its main purpose, it is also a roll call for glitz, glam, networking, and parties.\n\nThat said, only a handful of Malaysians have graced this event and they are:\n\n1995: Film director U-Wei Haji Saari\u2019s film \u201cKaki Bakar\u201d (The Arsonist) was the first Malaysian production to be screened in the Un Certain Regard category. It is a take on William Faulkner\u2019s \u2018Barn Burnin\u2019 about the son of an itinerant worker who tries to prevent his volatile father from deliberately setting fires.\n\n2009: The second Malaysian to have been invited to the prestigious film festival is Chris Chong Chan Fui with his film \u201cKaraoke,\u201d which centres on a villagers way of life and the Malaysian palm oil industry. The film premiered in the Directors\u2019 Fortnight stream that year, an independent selection of the film festival.\n\n2010: Following in Karaoke\u2019s footsteps a year later at the Director\u2019s Fortnight is The Tiger Factory by Woo Ming Jin, a profoundly heartbreaking drama about \u201cbaby factories\u201d.\n\n2014: Malaysian documentary producer Indrani Kopal, a Fulbright scholar at the Hofstra University in New York at the time, was selected for her first production \u201cThe Game Changer\u201d. The documentary about Susan Slotnick, who uses dance as a form for rehabilitation for inmates at the Woodbourne Correctional Facility in New York, was shown at the Cannes Short Film Corner.\n\nCannes Film Awards\n\nMalaysians have also been making waves at the Cannes Film Awards. Not to be confused with the Cannes Film Festival, this international film festival celebrates film, filmmakers, producers, musicians, actors, screenwriters, photographers and the arts in general.\n\nThey aim to bring new names to the film industry and support new creators as well.\n\nRanked among the Top 100 most popular film festivals out of 10,000 festivals worldwide, the festival collaborates with experts in the field of European film art.\n\nIn its inaugural year this year, two Malaysians have each bagged an award at the Cannes Film Awards.\n\n\u201cTouch\u201d by Kurisu Lee, a 13-minute film about a young man and his dreams, won Best Asian Film in the Film Awards \u2013 Continental Category while \u201cGarbageman, Nurse, and Cop\u201d by Aiman Samat won Best Crime Film under the Film Awards \u2013 Additional Category.\n\nThe award show was held at the Cote d\u2019Azur Art Gallery in Cannes, France on 8 June.\n\nCannes Lions International Festival of Creativity\n\nFor the advertising and creative communications industry, winning a Cannes Lions is equivalent to being selected for the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nMalaysian agencies have in the past and are still currently winning large at this event.\n\nVJ Anand, former Executive Creative Director of advertising agency BBDO Malaysia and now Head of Creative of VaynerMedia in Singapore recalls the times Malaysia won big at Cannes Lions.\n\nMalaysia has always been pretty good at winning the global advertising stage and I\u2019m sure Malaysia will keep winning.\n\nHe remembers Southeast Asia\u2019s first and Malaysia\u2019s only Cannes Lions Grand Prix (the awards\u2019 most coveted honour) was in 2004 by JWT Malaysia for \u201cMissile Car\u201d, an imaginative guerrilla outdoor campaign to promote Channel Nine.\n\nSince, other creative agencies that have followed the shiny award trail include the following VJ has noted for us:\n\n2007: \u201cTang Hong Ming\u201d by Leo Burnett/Arc Worldwide Malaysia \u2013 a TV commercial by the acclaimed creative director and filmmaker Yasmin Ahmad. It was the first Malaysian TV commercial that ever won a Gold Cannes Lion and is still probably one of Malaysia\u2019s most memorable ads to date.\n\n2008: BBDO/Proximity Malaysia won Gold Lion for Chrysler Korea\u2019s campaign for Jeep in the Outdoor category.\n\n2015: When VJ was Group Executive Creative Director at TBWA\\Kuala Lumpur, they were awarded the Silver Lion for The Eveready Book of Play which was inspired by the traditional Malaysia form of storytelling, the Wayang Kulit (Shadow Play).\n\nMost recently this year, Grey Malaysia won Silver and Bronze Lion for WWF\u2019s Your Plastic Diet. And in association with the Cannes Lions, they also won the most coveted Grand Prix honour at the WARC Awards for Effectiveness for Tesco: Unforgettable Bag.\n\nThere have been many other Malaysians who have strutted away with a Cannes Lion, and for that we should be proud.\n\nREAD MORE: M\u2019sian filmmaker wins award at Cannes 2019 for incredible anti-bullying PSA", "keyword": ["cannes", "lion", "awards", "award", "international", "malaysians", "celebrating", "creative", "won", "festival", "lions", "malaysian"], "summary": "Malaysians have proven time and time again that they are worthy of international success in Cannes.\nCannes Film FestivalIn essence, the Cannes Film Festival is an annual film festival that previews new films of all genres, including documentaries from all around the world.\nIn its inaugural year this year, two Malaysians have each bagged an award at the Cannes Film Awards.\nCannes Lions International Festival of CreativityFor the advertising and creative communications industry, winning a Cannes Lions is equivalent to being selected for the Cannes Film Festival.\nThere have been many other Malaysians who have strutted away with a Cannes Lion, and for that we should be proud.", "news": "The Rakyat Post", "date": "2021-07-04 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "At least 17 killed in Philippines troop plane crash", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS93b3JsZC8yMDIxLzA3LzA0L2F0LWxlYXN0LTE3LWtpbGxlZC1pbi1waGlsaXBwaW5lcy10cm9vcC1wbGFuZS1jcmFzaC_SAQA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MashaMasha2022_1_800x500.jpg", "text": "MANILA: At least 17 people were killed when a Philippines Air Force plane carrying troops crashed on landing in the south of the country and broke up in flames today.\n\nThe Lockheed C-130 transport aircraft crashed at Patikul in Sulu province, in the far south of the archipelago nation where the army has been fighting a long war against Islamist militants from the Abu Sayyaf and other factions.\n\n\u201cSo far 40 wounded and injured were rescued and 17 bodies recovered.

There was hope that this all was going to be over soon.\n\nAs time went by, the rippling effect from the ban grew and that hope began to diminish. As restaurants and kitchens close or shut down, the economic ecosystem surrounding them feel the effect, and people begin to lose their income and their jobs.\n\nFrom the outside looking in, we see that some eateries pivot their businesses towards delivery. However, most food and beverage establishments in Malaysia are not built to fit the delivery model.\n\nEateries such as casual and fine dining restaurants depend on their ambience in addition to their menu. Additionally, not all foods and beverages such as soups and alcoholic drinks are favourable through delivery, and delivery services are costly which eats into the slim profit margins of these businesses and puts them in the red.\n\nThe united F&B joint statement\n\nZakaria Zayane / Unsplash\n\nBecause of the dire situation affecting F&B businesses and their supply chains, a coalition of five F&B associations held a press conference and released a joint statement addressing the matter.\n\nThey urge the Ministry of Health (MOH), National Security Council (MKN), Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP), and any related ministry to engage, discuss and debate with stakeholders (trade associations) for a solution.\n\nThe coalition believes by engaging with them, they could provide a wider perspective that could result in better policies and SOPs.\n\nWe are not asking for handouts, instead we need the government to be reasonable. The F&B industry has been a significantly small contributor to new clusters because many businesses have been compliant We appeal to Putrajaya, let our people come back to work, save small businesses and let us contribute to the nation again\n\nThe coalition is even prepared to help the government to deal with errant operators if their sector is allowed to reopen for dine-ins again.\n\nThe situation\n\nBased on a 2016 census done by The Department of Statistics, the coalition estimated that the move to not allow dine-ins has affected approximately 1 million Malaysians since 2020. This number does not include the farmers, fisheries, suppliers, distributors, and other businesses that depend on restaurants.\n\nThey said that many F&B operators have less than 2 months of cash flow left and are anticipating at least a 60% closure rate if the ban continues.\n\nAn intervention\n\nRowan Freeman / Unsplash\n\nThe coalition also urged the government to scrap the Essential and Non-Essential industry labels as a first step to finding a better solution.\n\nThey also ask that the government engage, and regulate the 2 largest food delivery platforms, as long as dining-in is not allowed.\n\nThe coalition requests a rebate of 15% on the food delivery commission rates from now till Jan 2022.\n\nThe reduction in commission rates can be made up from the influx of users and orders. At the same time, ensure the welfare of the riders is guarded. The review to lower our commission rates should not affect the rider\u2019s abilities to earn a living.\n\nAccording to the coalition, the 2 largest food delivery services charge 30% or more in commissions. This was accepted by most F&B businesses because delivery was seen as marketing and promotion while dine-in and takeaway are the main income.\n\nHowever, when dine-ins are not allowed the 30% commission not only cuts into profit but in a lot of cases make each sale a loss unless prices are increased accordingly.\n\nAt the ready\n\nThe members of the coalition also offer the mobilisation of their social media to help drive vaccination registration numbers, increase vaccine literacy, counter vaccine hesitancy, and reward vaccinated individuals.\n\nIn return, they urge Putrajaya to be transparent and accountable on the expected vaccine arrival timelines so that businesses can plan ahead.\n\nMeanwhile, the coalition of F&B businesses is also being proactive about their situation and is formulating a plan to help both the industry and those in need as well.

The approach to managing both the pandemic and its human consequences have been the same since March last year,\u201d Nungsari said.\n\nMeanwhile, Universiti Putra Malaysia political scientist Prof Dr Jayum Jawan said the effort to address the pandemic and the crippling of the economy and lives should not be confused and conflated with one another.\n\n\u201cThe government at both federal and state levels is putting measures in a concerted effort to manage the pandemic.

So, when the 2018 general election produced no clear majority to any group or political party, the situation becomes vulnerable and the jockeying for power becomes highly tense,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that this volatile period is also aggravated by the fact that some politicians are not ashamed to \u201cjump ship\u201d, and ruling parties or coalitions are also known in the past to have enticed members of legislature from other parties in order to secure a comfortable legislative support.", "keyword": ["wellcoordinated", "instability", "governments", "manage", "effort", "response", "affect", "parties", "majority", "covid", "power", "pandemic", "nungsari", "political"], "summary": "Key industrial hubs such as the Klang Valley and Selangor are still unable to flatten the curveby HARIZAH KAMEL / pic by TMR FILETHE current political instability may affect the government\u2019s ability to implement an effective, well-coordinated plan to manage Covid-19 situation in Malaysia.\n\u201cNevertheless, the continuing political uncertainties could further undermine the government\u2019s ability to implement a well-coordinated, carefully planned and effective response to the twin public health and economic crisis facing the country,\u201d he said.\nYeah noted that political instability is adding to public exasperation over the stubbornly high daily infection cases and mounting economic losses due to the second nation-wide lockdown.\n\u201cThe government at both federal and state levels is putting measures in a concerted effort to manage the pandemic.\nCommenting further on politics, he said the contestation for political power will continue to characterise Malaysia\u2019s politics for some time to come.", "news": "The Malaysian Reserve", "date": "2021-07-12 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "PPV volunteers should be fully vaccinated", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWFsYXlzaWFucmVzZXJ2ZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNy8xNC9wcHYtdm9sdW50ZWVycy1zaG91bGQtYmUtZnVsbHktdmFjY2luYXRlZC_SAVlodHRwczovL3RoZW1hbGF5c2lhbnJlc2VydmUuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvMTQvcHB2LXZvbHVudGVlcnMtc2hvdWxkLWJlLWZ1bGx5LXZhY2NpbmF0ZWQvYW1wLw?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://themalaysianreserve.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MITEC-PIKAS-Vaccine.jpg", "text": "by ASILA JALIL / pic by TMR FILE\n\nVOLUNTEERS and staff members at vaccination centres (PPVs) should be fully vaccinated before they are allowed to perform their duties at the centres.\n\nOsel group chief clinical and innovative scientist Dr Kris See said the Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) should only consider taking in fully vaccinated individuals as volunteers to reduce the symptoms and spread of the virus.\n\n\u201cI think at the fundamental level, CITF should ensure all volunteers are vaccinated completely with two doses.

As a result, many will not go the extra mile for patients because they are not motivated.\u201d\n\nThe specialist said there are many brilliant young doctors working with him but they do not know where they will be when their contracts expire.\n\nHe urged the government to quickly address the issue to ensure that the public health service can continue to provide the best care possible.", "keyword": ["specialist", "permanent", "mma", "positions", "opportunity", "doctor", "contract", "healthcare", "denies", "temporary", "specialists", "appointment", "doctors", "service", "public"], "summary": "The only way young doctors can achieve their goal of becoming specialists is to serve in public hospitals.\nHowever, if they are denied permanent positions, they lose that opportunity.\nThe doctor said there are now about 4,600 specialists in various disciplines serving in the public healthcare system.\nHe said if the government does not give existing contract doctors permanent positions, there will eventually be a shortage of specialists.\n\u201cI understand the frustrations many contract doctors are experiencing, because they do not know what their future holds.", "news": "The Sun Daily", "date": "2021-07-05 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Official MKN SOP For Phase 2 Of NRP As Of 23 July (In English)", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wNy8wNi9vZmZpY2lhbC1ta24tc29wLWZvci1waGFzZS0yLW9mLW5ycC1hcy1vZi01LWp1bHktaW4tZW5nbGlzaC_SAXdodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVyYWt5YXRwb3N0LmNvbS9uZXdzL21hbGF5c2lhLzIwMjEvMDcvMDYvb2ZmaWNpYWwtbWtuLXNvcC1mb3ItcGhhc2UtMi1vZi1ucnAtYXMtb2YtNS1qdWx5LWluLWVuZ2xpc2gvYW1wLw?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Azizul Rahman Ismail", "Maya Suraya"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SOP-Phase-2.jpeg", "text": "Subscribe to our new Telegram channel for the latest updates and stories.\n\nAfter the government announced that the National Recovery Plan (NRP) will be implemented state by state instead of nationwide and that 5 states will go into Phase 2 on July 5, new SOPs were released.\n\nRead More: Five States To Go Into Phase 2 on 5 July\n\nOn 7 July, Penang entered Phase 2.\n\nOn 9 July, Sabah entered Phase 2.\n\nOn 14 July Sarawak entered Phase 2.\n\nFor your convenience, TRP took the liberty of translating the latest Phase 2 standard operating procedures (SOP) released by the National Security Council (MKN) on 23 July.\n\nThe new Phase 2 SOP has some minor changes compared to the one released on 16 July.\n\nThe most notable changes are:\n\n60% of workers may return to the office.\n\nMost businesses may operate from 6 am to 10 pm.\n\nSports and recreational activities are allowed between 6 am and 10 pm.\n\nOutdoor filming is allowed.\n\nAccounting firms are allowed to open.\n\nWe marked all the differences in \u2018orange\u2018.\n\nAreas Involved\n\nKELANTAN, TERENGGANU, PAHANG, PERAK, PERLIS, PENANG, SABAH DAN SARAWAK.\n\n*For areas enforced by RMCO, the RMCO SOP in those areas is in force until the end of the RMCO.\n\nDuration\n\nEffective 5 July 2021 (12.01 am) \u2013 Kelantan, Terengganu, Pahang, Perak and Perlis.\n\nEffective 7 July 2021 (12.01 am) \u2013 Penang.\n\nEffective 9 July 2021 (12.01 am) \u2013 Sabah.

latest stories and updates.\n\nMalaysians have proven time and time again that they are worthy of international success in Cannes.\n\nFor some, making it to the Cannes commune figuratively or literally for a festival, award or even a holiday, is a marker of success for many.\n\nIn light of the recent news of the Cannes Film Festival returning after a year hiatus due to the Covid-19 pandemic, film buffs connoisseurs are anticipating a fresh breath of film talent across the globe.\n\nAlthough no Malaysian titles are showcased at the event this year, the city of Cannes on the French Riviera is still renowned for hosting other significant festivals and award shows like Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, and the Cannes Film Awards to name a couple.\n\nCannes Film Festival\n\nIn essence, the Cannes Film Festival is an annual film festival that previews new films of all genres, including documentaries from all around the world.\n\nAside from its main purpose, it is also a roll call for glitz, glam, networking, and parties.\n\nThat said, only a handful of Malaysians have graced this event and they are:\n\n1995: Film director U-Wei Haji Saari\u2019s film \u201cKaki Bakar\u201d (The Arsonist) was the first Malaysian production to be screened in the Un Certain Regard category. It is a take on William Faulkner\u2019s \u2018Barn Burnin\u2019 about the son of an itinerant worker who tries to prevent his volatile father from deliberately setting fires.\n\n2009: The second Malaysian to have been invited to the prestigious film festival is Chris Chong Chan Fui with his film \u201cKaraoke,\u201d which centres on a villagers way of life and the Malaysian palm oil industry. The film premiered in the Directors\u2019 Fortnight stream that year, an independent selection of the film festival.\n\n2010: Following in Karaoke\u2019s footsteps a year later at the Director\u2019s Fortnight is The Tiger Factory by Woo Ming Jin, a profoundly heartbreaking drama about \u201cbaby factories\u201d.\n\n2014: Malaysian documentary producer Indrani Kopal, a Fulbright scholar at the Hofstra University in New York at the time, was selected for her first production \u201cThe Game Changer\u201d. The documentary about Susan Slotnick, who uses dance as a form for rehabilitation for inmates at the Woodbourne Correctional Facility in New York, was shown at the Cannes Short Film Corner.\n\nCannes Film Awards\n\nMalaysians have also been making waves at the Cannes Film Awards. Not to be confused with the Cannes Film Festival, this international film festival celebrates film, filmmakers, producers, musicians, actors, screenwriters, photographers and the arts in general.\n\nThey aim to bring new names to the film industry and support new creators as well.\n\nRanked among the Top 100 most popular film festivals out of 10,000 festivals worldwide, the festival collaborates with experts in the field of European film art.\n\nIn its inaugural year this year, two Malaysians have each bagged an award at the Cannes Film Awards.\n\n\u201cTouch\u201d by Kurisu Lee, a 13-minute film about a young man and his dreams, won Best Asian Film in the Film Awards \u2013 Continental Category while \u201cGarbageman, Nurse, and Cop\u201d by Aiman Samat won Best Crime Film under the Film Awards \u2013 Additional Category.\n\nThe award show was held at the Cote d\u2019Azur Art Gallery in Cannes, France on 8 June.\n\nCannes Lions International Festival of Creativity\n\nFor the advertising and creative communications industry, winning a Cannes Lions is equivalent to being selected for the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nMalaysian agencies have in the past and are still currently winning large at this event.\n\nVJ Anand, former Executive Creative Director of advertising agency BBDO Malaysia and now Head of Creative of VaynerMedia in Singapore recalls the times Malaysia won big at Cannes Lions.\n\nMalaysia has always been pretty good at winning the global advertising stage and I\u2019m sure Malaysia will keep winning.\n\nHe remembers Southeast Asia\u2019s first and Malaysia\u2019s only Cannes Lions Grand Prix (the awards\u2019 most coveted honour) was in 2004 by JWT Malaysia for \u201cMissile Car\u201d, an imaginative guerrilla outdoor campaign to promote Channel Nine.\n\nSince, other creative agencies that have followed the shiny award trail include the following VJ has noted for us:\n\n2007: \u201cTang Hong Ming\u201d by Leo Burnett/Arc Worldwide Malaysia \u2013 a TV commercial by the acclaimed creative director and filmmaker Yasmin Ahmad. It was the first Malaysian TV commercial that ever won a Gold Cannes Lion and is still probably one of Malaysia\u2019s most memorable ads to date.\n\n2008: BBDO/Proximity Malaysia won Gold Lion for Chrysler Korea\u2019s campaign for Jeep in the Outdoor category.\n\n2015: When VJ was Group Executive Creative Director at TBWA\\Kuala Lumpur, they were awarded the Silver Lion for The Eveready Book of Play which was inspired by the traditional Malaysia form of storytelling, the Wayang Kulit (Shadow Play).\n\nMost recently this year, Grey Malaysia won Silver and Bronze Lion for WWF\u2019s Your Plastic Diet. And in association with the Cannes Lions, they also won the most coveted Grand Prix honour at the WARC Awards for Effectiveness for Tesco: Unforgettable Bag.\n\nThere have been many other Malaysians who have strutted away with a Cannes Lion, and for that we should be proud.\n\nREAD MORE: M\u2019sian filmmaker wins award at Cannes 2019 for incredible anti-bullying PSA", "keyword": ["cannes", "lion", "awards", "award", "international", "malaysians", "celebrating", "creative", "won", "festival", "lions", "malaysian"], "summary": "Malaysians have proven time and time again that they are worthy of international success in Cannes.\nCannes Film FestivalIn essence, the Cannes Film Festival is an annual film festival that previews new films of all genres, including documentaries from all around the world.\nIn its inaugural year this year, two Malaysians have each bagged an award at the Cannes Film Awards.\nCannes Lions International Festival of CreativityFor the advertising and creative communications industry, winning a Cannes Lions is equivalent to being selected for the Cannes Film Festival.\nThere have been many other Malaysians who have strutted away with a Cannes Lion, and for that we should be proud.", "news": "The Rakyat Post", "date": "2021-07-04 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "At least 17 killed in Philippines troop plane crash", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS93b3JsZC8yMDIxLzA3LzA0L2F0LWxlYXN0LTE3LWtpbGxlZC1pbi1waGlsaXBwaW5lcy10cm9vcC1wbGFuZS1jcmFzaC_SAQA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MashaMasha2022_1_800x500.jpg", "text": "MANILA: At least 17 people were killed when a Philippines Air Force plane carrying troops crashed on landing in the south of the country and broke up in flames today.\n\nThe Lockheed C-130 transport aircraft crashed at Patikul in Sulu province, in the far south of the archipelago nation where the army has been fighting a long war against Islamist militants from the Abu Sayyaf and other factions.\n\n\u201cSo far 40 wounded and injured were rescued and 17 bodies recovered.

There was hope that this all was going to be over soon.\n\nAs time went by, the rippling effect from the ban grew and that hope began to diminish. As restaurants and kitchens close or shut down, the economic ecosystem surrounding them feel the effect, and people begin to lose their income and their jobs.\n\nFrom the outside looking in, we see that some eateries pivot their businesses towards delivery. However, most food and beverage establishments in Malaysia are not built to fit the delivery model.\n\nEateries such as casual and fine dining restaurants depend on their ambience in addition to their menu. Additionally, not all foods and beverages such as soups and alcoholic drinks are favourable through delivery, and delivery services are costly which eats into the slim profit margins of these businesses and puts them in the red.\n\nThe united F&B joint statement\n\nZakaria Zayane / Unsplash\n\nBecause of the dire situation affecting F&B businesses and their supply chains, a coalition of five F&B associations held a press conference and released a joint statement addressing the matter.\n\nThey urge the Ministry of Health (MOH), National Security Council (MKN), Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP), and any related ministry to engage, discuss and debate with stakeholders (trade associations) for a solution.\n\nThe coalition believes by engaging with them, they could provide a wider perspective that could result in better policies and SOPs.\n\nWe are not asking for handouts, instead we need the government to be reasonable. The F&B industry has been a significantly small contributor to new clusters because many businesses have been compliant We appeal to Putrajaya, let our people come back to work, save small businesses and let us contribute to the nation again\n\nThe coalition is even prepared to help the government to deal with errant operators if their sector is allowed to reopen for dine-ins again.\n\nThe situation\n\nBased on a 2016 census done by The Department of Statistics, the coalition estimated that the move to not allow dine-ins has affected approximately 1 million Malaysians since 2020. This number does not include the farmers, fisheries, suppliers, distributors, and other businesses that depend on restaurants.\n\nThey said that many F&B operators have less than 2 months of cash flow left and are anticipating at least a 60% closure rate if the ban continues.\n\nAn intervention\n\nRowan Freeman / Unsplash\n\nThe coalition also urged the government to scrap the Essential and Non-Essential industry labels as a first step to finding a better solution.\n\nThey also ask that the government engage, and regulate the 2 largest food delivery platforms, as long as dining-in is not allowed.\n\nThe coalition requests a rebate of 15% on the food delivery commission rates from now till Jan 2022.\n\nThe reduction in commission rates can be made up from the influx of users and orders. At the same time, ensure the welfare of the riders is guarded. The review to lower our commission rates should not affect the rider\u2019s abilities to earn a living.\n\nAccording to the coalition, the 2 largest food delivery services charge 30% or more in commissions. This was accepted by most F&B businesses because delivery was seen as marketing and promotion while dine-in and takeaway are the main income.\n\nHowever, when dine-ins are not allowed the 30% commission not only cuts into profit but in a lot of cases make each sale a loss unless prices are increased accordingly.\n\nAt the ready\n\nThe members of the coalition also offer the mobilisation of their social media to help drive vaccination registration numbers, increase vaccine literacy, counter vaccine hesitancy, and reward vaccinated individuals.\n\nIn return, they urge Putrajaya to be transparent and accountable on the expected vaccine arrival timelines so that businesses can plan ahead.\n\nMeanwhile, the coalition of F&B businesses is also being proactive about their situation and is formulating a plan to help both the industry and those in need as well.

The approach to managing both the pandemic and its human consequences have been the same since March last year,\u201d Nungsari said.\n\nMeanwhile, Universiti Putra Malaysia political scientist Prof Dr Jayum Jawan said the effort to address the pandemic and the crippling of the economy and lives should not be confused and conflated with one another.\n\n\u201cThe government at both federal and state levels is putting measures in a concerted effort to manage the pandemic.

So, when the 2018 general election produced no clear majority to any group or political party, the situation becomes vulnerable and the jockeying for power becomes highly tense,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that this volatile period is also aggravated by the fact that some politicians are not ashamed to \u201cjump ship\u201d, and ruling parties or coalitions are also known in the past to have enticed members of legislature from other parties in order to secure a comfortable legislative support.", "keyword": ["wellcoordinated", "instability", "governments", "manage", "effort", "response", "affect", "parties", "majority", "covid", "power", "pandemic", "nungsari", "political"], "summary": "Key industrial hubs such as the Klang Valley and Selangor are still unable to flatten the curveby HARIZAH KAMEL / pic by TMR FILETHE current political instability may affect the government\u2019s ability to implement an effective, well-coordinated plan to manage Covid-19 situation in Malaysia.\n\u201cNevertheless, the continuing political uncertainties could further undermine the government\u2019s ability to implement a well-coordinated, carefully planned and effective response to the twin public health and economic crisis facing the country,\u201d he said.\nYeah noted that political instability is adding to public exasperation over the stubbornly high daily infection cases and mounting economic losses due to the second nation-wide lockdown.\n\u201cThe government at both federal and state levels is putting measures in a concerted effort to manage the pandemic.\nCommenting further on politics, he said the contestation for political power will continue to characterise Malaysia\u2019s politics for some time to come.", "news": "The Malaysian Reserve", "date": "2021-07-12 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "PPV volunteers should be fully vaccinated", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWFsYXlzaWFucmVzZXJ2ZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNy8xNC9wcHYtdm9sdW50ZWVycy1zaG91bGQtYmUtZnVsbHktdmFjY2luYXRlZC_SAVlodHRwczovL3RoZW1hbGF5c2lhbnJlc2VydmUuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvMTQvcHB2LXZvbHVudGVlcnMtc2hvdWxkLWJlLWZ1bGx5LXZhY2NpbmF0ZWQvYW1wLw?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://themalaysianreserve.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MITEC-PIKAS-Vaccine.jpg", "text": "by ASILA JALIL / pic by TMR FILE\n\nVOLUNTEERS and staff members at vaccination centres (PPVs) should be fully vaccinated before they are allowed to perform their duties at the centres.\n\nOsel group chief clinical and innovative scientist Dr Kris See said the Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) should only consider taking in fully vaccinated individuals as volunteers to reduce the symptoms and spread of the virus.\n\n\u201cI think at the fundamental level, CITF should ensure all volunteers are vaccinated completely with two doses.

As a result, many will not go the extra mile for patients because they are not motivated.\u201d\n\nThe specialist said there are many brilliant young doctors working with him but they do not know where they will be when their contracts expire.\n\nHe urged the government to quickly address the issue to ensure that the public health service can continue to provide the best care possible.", "keyword": ["specialist", "permanent", "mma", "positions", "opportunity", "doctor", "contract", "healthcare", "denies", "temporary", "specialists", "appointment", "doctors", "service", "public"], "summary": "The only way young doctors can achieve their goal of becoming specialists is to serve in public hospitals.\nHowever, if they are denied permanent positions, they lose that opportunity.\nThe doctor said there are now about 4,600 specialists in various disciplines serving in the public healthcare system.\nHe said if the government does not give existing contract doctors permanent positions, there will eventually be a shortage of specialists.\n\u201cI understand the frustrations many contract doctors are experiencing, because they do not know what their future holds.", "news": "The Sun Daily", "date": "2021-07-05 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Official MKN SOP For Phase 2 Of NRP As Of 23 July (In English)", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wNy8wNi9vZmZpY2lhbC1ta24tc29wLWZvci1waGFzZS0yLW9mLW5ycC1hcy1vZi01LWp1bHktaW4tZW5nbGlzaC_SAXdodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVyYWt5YXRwb3N0LmNvbS9uZXdzL21hbGF5c2lhLzIwMjEvMDcvMDYvb2ZmaWNpYWwtbWtuLXNvcC1mb3ItcGhhc2UtMi1vZi1ucnAtYXMtb2YtNS1qdWx5LWluLWVuZ2xpc2gvYW1wLw?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Azizul Rahman Ismail", "Maya Suraya"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SOP-Phase-2.jpeg", "text": "Subscribe to our new Telegram channel for the latest updates and stories.\n\nAfter the government announced that the National Recovery Plan (NRP) will be implemented state by state instead of nationwide and that 5 states will go into Phase 2 on July 5, new SOPs were released.\n\nRead More: Five States To Go Into Phase 2 on 5 July\n\nOn 7 July, Penang entered Phase 2.\n\nOn 9 July, Sabah entered Phase 2.\n\nOn 14 July Sarawak entered Phase 2.\n\nFor your convenience, TRP took the liberty of translating the latest Phase 2 standard operating procedures (SOP) released by the National Security Council (MKN) on 23 July.\n\nThe new Phase 2 SOP has some minor changes compared to the one released on 16 July.\n\nThe most notable changes are:\n\n60% of workers may return to the office.\n\nMost businesses may operate from 6 am to 10 pm.\n\nSports and recreational activities are allowed between 6 am and 10 pm.\n\nOutdoor filming is allowed.\n\nAccounting firms are allowed to open.\n\nWe marked all the differences in \u2018orange\u2018.\n\nAreas Involved\n\nKELANTAN, TERENGGANU, PAHANG, PERAK, PERLIS, PENANG, SABAH DAN SARAWAK.\n\n*For areas enforced by RMCO, the RMCO SOP in those areas is in force until the end of the RMCO.\n\nDuration\n\nEffective 5 July 2021 (12.01 am) \u2013 Kelantan, Terengganu, Pahang, Perak and Perlis.\n\nEffective 7 July 2021 (12.01 am) \u2013 Penang.\n\nEffective 9 July 2021 (12.01 am) \u2013 Sabah.

latest stories and updates.\n\nMalaysians have proven time and time again that they are worthy of international success in Cannes.\n\nFor some, making it to the Cannes commune figuratively or literally for a festival, award or even a holiday, is a marker of success for many.\n\nIn light of the recent news of the Cannes Film Festival returning after a year hiatus due to the Covid-19 pandemic, film buffs connoisseurs are anticipating a fresh breath of film talent across the globe.\n\nAlthough no Malaysian titles are showcased at the event this year, the city of Cannes on the French Riviera is still renowned for hosting other significant festivals and award shows like Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, and the Cannes Film Awards to name a couple.\n\nCannes Film Festival\n\nIn essence, the Cannes Film Festival is an annual film festival that previews new films of all genres, including documentaries from all around the world.\n\nAside from its main purpose, it is also a roll call for glitz, glam, networking, and parties.\n\nThat said, only a handful of Malaysians have graced this event and they are:\n\n1995: Film director U-Wei Haji Saari\u2019s film \u201cKaki Bakar\u201d (The Arsonist) was the first Malaysian production to be screened in the Un Certain Regard category. It is a take on William Faulkner\u2019s \u2018Barn Burnin\u2019 about the son of an itinerant worker who tries to prevent his volatile father from deliberately setting fires.\n\n2009: The second Malaysian to have been invited to the prestigious film festival is Chris Chong Chan Fui with his film \u201cKaraoke,\u201d which centres on a villagers way of life and the Malaysian palm oil industry. The film premiered in the Directors\u2019 Fortnight stream that year, an independent selection of the film festival.\n\n2010: Following in Karaoke\u2019s footsteps a year later at the Director\u2019s Fortnight is The Tiger Factory by Woo Ming Jin, a profoundly heartbreaking drama about \u201cbaby factories\u201d.\n\n2014: Malaysian documentary producer Indrani Kopal, a Fulbright scholar at the Hofstra University in New York at the time, was selected for her first production \u201cThe Game Changer\u201d. The documentary about Susan Slotnick, who uses dance as a form for rehabilitation for inmates at the Woodbourne Correctional Facility in New York, was shown at the Cannes Short Film Corner.\n\nCannes Film Awards\n\nMalaysians have also been making waves at the Cannes Film Awards. Not to be confused with the Cannes Film Festival, this international film festival celebrates film, filmmakers, producers, musicians, actors, screenwriters, photographers and the arts in general.\n\nThey aim to bring new names to the film industry and support new creators as well.\n\nRanked among the Top 100 most popular film festivals out of 10,000 festivals worldwide, the festival collaborates with experts in the field of European film art.\n\nIn its inaugural year this year, two Malaysians have each bagged an award at the Cannes Film Awards.\n\n\u201cTouch\u201d by Kurisu Lee, a 13-minute film about a young man and his dreams, won Best Asian Film in the Film Awards \u2013 Continental Category while \u201cGarbageman, Nurse, and Cop\u201d by Aiman Samat won Best Crime Film under the Film Awards \u2013 Additional Category.\n\nThe award show was held at the Cote d\u2019Azur Art Gallery in Cannes, France on 8 June.\n\nCannes Lions International Festival of Creativity\n\nFor the advertising and creative communications industry, winning a Cannes Lions is equivalent to being selected for the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nMalaysian agencies have in the past and are still currently winning large at this event.\n\nVJ Anand, former Executive Creative Director of advertising agency BBDO Malaysia and now Head of Creative of VaynerMedia in Singapore recalls the times Malaysia won big at Cannes Lions.\n\nMalaysia has always been pretty good at winning the global advertising stage and I\u2019m sure Malaysia will keep winning.\n\nHe remembers Southeast Asia\u2019s first and Malaysia\u2019s only Cannes Lions Grand Prix (the awards\u2019 most coveted honour) was in 2004 by JWT Malaysia for \u201cMissile Car\u201d, an imaginative guerrilla outdoor campaign to promote Channel Nine.\n\nSince, other creative agencies that have followed the shiny award trail include the following VJ has noted for us:\n\n2007: \u201cTang Hong Ming\u201d by Leo Burnett/Arc Worldwide Malaysia \u2013 a TV commercial by the acclaimed creative director and filmmaker Yasmin Ahmad. It was the first Malaysian TV commercial that ever won a Gold Cannes Lion and is still probably one of Malaysia\u2019s most memorable ads to date.\n\n2008: BBDO/Proximity Malaysia won Gold Lion for Chrysler Korea\u2019s campaign for Jeep in the Outdoor category.\n\n2015: When VJ was Group Executive Creative Director at TBWA\\Kuala Lumpur, they were awarded the Silver Lion for The Eveready Book of Play which was inspired by the traditional Malaysia form of storytelling, the Wayang Kulit (Shadow Play).\n\nMost recently this year, Grey Malaysia won Silver and Bronze Lion for WWF\u2019s Your Plastic Diet. And in association with the Cannes Lions, they also won the most coveted Grand Prix honour at the WARC Awards for Effectiveness for Tesco: Unforgettable Bag.\n\nThere have been many other Malaysians who have strutted away with a Cannes Lion, and for that we should be proud.\n\nREAD MORE: M\u2019sian filmmaker wins award at Cannes 2019 for incredible anti-bullying PSA", "keyword": ["cannes", "lion", "awards", "award", "international", "malaysians", "celebrating", "creative", "won", "festival", "lions", "malaysian"], "summary": "Malaysians have proven time and time again that they are worthy of international success in Cannes.\nCannes Film FestivalIn essence, the Cannes Film Festival is an annual film festival that previews new films of all genres, including documentaries from all around the world.\nIn its inaugural year this year, two Malaysians have each bagged an award at the Cannes Film Awards.\nCannes Lions International Festival of CreativityFor the advertising and creative communications industry, winning a Cannes Lions is equivalent to being selected for the Cannes Film Festival.\nThere have been many other Malaysians who have strutted away with a Cannes Lion, and for that we should be proud.", "news": "The Rakyat Post", "date": "2021-07-04 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "At least 17 killed in Philippines troop plane crash", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS93b3JsZC8yMDIxLzA3LzA0L2F0LWxlYXN0LTE3LWtpbGxlZC1pbi1waGlsaXBwaW5lcy10cm9vcC1wbGFuZS1jcmFzaC_SAQA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MashaMasha2022_1_800x500.jpg", "text": "MANILA: At least 17 people were killed when a Philippines Air Force plane carrying troops crashed on landing in the south of the country and broke up in flames today.\n\nThe Lockheed C-130 transport aircraft crashed at Patikul in Sulu province, in the far south of the archipelago nation where the army has been fighting a long war against Islamist militants from the Abu Sayyaf and other factions.\n\n\u201cSo far 40 wounded and injured were rescued and 17 bodies recovered.

There was hope that this all was going to be over soon.\n\nAs time went by, the rippling effect from the ban grew and that hope began to diminish. As restaurants and kitchens close or shut down, the economic ecosystem surrounding them feel the effect, and people begin to lose their income and their jobs.\n\nFrom the outside looking in, we see that some eateries pivot their businesses towards delivery. However, most food and beverage establishments in Malaysia are not built to fit the delivery model.\n\nEateries such as casual and fine dining restaurants depend on their ambience in addition to their menu. Additionally, not all foods and beverages such as soups and alcoholic drinks are favourable through delivery, and delivery services are costly which eats into the slim profit margins of these businesses and puts them in the red.\n\nThe united F&B joint statement\n\nZakaria Zayane / Unsplash\n\nBecause of the dire situation affecting F&B businesses and their supply chains, a coalition of five F&B associations held a press conference and released a joint statement addressing the matter.\n\nThey urge the Ministry of Health (MOH), National Security Council (MKN), Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP), and any related ministry to engage, discuss and debate with stakeholders (trade associations) for a solution.\n\nThe coalition believes by engaging with them, they could provide a wider perspective that could result in better policies and SOPs.\n\nWe are not asking for handouts, instead we need the government to be reasonable. The F&B industry has been a significantly small contributor to new clusters because many businesses have been compliant We appeal to Putrajaya, let our people come back to work, save small businesses and let us contribute to the nation again\n\nThe coalition is even prepared to help the government to deal with errant operators if their sector is allowed to reopen for dine-ins again.\n\nThe situation\n\nBased on a 2016 census done by The Department of Statistics, the coalition estimated that the move to not allow dine-ins has affected approximately 1 million Malaysians since 2020. This number does not include the farmers, fisheries, suppliers, distributors, and other businesses that depend on restaurants.\n\nThey said that many F&B operators have less than 2 months of cash flow left and are anticipating at least a 60% closure rate if the ban continues.\n\nAn intervention\n\nRowan Freeman / Unsplash\n\nThe coalition also urged the government to scrap the Essential and Non-Essential industry labels as a first step to finding a better solution.\n\nThey also ask that the government engage, and regulate the 2 largest food delivery platforms, as long as dining-in is not allowed.\n\nThe coalition requests a rebate of 15% on the food delivery commission rates from now till Jan 2022.\n\nThe reduction in commission rates can be made up from the influx of users and orders. At the same time, ensure the welfare of the riders is guarded. The review to lower our commission rates should not affect the rider\u2019s abilities to earn a living.\n\nAccording to the coalition, the 2 largest food delivery services charge 30% or more in commissions. This was accepted by most F&B businesses because delivery was seen as marketing and promotion while dine-in and takeaway are the main income.\n\nHowever, when dine-ins are not allowed the 30% commission not only cuts into profit but in a lot of cases make each sale a loss unless prices are increased accordingly.\n\nAt the ready\n\nThe members of the coalition also offer the mobilisation of their social media to help drive vaccination registration numbers, increase vaccine literacy, counter vaccine hesitancy, and reward vaccinated individuals.\n\nIn return, they urge Putrajaya to be transparent and accountable on the expected vaccine arrival timelines so that businesses can plan ahead.\n\nMeanwhile, the coalition of F&B businesses is also being proactive about their situation and is formulating a plan to help both the industry and those in need as well.

The approach to managing both the pandemic and its human consequences have been the same since March last year,\u201d Nungsari said.\n\nMeanwhile, Universiti Putra Malaysia political scientist Prof Dr Jayum Jawan said the effort to address the pandemic and the crippling of the economy and lives should not be confused and conflated with one another.\n\n\u201cThe government at both federal and state levels is putting measures in a concerted effort to manage the pandemic.

So, when the 2018 general election produced no clear majority to any group or political party, the situation becomes vulnerable and the jockeying for power becomes highly tense,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that this volatile period is also aggravated by the fact that some politicians are not ashamed to \u201cjump ship\u201d, and ruling parties or coalitions are also known in the past to have enticed members of legislature from other parties in order to secure a comfortable legislative support.", "keyword": ["wellcoordinated", "instability", "governments", "manage", "effort", "response", "affect", "parties", "majority", "covid", "power", "pandemic", "nungsari", "political"], "summary": "Key industrial hubs such as the Klang Valley and Selangor are still unable to flatten the curveby HARIZAH KAMEL / pic by TMR FILETHE current political instability may affect the government\u2019s ability to implement an effective, well-coordinated plan to manage Covid-19 situation in Malaysia.\n\u201cNevertheless, the continuing political uncertainties could further undermine the government\u2019s ability to implement a well-coordinated, carefully planned and effective response to the twin public health and economic crisis facing the country,\u201d he said.\nYeah noted that political instability is adding to public exasperation over the stubbornly high daily infection cases and mounting economic losses due to the second nation-wide lockdown.\n\u201cThe government at both federal and state levels is putting measures in a concerted effort to manage the pandemic.\nCommenting further on politics, he said the contestation for political power will continue to characterise Malaysia\u2019s politics for some time to come.", "news": "The Malaysian Reserve", "date": "2021-07-12 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "PPV volunteers should be fully vaccinated", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWFsYXlzaWFucmVzZXJ2ZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNy8xNC9wcHYtdm9sdW50ZWVycy1zaG91bGQtYmUtZnVsbHktdmFjY2luYXRlZC_SAVlodHRwczovL3RoZW1hbGF5c2lhbnJlc2VydmUuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvMTQvcHB2LXZvbHVudGVlcnMtc2hvdWxkLWJlLWZ1bGx5LXZhY2NpbmF0ZWQvYW1wLw?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://themalaysianreserve.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MITEC-PIKAS-Vaccine.jpg", "text": "by ASILA JALIL / pic by TMR FILE\n\nVOLUNTEERS and staff members at vaccination centres (PPVs) should be fully vaccinated before they are allowed to perform their duties at the centres.\n\nOsel group chief clinical and innovative scientist Dr Kris See said the Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) should only consider taking in fully vaccinated individuals as volunteers to reduce the symptoms and spread of the virus.\n\n\u201cI think at the fundamental level, CITF should ensure all volunteers are vaccinated completely with two doses.

As a result, many will not go the extra mile for patients because they are not motivated.\u201d\n\nThe specialist said there are many brilliant young doctors working with him but they do not know where they will be when their contracts expire.\n\nHe urged the government to quickly address the issue to ensure that the public health service can continue to provide the best care possible.", "keyword": ["specialist", "permanent", "mma", "positions", "opportunity", "doctor", "contract", "healthcare", "denies", "temporary", "specialists", "appointment", "doctors", "service", "public"], "summary": "The only way young doctors can achieve their goal of becoming specialists is to serve in public hospitals.\nHowever, if they are denied permanent positions, they lose that opportunity.\nThe doctor said there are now about 4,600 specialists in various disciplines serving in the public healthcare system.\nHe said if the government does not give existing contract doctors permanent positions, there will eventually be a shortage of specialists.\n\u201cI understand the frustrations many contract doctors are experiencing, because they do not know what their future holds.", "news": "The Sun Daily", "date": "2021-07-05 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Official MKN SOP For Phase 2 Of NRP As Of 23 July (In English)", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wNy8wNi9vZmZpY2lhbC1ta24tc29wLWZvci1waGFzZS0yLW9mLW5ycC1hcy1vZi01LWp1bHktaW4tZW5nbGlzaC_SAXdodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVyYWt5YXRwb3N0LmNvbS9uZXdzL21hbGF5c2lhLzIwMjEvMDcvMDYvb2ZmaWNpYWwtbWtuLXNvcC1mb3ItcGhhc2UtMi1vZi1ucnAtYXMtb2YtNS1qdWx5LWluLWVuZ2xpc2gvYW1wLw?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Azizul Rahman Ismail", "Maya Suraya"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SOP-Phase-2.jpeg", "text": "Subscribe to our new Telegram channel for the latest updates and stories.\n\nAfter the government announced that the National Recovery Plan (NRP) will be implemented state by state instead of nationwide and that 5 states will go into Phase 2 on July 5, new SOPs were released.\n\nRead More: Five States To Go Into Phase 2 on 5 July\n\nOn 7 July, Penang entered Phase 2.\n\nOn 9 July, Sabah entered Phase 2.\n\nOn 14 July Sarawak entered Phase 2.\n\nFor your convenience, TRP took the liberty of translating the latest Phase 2 standard operating procedures (SOP) released by the National Security Council (MKN) on 23 July.\n\nThe new Phase 2 SOP has some minor changes compared to the one released on 16 July.\n\nThe most notable changes are:\n\n60% of workers may return to the office.\n\nMost businesses may operate from 6 am to 10 pm.\n\nSports and recreational activities are allowed between 6 am and 10 pm.\n\nOutdoor filming is allowed.\n\nAccounting firms are allowed to open.\n\nWe marked all the differences in \u2018orange\u2018.\n\nAreas Involved\n\nKELANTAN, TERENGGANU, PAHANG, PERAK, PERLIS, PENANG, SABAH DAN SARAWAK.\n\n*For areas enforced by RMCO, the RMCO SOP in those areas is in force until the end of the RMCO.\n\nDuration\n\nEffective 5 July 2021 (12.01 am) \u2013 Kelantan, Terengganu, Pahang, Perak and Perlis.\n\nEffective 7 July 2021 (12.01 am) \u2013 Penang.\n\nEffective 9 July 2021 (12.01 am) \u2013 Sabah.

latest stories and updates.\n\nMalaysians have proven time and time again that they are worthy of international success in Cannes.\n\nFor some, making it to the Cannes commune figuratively or literally for a festival, award or even a holiday, is a marker of success for many.\n\nIn light of the recent news of the Cannes Film Festival returning after a year hiatus due to the Covid-19 pandemic, film buffs connoisseurs are anticipating a fresh breath of film talent across the globe.\n\nAlthough no Malaysian titles are showcased at the event this year, the city of Cannes on the French Riviera is still renowned for hosting other significant festivals and award shows like Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, and the Cannes Film Awards to name a couple.\n\nCannes Film Festival\n\nIn essence, the Cannes Film Festival is an annual film festival that previews new films of all genres, including documentaries from all around the world.\n\nAside from its main purpose, it is also a roll call for glitz, glam, networking, and parties.\n\nThat said, only a handful of Malaysians have graced this event and they are:\n\n1995: Film director U-Wei Haji Saari\u2019s film \u201cKaki Bakar\u201d (The Arsonist) was the first Malaysian production to be screened in the Un Certain Regard category. It is a take on William Faulkner\u2019s \u2018Barn Burnin\u2019 about the son of an itinerant worker who tries to prevent his volatile father from deliberately setting fires.\n\n2009: The second Malaysian to have been invited to the prestigious film festival is Chris Chong Chan Fui with his film \u201cKaraoke,\u201d which centres on a villagers way of life and the Malaysian palm oil industry. The film premiered in the Directors\u2019 Fortnight stream that year, an independent selection of the film festival.\n\n2010: Following in Karaoke\u2019s footsteps a year later at the Director\u2019s Fortnight is The Tiger Factory by Woo Ming Jin, a profoundly heartbreaking drama about \u201cbaby factories\u201d.\n\n2014: Malaysian documentary producer Indrani Kopal, a Fulbright scholar at the Hofstra University in New York at the time, was selected for her first production \u201cThe Game Changer\u201d. The documentary about Susan Slotnick, who uses dance as a form for rehabilitation for inmates at the Woodbourne Correctional Facility in New York, was shown at the Cannes Short Film Corner.\n\nCannes Film Awards\n\nMalaysians have also been making waves at the Cannes Film Awards. Not to be confused with the Cannes Film Festival, this international film festival celebrates film, filmmakers, producers, musicians, actors, screenwriters, photographers and the arts in general.\n\nThey aim to bring new names to the film industry and support new creators as well.\n\nRanked among the Top 100 most popular film festivals out of 10,000 festivals worldwide, the festival collaborates with experts in the field of European film art.\n\nIn its inaugural year this year, two Malaysians have each bagged an award at the Cannes Film Awards.\n\n\u201cTouch\u201d by Kurisu Lee, a 13-minute film about a young man and his dreams, won Best Asian Film in the Film Awards \u2013 Continental Category while \u201cGarbageman, Nurse, and Cop\u201d by Aiman Samat won Best Crime Film under the Film Awards \u2013 Additional Category.\n\nThe award show was held at the Cote d\u2019Azur Art Gallery in Cannes, France on 8 June.\n\nCannes Lions International Festival of Creativity\n\nFor the advertising and creative communications industry, winning a Cannes Lions is equivalent to being selected for the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nMalaysian agencies have in the past and are still currently winning large at this event.\n\nVJ Anand, former Executive Creative Director of advertising agency BBDO Malaysia and now Head of Creative of VaynerMedia in Singapore recalls the times Malaysia won big at Cannes Lions.\n\nMalaysia has always been pretty good at winning the global advertising stage and I\u2019m sure Malaysia will keep winning.\n\nHe remembers Southeast Asia\u2019s first and Malaysia\u2019s only Cannes Lions Grand Prix (the awards\u2019 most coveted honour) was in 2004 by JWT Malaysia for \u201cMissile Car\u201d, an imaginative guerrilla outdoor campaign to promote Channel Nine.\n\nSince, other creative agencies that have followed the shiny award trail include the following VJ has noted for us:\n\n2007: \u201cTang Hong Ming\u201d by Leo Burnett/Arc Worldwide Malaysia \u2013 a TV commercial by the acclaimed creative director and filmmaker Yasmin Ahmad. It was the first Malaysian TV commercial that ever won a Gold Cannes Lion and is still probably one of Malaysia\u2019s most memorable ads to date.\n\n2008: BBDO/Proximity Malaysia won Gold Lion for Chrysler Korea\u2019s campaign for Jeep in the Outdoor category.\n\n2015: When VJ was Group Executive Creative Director at TBWA\\Kuala Lumpur, they were awarded the Silver Lion for The Eveready Book of Play which was inspired by the traditional Malaysia form of storytelling, the Wayang Kulit (Shadow Play).\n\nMost recently this year, Grey Malaysia won Silver and Bronze Lion for WWF\u2019s Your Plastic Diet. And in association with the Cannes Lions, they also won the most coveted Grand Prix honour at the WARC Awards for Effectiveness for Tesco: Unforgettable Bag.\n\nThere have been many other Malaysians who have strutted away with a Cannes Lion, and for that we should be proud.\n\nREAD MORE: M\u2019sian filmmaker wins award at Cannes 2019 for incredible anti-bullying PSA", "keyword": ["cannes", "lion", "awards", "award", "international", "malaysians", "celebrating", "creative", "won", "festival", "lions", "malaysian"], "summary": "Malaysians have proven time and time again that they are worthy of international success in Cannes.\nCannes Film FestivalIn essence, the Cannes Film Festival is an annual film festival that previews new films of all genres, including documentaries from all around the world.\nIn its inaugural year this year, two Malaysians have each bagged an award at the Cannes Film Awards.\nCannes Lions International Festival of CreativityFor the advertising and creative communications industry, winning a Cannes Lions is equivalent to being selected for the Cannes Film Festival.\nThere have been many other Malaysians who have strutted away with a Cannes Lion, and for that we should be proud.", "news": "The Rakyat Post", "date": "2021-07-04 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "At least 17 killed in Philippines troop plane crash", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS93b3JsZC8yMDIxLzA3LzA0L2F0LWxlYXN0LTE3LWtpbGxlZC1pbi1waGlsaXBwaW5lcy10cm9vcC1wbGFuZS1jcmFzaC_SAQA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MashaMasha2022_1_800x500.jpg", "text": "MANILA: At least 17 people were killed when a Philippines Air Force plane carrying troops crashed on landing in the south of the country and broke up in flames today.\n\nThe Lockheed C-130 transport aircraft crashed at Patikul in Sulu province, in the far south of the archipelago nation where the army has been fighting a long war against Islamist militants from the Abu Sayyaf and other factions.\n\n\u201cSo far 40 wounded and injured were rescued and 17 bodies recovered.

There was hope that this all was going to be over soon.\n\nAs time went by, the rippling effect from the ban grew and that hope began to diminish. As restaurants and kitchens close or shut down, the economic ecosystem surrounding them feel the effect, and people begin to lose their income and their jobs.\n\nFrom the outside looking in, we see that some eateries pivot their businesses towards delivery. However, most food and beverage establishments in Malaysia are not built to fit the delivery model.\n\nEateries such as casual and fine dining restaurants depend on their ambience in addition to their menu. Additionally, not all foods and beverages such as soups and alcoholic drinks are favourable through delivery, and delivery services are costly which eats into the slim profit margins of these businesses and puts them in the red.\n\nThe united F&B joint statement\n\nZakaria Zayane / Unsplash\n\nBecause of the dire situation affecting F&B businesses and their supply chains, a coalition of five F&B associations held a press conference and released a joint statement addressing the matter.\n\nThey urge the Ministry of Health (MOH), National Security Council (MKN), Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP), and any related ministry to engage, discuss and debate with stakeholders (trade associations) for a solution.\n\nThe coalition believes by engaging with them, they could provide a wider perspective that could result in better policies and SOPs.\n\nWe are not asking for handouts, instead we need the government to be reasonable. The F&B industry has been a significantly small contributor to new clusters because many businesses have been compliant We appeal to Putrajaya, let our people come back to work, save small businesses and let us contribute to the nation again\n\nThe coalition is even prepared to help the government to deal with errant operators if their sector is allowed to reopen for dine-ins again.\n\nThe situation\n\nBased on a 2016 census done by The Department of Statistics, the coalition estimated that the move to not allow dine-ins has affected approximately 1 million Malaysians since 2020. This number does not include the farmers, fisheries, suppliers, distributors, and other businesses that depend on restaurants.\n\nThey said that many F&B operators have less than 2 months of cash flow left and are anticipating at least a 60% closure rate if the ban continues.\n\nAn intervention\n\nRowan Freeman / Unsplash\n\nThe coalition also urged the government to scrap the Essential and Non-Essential industry labels as a first step to finding a better solution.\n\nThey also ask that the government engage, and regulate the 2 largest food delivery platforms, as long as dining-in is not allowed.\n\nThe coalition requests a rebate of 15% on the food delivery commission rates from now till Jan 2022.\n\nThe reduction in commission rates can be made up from the influx of users and orders. At the same time, ensure the welfare of the riders is guarded. The review to lower our commission rates should not affect the rider\u2019s abilities to earn a living.\n\nAccording to the coalition, the 2 largest food delivery services charge 30% or more in commissions. This was accepted by most F&B businesses because delivery was seen as marketing and promotion while dine-in and takeaway are the main income.\n\nHowever, when dine-ins are not allowed the 30% commission not only cuts into profit but in a lot of cases make each sale a loss unless prices are increased accordingly.\n\nAt the ready\n\nThe members of the coalition also offer the mobilisation of their social media to help drive vaccination registration numbers, increase vaccine literacy, counter vaccine hesitancy, and reward vaccinated individuals.\n\nIn return, they urge Putrajaya to be transparent and accountable on the expected vaccine arrival timelines so that businesses can plan ahead.\n\nMeanwhile, the coalition of F&B businesses is also being proactive about their situation and is formulating a plan to help both the industry and those in need as well.

The approach to managing both the pandemic and its human consequences have been the same since March last year,\u201d Nungsari said.\n\nMeanwhile, Universiti Putra Malaysia political scientist Prof Dr Jayum Jawan said the effort to address the pandemic and the crippling of the economy and lives should not be confused and conflated with one another.\n\n\u201cThe government at both federal and state levels is putting measures in a concerted effort to manage the pandemic.

So, when the 2018 general election produced no clear majority to any group or political party, the situation becomes vulnerable and the jockeying for power becomes highly tense,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that this volatile period is also aggravated by the fact that some politicians are not ashamed to \u201cjump ship\u201d, and ruling parties or coalitions are also known in the past to have enticed members of legislature from other parties in order to secure a comfortable legislative support.", "keyword": ["wellcoordinated", "instability", "governments", "manage", "effort", "response", "affect", "parties", "majority", "covid", "power", "pandemic", "nungsari", "political"], "summary": "Key industrial hubs such as the Klang Valley and Selangor are still unable to flatten the curveby HARIZAH KAMEL / pic by TMR FILETHE current political instability may affect the government\u2019s ability to implement an effective, well-coordinated plan to manage Covid-19 situation in Malaysia.\n\u201cNevertheless, the continuing political uncertainties could further undermine the government\u2019s ability to implement a well-coordinated, carefully planned and effective response to the twin public health and economic crisis facing the country,\u201d he said.\nYeah noted that political instability is adding to public exasperation over the stubbornly high daily infection cases and mounting economic losses due to the second nation-wide lockdown.\n\u201cThe government at both federal and state levels is putting measures in a concerted effort to manage the pandemic.\nCommenting further on politics, he said the contestation for political power will continue to characterise Malaysia\u2019s politics for some time to come.", "news": "The Malaysian Reserve", "date": "2021-07-12 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "PPV volunteers should be fully vaccinated", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWFsYXlzaWFucmVzZXJ2ZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNy8xNC9wcHYtdm9sdW50ZWVycy1zaG91bGQtYmUtZnVsbHktdmFjY2luYXRlZC_SAVlodHRwczovL3RoZW1hbGF5c2lhbnJlc2VydmUuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvMTQvcHB2LXZvbHVudGVlcnMtc2hvdWxkLWJlLWZ1bGx5LXZhY2NpbmF0ZWQvYW1wLw?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://themalaysianreserve.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MITEC-PIKAS-Vaccine.jpg", "text": "by ASILA JALIL / pic by TMR FILE\n\nVOLUNTEERS and staff members at vaccination centres (PPVs) should be fully vaccinated before they are allowed to perform their duties at the centres.\n\nOsel group chief clinical and innovative scientist Dr Kris See said the Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) should only consider taking in fully vaccinated individuals as volunteers to reduce the symptoms and spread of the virus.\n\n\u201cI think at the fundamental level, CITF should ensure all volunteers are vaccinated completely with two doses.

As a result, many will not go the extra mile for patients because they are not motivated.\u201d\n\nThe specialist said there are many brilliant young doctors working with him but they do not know where they will be when their contracts expire.\n\nHe urged the government to quickly address the issue to ensure that the public health service can continue to provide the best care possible.", "keyword": ["specialist", "permanent", "mma", "positions", "opportunity", "doctor", "contract", "healthcare", "denies", "temporary", "specialists", "appointment", "doctors", "service", "public"], "summary": "The only way young doctors can achieve their goal of becoming specialists is to serve in public hospitals.\nHowever, if they are denied permanent positions, they lose that opportunity.\nThe doctor said there are now about 4,600 specialists in various disciplines serving in the public healthcare system.\nHe said if the government does not give existing contract doctors permanent positions, there will eventually be a shortage of specialists.\n\u201cI understand the frustrations many contract doctors are experiencing, because they do not know what their future holds.", "news": "The Sun Daily", "date": "2021-07-05 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Official MKN SOP For Phase 2 Of NRP As Of 23 July (In English)", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wNy8wNi9vZmZpY2lhbC1ta24tc29wLWZvci1waGFzZS0yLW9mLW5ycC1hcy1vZi01LWp1bHktaW4tZW5nbGlzaC_SAXdodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVyYWt5YXRwb3N0LmNvbS9uZXdzL21hbGF5c2lhLzIwMjEvMDcvMDYvb2ZmaWNpYWwtbWtuLXNvcC1mb3ItcGhhc2UtMi1vZi1ucnAtYXMtb2YtNS1qdWx5LWluLWVuZ2xpc2gvYW1wLw?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Azizul Rahman Ismail", "Maya Suraya"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SOP-Phase-2.jpeg", "text": "Subscribe to our new Telegram channel for the latest updates and stories.\n\nAfter the government announced that the National Recovery Plan (NRP) will be implemented state by state instead of nationwide and that 5 states will go into Phase 2 on July 5, new SOPs were released.\n\nRead More: Five States To Go Into Phase 2 on 5 July\n\nOn 7 July, Penang entered Phase 2.\n\nOn 9 July, Sabah entered Phase 2.\n\nOn 14 July Sarawak entered Phase 2.\n\nFor your convenience, TRP took the liberty of translating the latest Phase 2 standard operating procedures (SOP) released by the National Security Council (MKN) on 23 July.\n\nThe new Phase 2 SOP has some minor changes compared to the one released on 16 July.\n\nThe most notable changes are:\n\n60% of workers may return to the office.\n\nMost businesses may operate from 6 am to 10 pm.\n\nSports and recreational activities are allowed between 6 am and 10 pm.\n\nOutdoor filming is allowed.\n\nAccounting firms are allowed to open.\n\nWe marked all the differences in \u2018orange\u2018.\n\nAreas Involved\n\nKELANTAN, TERENGGANU, PAHANG, PERAK, PERLIS, PENANG, SABAH DAN SARAWAK.\n\n*For areas enforced by RMCO, the RMCO SOP in those areas is in force until the end of the RMCO.\n\nDuration\n\nEffective 5 July 2021 (12.01 am) \u2013 Kelantan, Terengganu, Pahang, Perak and Perlis.\n\nEffective 7 July 2021 (12.01 am) \u2013 Penang.\n\nEffective 9 July 2021 (12.01 am) \u2013 Sabah.

latest stories and updates.\n\nMalaysians have proven time and time again that they are worthy of international success in Cannes.\n\nFor some, making it to the Cannes commune figuratively or literally for a festival, award or even a holiday, is a marker of success for many.\n\nIn light of the recent news of the Cannes Film Festival returning after a year hiatus due to the Covid-19 pandemic, film buffs connoisseurs are anticipating a fresh breath of film talent across the globe.\n\nAlthough no Malaysian titles are showcased at the event this year, the city of Cannes on the French Riviera is still renowned for hosting other significant festivals and award shows like Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, and the Cannes Film Awards to name a couple.\n\nCannes Film Festival\n\nIn essence, the Cannes Film Festival is an annual film festival that previews new films of all genres, including documentaries from all around the world.\n\nAside from its main purpose, it is also a roll call for glitz, glam, networking, and parties.\n\nThat said, only a handful of Malaysians have graced this event and they are:\n\n1995: Film director U-Wei Haji Saari\u2019s film \u201cKaki Bakar\u201d (The Arsonist) was the first Malaysian production to be screened in the Un Certain Regard category. It is a take on William Faulkner\u2019s \u2018Barn Burnin\u2019 about the son of an itinerant worker who tries to prevent his volatile father from deliberately setting fires.\n\n2009: The second Malaysian to have been invited to the prestigious film festival is Chris Chong Chan Fui with his film \u201cKaraoke,\u201d which centres on a villagers way of life and the Malaysian palm oil industry. The film premiered in the Directors\u2019 Fortnight stream that year, an independent selection of the film festival.\n\n2010: Following in Karaoke\u2019s footsteps a year later at the Director\u2019s Fortnight is The Tiger Factory by Woo Ming Jin, a profoundly heartbreaking drama about \u201cbaby factories\u201d.\n\n2014: Malaysian documentary producer Indrani Kopal, a Fulbright scholar at the Hofstra University in New York at the time, was selected for her first production \u201cThe Game Changer\u201d. The documentary about Susan Slotnick, who uses dance as a form for rehabilitation for inmates at the Woodbourne Correctional Facility in New York, was shown at the Cannes Short Film Corner.\n\nCannes Film Awards\n\nMalaysians have also been making waves at the Cannes Film Awards. Not to be confused with the Cannes Film Festival, this international film festival celebrates film, filmmakers, producers, musicians, actors, screenwriters, photographers and the arts in general.\n\nThey aim to bring new names to the film industry and support new creators as well.\n\nRanked among the Top 100 most popular film festivals out of 10,000 festivals worldwide, the festival collaborates with experts in the field of European film art.\n\nIn its inaugural year this year, two Malaysians have each bagged an award at the Cannes Film Awards.\n\n\u201cTouch\u201d by Kurisu Lee, a 13-minute film about a young man and his dreams, won Best Asian Film in the Film Awards \u2013 Continental Category while \u201cGarbageman, Nurse, and Cop\u201d by Aiman Samat won Best Crime Film under the Film Awards \u2013 Additional Category.\n\nThe award show was held at the Cote d\u2019Azur Art Gallery in Cannes, France on 8 June.\n\nCannes Lions International Festival of Creativity\n\nFor the advertising and creative communications industry, winning a Cannes Lions is equivalent to being selected for the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nMalaysian agencies have in the past and are still currently winning large at this event.\n\nVJ Anand, former Executive Creative Director of advertising agency BBDO Malaysia and now Head of Creative of VaynerMedia in Singapore recalls the times Malaysia won big at Cannes Lions.\n\nMalaysia has always been pretty good at winning the global advertising stage and I\u2019m sure Malaysia will keep winning.\n\nHe remembers Southeast Asia\u2019s first and Malaysia\u2019s only Cannes Lions Grand Prix (the awards\u2019 most coveted honour) was in 2004 by JWT Malaysia for \u201cMissile Car\u201d, an imaginative guerrilla outdoor campaign to promote Channel Nine.\n\nSince, other creative agencies that have followed the shiny award trail include the following VJ has noted for us:\n\n2007: \u201cTang Hong Ming\u201d by Leo Burnett/Arc Worldwide Malaysia \u2013 a TV commercial by the acclaimed creative director and filmmaker Yasmin Ahmad. It was the first Malaysian TV commercial that ever won a Gold Cannes Lion and is still probably one of Malaysia\u2019s most memorable ads to date.\n\n2008: BBDO/Proximity Malaysia won Gold Lion for Chrysler Korea\u2019s campaign for Jeep in the Outdoor category.\n\n2015: When VJ was Group Executive Creative Director at TBWA\\Kuala Lumpur, they were awarded the Silver Lion for The Eveready Book of Play which was inspired by the traditional Malaysia form of storytelling, the Wayang Kulit (Shadow Play).\n\nMost recently this year, Grey Malaysia won Silver and Bronze Lion for WWF\u2019s Your Plastic Diet. And in association with the Cannes Lions, they also won the most coveted Grand Prix honour at the WARC Awards for Effectiveness for Tesco: Unforgettable Bag.\n\nThere have been many other Malaysians who have strutted away with a Cannes Lion, and for that we should be proud.\n\nREAD MORE: M\u2019sian filmmaker wins award at Cannes 2019 for incredible anti-bullying PSA", "keyword": ["cannes", "lion", "awards", "award", "international", "malaysians", "celebrating", "creative", "won", "festival", "lions", "malaysian"], "summary": "Malaysians have proven time and time again that they are worthy of international success in Cannes.\nCannes Film FestivalIn essence, the Cannes Film Festival is an annual film festival that previews new films of all genres, including documentaries from all around the world.\nIn its inaugural year this year, two Malaysians have each bagged an award at the Cannes Film Awards.\nCannes Lions International Festival of CreativityFor the advertising and creative communications industry, winning a Cannes Lions is equivalent to being selected for the Cannes Film Festival.\nThere have been many other Malaysians who have strutted away with a Cannes Lion, and for that we should be proud.", "news": "The Rakyat Post", "date": "2021-07-04 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "At least 17 killed in Philippines troop plane crash", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS93b3JsZC8yMDIxLzA3LzA0L2F0LWxlYXN0LTE3LWtpbGxlZC1pbi1waGlsaXBwaW5lcy10cm9vcC1wbGFuZS1jcmFzaC_SAQA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MashaMasha2022_1_800x500.jpg", "text": "MANILA: At least 17 people were killed when a Philippines Air Force plane carrying troops crashed on landing in the south of the country and broke up in flames today.\n\nThe Lockheed C-130 transport aircraft crashed at Patikul in Sulu province, in the far south of the archipelago nation where the army has been fighting a long war against Islamist militants from the Abu Sayyaf and other factions.\n\n\u201cSo far 40 wounded and injured were rescued and 17 bodies recovered.
