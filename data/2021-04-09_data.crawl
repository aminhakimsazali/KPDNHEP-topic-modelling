RM1.8 billion in subsidy, a hefty increase from RM400 million currently.\n\n\u201cIf the RBD palm olein price continues to show an upward trend, the subsidy cost for the scheme is expected to increase

Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) has issued 84 notices against food and beverage premises operators nationwide for charging more than RM1 for a glass of plain water.\n\nIts Deputy Minister Datuk Rosol Wahid said all the notices were issued through Ops Catut 8.0 carried out since Wednesday (April 7) following complaints from the public.\n\n\u201cThe operation will be carried out until April 15 by enforcement teams nationwide. Based on the number of notices issued, we find that this is quite a common occurrence.\n\n\u201cThis should not happen... maybe a more appropriate price would be between RM0.20 or RM0.30,\u201c he told reporters after officiating the Terengganu state-level Franchise Bay Tour Programme here today.\n\nOf the 84 notices, Kelantan recorded the highest number with 14, followed by Selangor (12), Sabah (eight), Sarawak (eight), Johor (eight), Pahang (seven), Terengganu (six), Kuala Lumpur (five), Melaka (four), Federal Territory of Labuan (three), Penang (three), Perlis (two), Perak (two) and Negeri Sembilan (two).\n\nTraders who are issued with the notice will be given two to five working days to provide the information required by KPDNHEP before further action is taken in accordance with the Price Control and Anti -Profiteering Act 2011.\n\nMeanwhile, Rosol called on more franchisors to take advantage of the Micro and Affordable Franchise Development Programme to help create better opportunities for entrepreneurs, especially those in the B40 and M40 target groups.\n\nHe said there were currently 1,091 franchise brands registered in Malaysia, of which 694 were local franchise brands.\n\n\u201cHowever, so far only 12 franchise brands have offered micro franchises and affordable franchises. The number is still too small compared to the 1,091 registered franchise brands,\u201d he said.\n\nAffordable franchises are business packages worth RM100 thousand and below, while micro franchises are worth RM50 thousand and below.\n\nRosol said KPDNHEP had allocated a total of RM5 million for the Affordable and Micro Franchise Development Programme, comprising full grants worth RM2 million offered to franchisors, and matching grants totalling RM2.5 million for those from the B40 and M40 groups looking to open a franchise.\n\nOn an unrelated matter, Rosol, who is also Hulu Terengganu MP, said KPDNHEP was monitoring motorcycle sales activities around the Klang Valley, where customers were apparently finding it difficult to purchase new two-wheelers in cash.\n\n\u201cRecently I have received complaints from customers who say they find it difficult to buy motorcycles in cash, because sellers prefer customers to purchase them in installments.\n\n\u201cIf there are reports that traders are pressuring customers, KPDNHEP can investigate. There may be offences (committed) that we can take action against, especially if traders set different prices for the purchase of motorcycles in cash or monthly installments,\u201c he said.\n\nHe added that apart from keeping the people away from the burden of debt, he also did not want them to be saddled with interest payments.\n\n\u201cI think there may be an alliance between the motor companies and finance institutions... imagine if there is a charge of 5% or 8% in interest over five years, how much will they earn (compared to the cash deal) ... if there are two different prices according to the method of purchase, this is wrong,\u201c he said. \u2014 Bernama", "keyword": ["water", "issued", "priced", "84", "franchise", "terengganu", "micro", "nationwide", "glass", "plain", "notices", "kpdnhep", "franchises", "purchase", "issues", "customers", "rm1", "worth"], "summary": "KUALA TERENGGANU: The Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) has issued 84 notices against food and beverage premises operators nationwide for charging more than RM1 for a glass of plain water.\nBased on the number of notices issued, we find that this is quite a common occurrence.\n\u201cHowever, so far only 12 franchise brands have offered micro franchises and affordable franchises.\nAffordable franchises are business packages worth RM100 thousand and below, while micro franchises are worth RM50 thousand and below.\n\u201cIf there are reports that traders are pressuring customers, KPDNHEP can investigate.", "news": "The Sun Daily", "date": "2021-04-10 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Kelantan KPDNHEP seizes 800kg of flour sold without licence", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEPdxU7tI-7bms0z3UhdRH6kqGQgEKhAIACoHCAow9sveCjC0m9YBMPDtoQM?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/kpdnKel925_NSTfield_image_socialmedia.var_1618148048.jpg", "text": "", "keyword": ["flour", "licence", "seizes", "kpdnhep", "kelantan", "800kg", "sold"], "summary": "", "news": "New Straits Times", "date": "2021-04-11 00:00:00", "language": "INDONESIA"}, {"title": "Need Refund From Online Sellers Or Chicken Prices Too High?

the state to monitor and inspect various locations such as public markets, farmers\u2019 markets and supermarkets to ensure the supply and prices of essential goods, including chickens, are stable and adequate for the Ramadan month and Hari Raya Aidilfitri.\n\nIt further said according to the National Price Council Division (BHBN)of KPDNHEP Sarawak, the selling price of standard clean chicken from January to this month is between RM7.90 and RM8.80 per kg.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the price is at normal levels and does not show any unusual increase,\u201d it pointed out in a statement

maintaining a subsidised cooking oil quota of 60,000 tonnes per month despite the increase in the price of refined, bleached and deodorised (RBD) palm oil, says Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi (picture).\n\nThis is equivalent to 60 million one-kilogramme (kg) polybag packets, with 1.5 kg allocated for every Malaysian, including in Sabah and Sarawak.\n\nNanta said RBD palm oil increased by about 83 per cent to RM4,122 per tonne this year compared to RM2,255 per tonne in 2020.\n\n\u201cThe government has also increased the allocation based on a commitment to supply 60,000 tonnes although the price of RBD palm olein has gone up,\u201d he said, adding that the government expected the cost of the subsidy scheme to increase from RM400 million to RM1.8 billion if the price of RBD palm olein continued to rise.\n\n\u201cAs such, the government\u2019s decision to maintain the quota in the Cooking Oil Stabilisation Scheme (COSS) shows the government\u2019s high commitment to reduce the cost of living and ensure the well-being of the people,\u201d he said in a statement today.\n\nThe statement was issued following news reports on alleged shortage of subsidised cooking oil in Sarawak which stemmed from the dishonest action of cooking oil packaging companies of not supplying subsidised cooking oil in prescribed quantities for distribution to supermarkets and grocery stores.\n\nThe report also suggested that KPDNHEP step up monitoring and enforcement on subsidised cooking oil packaging activities and ensure that the RM400 million cooking oil subsidy allocation this year is spent prudently.\n\nNanta said KPDNHEP\u2019s enforcement division always conducted comprehensive audits to ensure that every subsidised cooking oil production was acceptable in each of its distribution chains.\n\nFollowing the audit and stern action in tackling the leakage of subsidised cooking oil distribution, Nanta said a total of 318 cases had been recorded nationwide from 2016 to March 2021.\n\nDuring the same period, four cooking oil packaging companies were taken to task by cancelling the quotas given to them earlier, he said.\n\nOn complaints related to cooking oil in Sarawak, Nanta said a review of records found that there had been 25 complaints since 2020 until March 31 (2021) and 4,221 inspections conducted on premises selling cooking oil until yesterday (April 12).\n\nOn the sugar issue which was also touched on in the news report, Nanta said in principle, the selling price of domestic sugar was controlled at a maximum price of RM2.85 per kg for coarse refined white sugar and RM2.95 per kg for refined white sugar for retail sale.\n\nThe wholesale selling price of sugar for use in the food and beverage (F&B) industry is set at RM2.77 per kg for coarse refined white sugar and RM2.85 per kg for refined white sugar.\n\n\u201cThe difference in lower sugar prices can be enjoyed by F&B companies based on the quantity and method of purchase agreed upon with the supplier, and also depending on the price of raw sugar in the world market without government intervention,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the news report, the F&B industry now has to spend more to get refined sugar at RM2.75 per kg.\n\nNanta said local F&B companies and wholesalers could apply for permits to import refined sugar at any time of the year.\n\n\u201cEligible applications will be carefully considered by an evaluation committee represented by several relevant government agencies including the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, the Malaysian Investment Development Authority and the Royal Malaysian Customs Department, he said.\n\n\u201cThe priority of issuing import permits is to any F&B manufacturing company and wholesaler that meets the evaluation criteria set,\u201d he added.\n\nNanta said continuous monitoring would be carried out on the recipients of permits to import refined sugar to prevent misuse and

yesterday claimed that there is a shortage of subsidised 1kg pack of cooking oil due to under-production by some repackers who have been receiving government subsidies.\n\nThe former deputy minister of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) said the government had allocated RM400 million for the cooking oil price stabilisation scheme this year alone to enable the needy across Malaysia to buy the subsidised cooking oil at RM2.50.\n\n\u201cEvery year, there is government allocation to maintain the price of the 1kg subsidised cooking oil at RM2.50. The allocation for this year is RM400 million and it was also RM400 million last year.\n\n\u201cWhen PH (Pakatan Harapan) was the government, the allocation was RM720 million in 2018 and RM600 million in 2019. During our time, we made sure all this amount go to packing the subsidised cooking oil. But lately I noticed that there is a huge shortage of this 1kg cooking oil,\u201d he said during his Facebook live in e-Mart Batu Kawa here.\n\nChong, who is Stampin MP and Kota Sentosa assemblyman, claimed that some repackers had resorted to over-claiming of subsidies or under-production of subsidised cooking oil.\n\nFor instance, he said a repacker who was supposed to pack 1,500kg of cooking oil only packed 1,000kg but still claimed the subsidy amount for 1,500kg.\n\n\u201cDuring PH\u2019s time, it\u2019s very seldom that you didn\u2019t get the 1kg cooking oil in the market. But after PH is no longer the government, most of the time you can\u2019t get this 1kg cooking oil.\n\n\u201cWhy? I believe the hanky panky thing has found its way back to the system. That\u2019s why we are having this Facebook live to forewarn the government,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also called upon his former colleagues at KPDNHEP to carry out strict enforcement to ensure a stable supply of the subsidised cooking oil.\n\nWhen he was the deputy KPDNHEP minister, Chong said they kept a record of the volume repackers delivered to the retailers, who must then have a record for the ministry to cross check.\n\nWith such strict enforcement, he said the government would be able to make sure that the allocation could benefit the target groups.\n\n\u201cI think the situation is quite bad now, a lot of time you can\u2019t find the 1kg cooking oil. After all, it\u2019s RM400 million of government allocation we are talking about.\u201d\n\nChong said the previous PH government managed to bring down the price of sugar to RM1.70 or RM1.80 per kg for food and beverages (F&B) manufacturers but today, they had to fork out RM2.75 per kg.\n\nHe added that the former federal government opened up sugar import for F&B manufacturers in Sarawak.\n\nHe was glad that the current federal government had carried on the policy but some F&B manufacturers in the state had complained that their applications for sugar import had been rejected by Putrajaya.\n\n\u201c(KPDNHEP Minister Datuk) Alexandar Nanta Linggi is a Sarawakian. He can do much better than what I did as a deputy minister since he is a full minister.\n\n\u201cI will talk to Alexandar Nanta and ask him to make it easier for F&B manufacturers in Sarawak to apply for the sugar import permit,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier, Chong handed out shopping vouchers worth RM100 to about 40 needy individuals under a social programme in collaboration with e-Mart Batu Kawa to

introduced 20 initiatives since 2020 to help companies and entrepreneurs reduce the impact of Covid-19 in their businesses.\n\nOf these initiatives, three of them were also announced in the Pemerkasa agenda.\n\nSSM\u2019s first initiative in Pemerkasa was to increase the current threshold value of indebtedness under Section 466 of the Companies Act 2016 from RM10,000 to RM50,000 until Dec 31, 2020, along with the period to respond to a notice of claim by a company was also extended to six months.\n\n\u201cTaking into account the uncertainties in the global and domestic economic conditions following the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, SSM has also announced that the company\u2019s indebtedness threshold was raised to RM50,000 effective April 1, 2021, as a new permanent threshold value,\u201d said Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi in his speech during SSM\u2019s 19th Anniversary Ceremony in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.\n\nThe second initiative offers free business registration facilities to B40 group entrepreneurs and full -time IPT students who wish to venture into entrepreneurship while the third initiative was offering assistance to the disabled to register and renew their business with SSM for free.\n\nHe added SSM remains committed to helping ease the burden of the business community by implementing initiatives to extend the compound exemption for delays in renewing business registrations and delays in registering new businesses under the Business Registration Act 1956 until Dec 31 this year which will benefit over 330,000 business communities.\n\nThe minister announced this initiative on March 30, as an extension of the implementation of the compound exemption for delays in renewing business registration certificates implemented from March 17 \u2013 Dec 31, 2020, before being extended until June 30 this year.\n\nIn the same event he said SSM has spent a total of RM3.6 million in corporate zakat allocation and RM242,500 in corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives in 2020.\n\n\u201cI hope that SSM will be more successful in the future and be able to continue this noble endeavour,\u201d he added.\n\nSSM also launched the \u2018Usahawan Bijak, Usahawan Berdaftar\u2019 campaign that aims to produce ethical and trusted entrepreneurs and will be implemented throughout 2021.\n\nThe campaign is one of the methods to encourage the public, especially traders to register businesses.\n\nAll businesses need to register with SSM either under the Business Registration Act 1956 which applies in Peninsular Malaysia and the Federal Territory of Labuan or under the Companies Act 2016 and the Limited Liability Partnership Act 2012.\n\nThrough this campaign, SSM calls on all

I have very little information on her and her family as my mother would not want to share much on her sister who was \u2018given away\u2019 or maybe she really didn\u2019t know much about them as she was from another mother,\u201d Sim explained.\n\n\u201cThen 21 years ago we managed to meet up for the first time. Then Toh Puan Sri had just married Tun Pehin Sri Salahuddin. Suddenly our family size grew following the meeting for the first time between Toh Puan Sri and my mum, since their birth.\u201d\n\nAlthough Norkiah was given up for adoption to a Malay family back in the early 50s, when the situations in those days were tough with some households having more than 10 children, it was not unusual for families to give away their children (particularly girls) to young couples who were not able to conceive their own, he said.\n\n\u201cA few months after the family meeting, Tun Pehin Sri Salahuddin was appointed as the Governor of Sarawak again (for the second time) and my late auntie\u2019s life took a huge change. Her role changed drastically from a loving wife to Tun, but was elevated to First Lady of Sarawak.\n\n\u201cThe late Toh Puan Sri was fortunate because her life story would become one that is reminiscent of the Cinderella story when she met, fell in love and married Tun Pehin Sri. She was Tun Pehin Sri\u2019s second wife after his first wife had passed away,\u201d Sim added.\n\n\u201cShe was born into a poor Chinese family and given away to an equally poor Malay family and like Cinderella she ended up happy ever after in the Astana of Sarawak as the First Lady of Sarawak.\n\n\u201cShe made sure that her years as First Lady were not wasted. She started her charity works, helped and touched so many lives like the orphans, elderly and the poor. She was generous, approachable, down to earth and putting others first.\u201d\n\nSince then, she had dedicated her life to the wellbeing of others, playing her role as the mother to all Sarawakians regardless of race or creed, Sim added.\n\n(For the freshest news, join our Telegram channel)\n\n\u201cIndeed Toh Puan\u2019s life is part and parcel of Sarawak\u2019s story. Hers is similar to that of Datin Amar Dato Hajjah Juma\u2019ani Tuanku Haji Bujang, wife of the Chief Minister (Datuk Patinggi Abang Johari Tun Openg), who was also adopted by a Muslim family from a Chinese family.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy aunty and Tun Pehin Sri had brought much peace, harmony and unity of all Sarawakians. They would be joining my activities by lending their support especially during Inter-cultural Mooncake festival. They would not miss any of the annual celebrations held at Carpenter Street. They would grace dinner functions hosted by many associations that me and my late father Datuk Sim Swee Yong were involved in. Their show of love for all Sarawakians irrespective of race and religion is what makes us and Sarawakians unique and special,\u201d added Sim.\n\n\u201cShe was a shining example of our unity in diversity. Her upbringing in a Muslim and Malay family is very typical of our Sarawakian lifestyle in the early 50s and 60s when children were given for adoption due to poverty. This priceless practice is the saving grace of our bond and unity of all races in Sarawak. It has brought much peace, harmony and progress,\u201d he further said.\n\nThe blood relation of Sarawakians is not just a rhetoric but a real phenomenon in Sarawak and although the giving away of children isn\u2019t as common as it was before, the result of sharing in the early years of our history has united Sarawakians, he shared.\n\n\u201cThat is unique and Sarawak is like no other place in Malaysia.\u201d\n\nNorkian passed away around 12pm on Wednesday at the Sarawak General Hospital here and was laid to rest at the Samariang Muslim cemetery. She was 72.

Instead, let the interministerial discussion happen, then formulate a pricing index and monitor it.\n\n\u201cMake a one-year action plan, not only for festive season. Run it for a year, check every month (whether it is) working or not. If something is wrong, solve it,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve (TMR).\n\nGeorge, with 45 years of experience addressing public interest issues, said the government is not engaging consumer groups to handle the problem.\n\nHe said price hike will change consumers\u2019 purchasing patterns which activate the panic buying mode where people buy more and impact the distribution chain.\n\n\u201cThe government needs to set a competent task force with intelligent members to sit with policymakers, so they can advise the ministers after being on the ground on a plan of action that can be rolled out to address the issue.\n\n\u201cTo come out with realistic costs, we have to make sure people on the ground or people in the marketplace are not profiteering,\u201d he added.\n\nGeorge said he was part of a task force which was set up before the last election, but the committee didn\u2019t get off the ground with the change in government.\n\nMeanwhile, Federation of Malaysian Consumers Associations (Fomca) CEO Datuk Dr Paul Selvaraj said increases in prices are not just an immediate problem, but caused by investment in agriculture and supply chain competitiveness.\n\nHe said a lot of production is still dependent on imports and when the prices go up in the international market, the country gets affected.\n\n\u201cFomca always advocates moving forward self-sufficiency so that we are not impacted by world trade or problems from other markets.\n\n\u201cWe neglect the agriculture sector and do not beat up the demand of our modern economy. We still import beef, fish and vegetables,\u201d he told TMR.\n\nHe said Malaysia needs to shift focus to agriculture production by maintaining a vibrant industry, not only for production purposes, but also to attract new generations.\n\n\u201cTo make it attractive, it must be viable and (can) provide a good income. In other countries, developing sustainable agriculture is a major stake. Why can\u2019t we do that?\u201d he added.\n\nHe also said the Malaysia Competition Commission did a market surveillance on food and they found that along the supply chain, there is a lot of market manipulation that gets people together and manipulates prices.\n\nWhile conducting the survey, \u201cthey also identified a long supply chain where the market manipulation is going on. Monopolistic behaviour makes consumers suffer\u201d.\n\n\u201cSince the information is there and a survey has been done, the government should take action towards these people who take advantage of profit gearing. It should be a continuing enforcement,\u201d he said.\n\nMalaysian Muslim Consumers Association lead activist Datuk Nadzim Johan said the government does not really play their role to address the increasing prices of essential items.\n\n\u201cIt is a big challenge, but we have an option actually. But we chose the wrong way. Why do we have to buy chillies from Thailand at RM26 per kg?\n\n\u201cOur agriculture is still lagging. Why don\u2019t we plant those vegetables ourselves?\u201d he told TMR.\n\nNadzim said the current state of Emergency needs to end immediately to tackle this issue which can lead to serious problems, such as unemployment, suicide and high debt.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the Emergency is necessary in the first place.

Najib has no privity of contract with the bank,\u201d he said.\n\nSithambaram, who was given a special licence by the attorney-general to prosecute Najib\u2019s SRC International corruption case, said \u201cthe defence has to respond to the prosecution\u2019s case on the seven charges\u201d faced by the former prime minister.\n\n\u201cThe issue of forged or unauthorised scan (of signatures) and electronic transfer is a non-starter, especially for the criminal breach of trust charges.\n\n\u201cThe issue raised is a red herring by the defence, and who would have the audacity to fix a then sitting prime minister?\u201d he asked.\n\nHe said SRC did not sue the bank for negligence or asked the financial institution to pay back the money.\n\n\u201cNo company will keep quiet if there is no proper authorisation and withdrawal of money.\u201d\n\nSithambaram said there was evidence that the SRC directors had authorised the bank to conduct electronic transfers and the bank said it had also acted based on the mandate of SRC signatories.\n\nIn fact, he said, Najib had not returned the RM42 million although he had admitted receiving the money that belonged to SRC.\n\n\u201cHe only said (he did not have) knowledge of how the money came in but we have proven the RM42 million went into his accounts,\u201d he said, adding that the prosecution was raising this issue as \u201cwe want to take the bull by the horns\u201d.\n\nNajib\u2019s lead counsel, Muhammad Shafee Abdullah, had said last week the prosecution\u2019s case would have collapsed if the evidence of one of the signatories and then SRC directors, Suboh Md Yassin, was rejected by the High Court as he had made contradictory statements.\n\nSuboh had said he had at first told Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) investigators who met him in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates on Nov 17, 2015, that the 13 signatures in the electronic fund transfer instructions to the bank were genuine.\n\nHowever, he said while being cross-examined by Shafee, he told MACC officers in Putrajaya on May 28 and 30, 2018 that his signatures could have been forged.\n\nSuboh also said he once again told MACC officers on Aug 13 and 15, 2018 that the signatures were genuine.\n\nThe defence had suggested that former SRC chief executive officer Nik Faisal Ariff Kamil could have \u201cphotoshopped\u201d (digitally manipulated) Suboh\u2019s signature in the scanned copies before sending them to the bank to carry out the instructions to transfer funds.\n\nShafee had also suggested that Nik Faisal, who has gone missing, had forged and misused Suboh\u2019s signature and put it in the hard copies.\n\nNik Faisal and Suboh were the signatories of the SRC account from which money was transferred to Gandingan Mentari, a subsidiary of SRC.\n\nThey were also signatories of the Gandingan Mentari account, where money was transferred to Ihsan Perdana, a company selected to carry out corporate social responsibility programmes for SRC.\n\nThe prosecution contends that RM42 million from Ihsan Perdana was transferred to Najib\u2019s three Ambank accounts at the Jalan Raja Chulan branch through a \u201clayering process\u201d to conceal its origin.\n\nTrial judge Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali sentenced Najib in July last year to 12 years\u2019 jail and ordered him to pay a RM210 million fine after finding him guilty on the seven counts of abuse of power, criminal breach of trust and money laundering in relation to the RM42 million belonging to SRC.\n\nHe is appealing against his conviction and

optimisation, among others\n\nBy NUR HANANI AZMAN\n\nTHE possible merger between Celcom Axiata Bhd and DiGi.com Bhd would allow the combined entity to better compete in the 5G environment via scale, improved balance sheet and operational execution.\n\nWith 5G services offered via a wholesale arrangement (5G special purpose vehicle), mobile operators no longer need to spend heavily on capital expenditure (capex) but instead focus on price and branding, said RHB Investment Bank Bhd analyst Jeffrey Tan.\n\n\u201cConsolidation would, however, see the number of operators reduced and by extension, result in lesser competition,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve.\n\nOn April 8, Axiata Group Bhd and Telenor Asia Pte Ltd announced that they are in advanced discussions on the potential merger of Celcom and Digi, with the joint entity to be known as Celcom Digi Bhd or MergeCo.\n\nAxiata and Digi will have an equal stake of about 33.1% each in MergeCo, while Axiata together with local institutional funds will own over 51% of MergeCo.\n\nThe merged entity would have a combined 19.1 million customers and total revenue of RM12.4 billion.\n\nWhether this merger fails or succeeds, Jeffrey said it is imperative for mobile operators to consider the longer-term sustainability of the industry and to collaborate in ways to ensure their continued existence in the face of digitalisation.\n\n\u201cThere are lower execution risks with this proposal in that the scope of the merger is significantly smaller and national interests are taken into consideration,\u201d he added.\n\nBoth telecommunications companies (telcos) will work towards finalising the agreement in relation to the proposed transaction within the second quarter of 2021 (2Q21) following due diligence and are expected to complete the exercise latest by 1Q22.\n\nInvestors appear to welcome the merger plan. On resumption of trade last Friday, Digi surged 71 sen or 18.93% to RM4.46, while Axiata rose 31 sen or 8.16% to close at RM4.11 per share.\n\nWhile the parties have committed to no forced layoff of staff, the option of voluntary separation schemes and retraining programmes may be introduced.\n\nAmInvestment Bank Bhd (AmInvest) analyst Alex Goh said the merged entity is expected to generate synergies from cost optimisation, re-engineering of network operations, reduced redundancies and procurement rationalisation.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, the merger aims to catalyse revenue growth from dual-brand strategy, integrating operations, digitalisation and coordination on home fibre convergence play.\n\n\u201cThe enlarged scale of operations will also provide additional financial flexibility for future capex rollouts,\u201d he noted in a report last week.\n\nAssuming a 10% reduction in operating expenditures and capex for the combined entity, AmInvest estimated potential savings of RM4.3 billion over five years, which translates to 10% of Celcom Digi\u2019s potential market capitalisation of RM41 billion.\n\nThis is based on Digi\u2019s current share price which has been adjusted for the RM1.7 billion cash outflow.\n\nAmInvest reckons that Digi could benefit more than Celcom from the exercise.\n\n\u201cWe estimate that Digi\u2019s forecasted financial year ending 2022 earnings per share will increase by 5%, while Axiata will decrease by 10% as Digi\u2019s equity appears to be valued 67% above Celcom\u2019s from the share and cash exchange,\u201d said Goh.\n\nThe investment bank maintained an \u2018Overweight\u2019 call on the telecommunications sector with a \u2018Buy\u2019 call on Telekom Malaysia Bhd and Axiata.\n\n\u201cWhile retaining our \u2018Hold\u2019 call on Digi for now, we expect to upgrade to a \u2018Buy\u2019 should the parties complete the value-accretive agreement.\n\n\u201cMaxis Bhd remains a \u2018Hold\u2019 given the consolidation of its rivals will erode its current pole position,\u201d he explained.\n\nHong Leong Investment Bank Bhd (HLIB) analyst Tan J Young said market consolidation usually leads to healthier market rivalry, less price undercutting for market share, improved operational leverage, effective capex spending (no duplication) and more procurement bargaining power.\n\n\u201cThe MergeCo will be the largest telco with revenue and subs market share of circa 34% and more than 40% respectively.\n\n\u201cThe companies believe this is an addressable issue by taking into consideration over-the-top market share,\u201d he said in a note.\n\nAlthough MergeCo will have the largest airwave holdings, J Young does not think this will attract any concern due to its large subscriber base.\n\nHe does not discount the possibility that MergeCo will consolidate its towers by maximising the usage of Digi towers, thus reducing its tower rental from edotco Group Sdn Bhd.\n\nHLIB maintained its \u2018Neutral\u2019 call on the telco sector and reiterated its emphasis on fixed over mobile as they are the prime beneficiaries in broadband or 5G infrastructure deployment.

to spend RM1.8b in subsidy\n\nby SHAHEERA AZNAM SHAH / pic by RAZAK GHAZALI\n\nTHE Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) is maintaining the monthly quota for subsidised cooking oil through the Cooking Oil Stabilisation Scheme (COSS) at 60,000 tonnes amid the spike in the refined bleached and deodorised (RBD) palm olein price this year.\n\nThe price of vegetable cooking oil has surged 83% to RM4,122 per tonne in 2021 against RM2,255 per tonne recorded last year, said Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi (picture).\n\n\u201cKPDNHEP would like to clarify that the government still maintains the quota for subsidised cooking oil at 60,000 tonnes per month for 2020 and 2021 although the price of RBD palm olein has increased by 83% to RM4,122 per tonne in 2021 compared to RM2,255 per tonne in 2020.\n\n\u201cThis is equivalent to 60 million of 1kg polybag packets, allocated for each Malaysians, including in Sarawak and Sabah, and the government is committed to maintaining the allocation,\u201d he said in a statement yesterday.\n\nNanta Linggi added that should the price of vegetable cooking oil continue to increase, the government is expected to spend RM1.8 billion in subsidy, a hefty increase from RM400 million currently.\n\n\u201cIf the RBD palm olein price continues to show an upward trend, the subsidy cost for the scheme is expected to increase from RM400 million to RM1.8 billion.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the government\u2019s decision to maintain the quotas of the COSS programme indicates the level of commitment in reducing the cost of living and safeguarding the wellbeing of the people.\n\n\u201cThe KPDNHEP Enforcement Division has been conducting comprehensive audits regularly,\u201d he said.\n\nNanta Linggi was responding to a report by the local news portal, Borneo Post Online, claiming that there is a shortage of supply of subsidised cooking oil in the market.\n\nIn addressing the illegality of the distribution of subsidised cooking oil, the authorities had found a total of 318 cases from 2016 until March 2021, while the distribution quota for four companies had been cancelled.\n\nAccording to official data, there are 11 distributors for subsidised cooking oil under the COSS programme in Sarawak with a total quota of 3,067 tonnes.\n\nMeanwhile, on the sugar issue, Alexander said the domestic selling price is controlled at a maximum of RM2.85 per kg for coarse white sugar and RM2.95 per kg for refined white sugar.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the wholesale selling price of sugar used in the food and beverage (F&B) industry is set at RM2.77 per kg for coarse white sugar and RM2.85 per kg for refined white sugar,\u201d he said.\n\nTo widen the size of the supply chain of the sugar industry, Nanta Linggi said local F&B and wholesaler companies could apply for a permit to import refined sugar.\n\n\u201cEligible applications will be carefully considered by an Evaluation Committee represented by several relevant government agencies, including the International Trade and Industry Ministry, the Malaysian Industrial Investment Authority and the Royal Malaysian Customs Department.\n\n\u201cThe priority of issuing import permits is for the F&B manufacturing companies and wholesalers to meet the set evaluation criteria.\n\n\u201cA continuous monitoring will continue to be carried out on the permit recipients to prevent abuse and misappropriation and enforcement action will be imposed on any party who misuses the permit to import refined sugar,\u201d he said.", "keyword": ["sugar", "oil",

Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) has issued 84 notices against food and beverage premises operators nationwide for charging more than RM1 for a glass of plain water.\n\nIts Deputy Minister Datuk Rosol Wahid said all the notices were issued through Ops Catut 8.0 carried out since Wednesday (April 7) following complaints from the public.\n\n\u201cThe operation will be carried out until April 15 by enforcement teams nationwide. Based on the number of notices issued, we find that this is quite a common occurrence.\n\n\u201cThis should not happen... maybe a more appropriate price would be between RM0.20 or RM0.30,\u201c he told reporters after officiating the Terengganu state-level Franchise Bay Tour Programme here today.\n\nOf the 84 notices, Kelantan recorded the highest number with 14, followed by Selangor (12), Sabah (eight), Sarawak (eight), Johor (eight), Pahang (seven), Terengganu (six), Kuala Lumpur (five), Melaka (four), Federal Territory of Labuan (three), Penang (three), Perlis (two), Perak (two) and Negeri Sembilan (two).\n\nTraders who are issued with the notice will be given two to five working days to provide the information required by KPDNHEP before further action is taken in accordance with the Price Control and Anti -Profiteering Act 2011.\n\nMeanwhile, Rosol called on more franchisors to take advantage of the Micro and Affordable Franchise Development Programme to help create better opportunities for entrepreneurs, especially those in the B40 and M40 target groups.\n\nHe said there were currently 1,091 franchise brands registered in Malaysia, of which 694 were local franchise brands.\n\n\u201cHowever, so far only 12 franchise brands have offered micro franchises and affordable franchises. The number is still too small compared to the 1,091 registered franchise brands,\u201d he said.\n\nAffordable franchises are business packages worth RM100 thousand and below, while micro franchises are worth RM50 thousand and below.\n\nRosol said KPDNHEP had allocated a total of RM5 million for the Affordable and Micro Franchise Development Programme, comprising full grants worth RM2 million offered to franchisors, and matching grants totalling RM2.5 million for those from the B40 and M40 groups looking to open a franchise.\n\nOn an unrelated matter, Rosol, who is also Hulu Terengganu MP, said KPDNHEP was monitoring motorcycle sales activities around the Klang Valley, where customers were apparently finding it difficult to purchase new two-wheelers in cash.\n\n\u201cRecently I have received complaints from customers who say they find it difficult to buy motorcycles in cash, because sellers prefer customers to purchase them in installments.\n\n\u201cIf there are reports that traders are pressuring customers, KPDNHEP can investigate. There may be offences (committed) that we can take action against, especially if traders set different prices for the purchase of motorcycles in cash or monthly installments,\u201c he said.\n\nHe added that apart from keeping the people away from the burden of debt, he also did not want them to be saddled with interest payments.\n\n\u201cI think there may be an alliance between the motor companies and finance institutions... imagine if there is a charge of 5% or 8% in interest over five years, how much will they earn (compared to the cash deal) ... if there are two different prices according to the method of purchase, this is wrong,\u201c he said. \u2014 Bernama", "keyword": ["water", "issued", "priced", "84", "franchise", "terengganu", "micro", "nationwide", "glass", "plain", "notices", "kpdnhep", "franchises", "purchase", "issues", "customers", "rm1", "worth"], "summary": "KUALA TERENGGANU: The Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) has issued 84 notices against food and beverage premises operators nationwide for charging more than RM1 for a glass of plain water.\nBased on the number of notices issued, we find that this is quite a common occurrence.\n\u201cHowever, so far only 12 franchise brands have offered micro franchises and affordable franchises.\nAffordable franchises are business packages worth RM100 thousand and below, while micro franchises are worth RM50 thousand and below.\n\u201cIf there are reports that traders are pressuring customers, KPDNHEP can investigate.", "news": "The Sun Daily", "date": "2021-04-10 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Kelantan KPDNHEP seizes 800kg of flour sold without licence", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEPdxU7tI-7bms0z3UhdRH6kqGQgEKhAIACoHCAow9sveCjC0m9YBMPDtoQM?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/kpdnKel925_NSTfield_image_socialmedia.var_1618148048.jpg", "text": "", "keyword": ["flour", "licence", "seizes", "kpdnhep", "kelantan", "800kg", "sold"], "summary": "", "news": "New Straits Times", "date": "2021-04-11 00:00:00", "language": "INDONESIA"}, {"title": "Need Refund From Online Sellers Or Chicken Prices Too High?

increase in chicken prices in the market.\n\nIt said it had taken several actions to immediately address the issue, and had deployed a total of 176 enforcement officers from nine branches throughout the state to monitor and inspect various locations such as public markets, farmers\u2019 markets and supermarkets to ensure the supply and prices of essential goods, including chickens, are stable and adequate for the Ramadan month and Hari Raya Aidilfitri.\n\nIt further said according to the National Price Council Division (BHBN)of KPDNHEP Sarawak, the selling price of standard clean chicken from January to this month is between RM7.90 and RM8.80 per kg.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the price is at normal levels and does not show any unusual increase,\u201d it pointed out in a statement yesterday.\n\nAside from that, its enforcement team led by chief enforcement officer Mogan Arumugam the previous day had also conducted inspections at Medan Niaga Satok and several supermarkets around Petra Jaya here, including Pasaraya Mydin, Emart Matang and Everrise Matang, to monitor the situation and current supply and price of chicken in the market.\n\nThe inspection found that the supply of chicken was stable, sufficient and easily obtained at a price of around RM7.89 to RM8.80 per kg, it added.\n\nOn a related matter, it said the three main farms in Sarawak; namely K&L Farming Sdn Bhd, QL Livestock Farming Sdn Bhd and Central Cold Storage Kuching Sdn Bhd, had an average production of 57,360 birds/day which was sufficient to meet the needs of all the people in Sarawak.\n\n\u201cOur

maintaining a subsidised cooking oil quota of 60,000 tonnes per month despite the increase in the price of refined, bleached and deodorised (RBD) palm oil, says Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi (picture).\n\nThis is equivalent to 60 million one-kilogramme (kg) polybag packets, with 1.5 kg allocated for every Malaysian, including in Sabah and Sarawak.\n\nNanta said RBD palm oil increased by about 83 per cent to RM4,122 per tonne this year compared to RM2,255 per tonne in 2020.\n\n\u201cThe government has also increased the allocation based on a commitment to supply 60,000 tonnes although the price of RBD palm olein has gone up,\u201d he said, adding that the government expected the cost of the subsidy scheme to increase from RM400 million to RM1.8 billion if the price of RBD palm olein continued to rise.\n\n\u201cAs such, the government\u2019s decision to maintain the quota in the Cooking Oil Stabilisation Scheme (COSS) shows the government\u2019s high commitment to reduce the cost of living and ensure the well-being of the people,\u201d he said in a statement today.\n\nThe statement was issued following news reports on alleged shortage of subsidised cooking oil in Sarawak which stemmed from the dishonest action of cooking oil packaging companies of not supplying subsidised cooking oil in prescribed quantities for distribution to supermarkets and grocery stores.\n\nThe report also suggested that KPDNHEP step up monitoring and enforcement on subsidised cooking oil packaging activities and ensure that the RM400 million cooking oil subsidy allocation this year is spent prudently.\n\nNanta said KPDNHEP\u2019s enforcement division always conducted comprehensive audits to ensure that every subsidised cooking oil production was acceptable in each of its distribution chains.\n\nFollowing the audit and stern action in tackling the leakage of subsidised cooking oil distribution, Nanta said a total of 318 cases had been recorded nationwide from 2016 to March 2021.\n\nDuring the same period, four cooking oil packaging companies were taken to task by cancelling the quotas given to them earlier, he said.\n\nOn complaints related to cooking oil in Sarawak, Nanta said a review of records found that there had been 25 complaints since 2020 until March 31 (2021) and 4,221 inspections conducted on premises selling cooking oil until yesterday (April 12).\n\nOn the sugar issue which was also touched on in the news report, Nanta said in principle, the selling price of domestic sugar was controlled at a maximum price of RM2.85 per kg for coarse refined white sugar and RM2.95 per kg for refined white sugar for retail sale.\n\nThe wholesale selling price of sugar for use in the food and beverage (F&B) industry is set at RM2.77 per kg for coarse refined white sugar and RM2.85 per kg for refined white sugar.\n\n\u201cThe difference in lower sugar prices can be enjoyed by F&B companies based on the quantity and method of purchase agreed upon with the supplier, and also depending on the price of raw sugar in the world market without government intervention,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the news report, the F&B industry now has to spend more to get refined sugar at RM2.75 per kg.\n\nNanta said local F&B companies and wholesalers could apply for permits to import refined sugar at any time of the year.\n\n\u201cEligible applications will be carefully considered by an evaluation committee represented by several relevant government agencies including the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, the Malaysian Investment Development Authority and the Royal Malaysian Customs Department, he said.\n\n\u201cThe priority of issuing import permits is to any F&B manufacturing company and wholesaler that meets the evaluation criteria set,\u201d he added.\n\nNanta said continuous monitoring would be carried out on the recipients of permits to import refined sugar to prevent misuse and misappropriation, and enforcement action would be taken against those who misused the permits to import refined sugar.", "keyword": ["sugar", "oil", "month", "fb", "white", "subsidised", "remains",

yesterday claimed that there is a shortage of subsidised 1kg pack of cooking oil due to under-production by some repackers who have been receiving government subsidies.\n\nThe former deputy minister of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) said the government had allocated RM400 million for the cooking oil price stabilisation scheme this year alone to enable the needy across Malaysia to buy the subsidised cooking oil at RM2.50.\n\n\u201cEvery year, there is government allocation to maintain the price of the 1kg subsidised cooking oil at RM2.50. The allocation for this year is RM400 million and it was also RM400 million last year.\n\n\u201cWhen PH (Pakatan Harapan) was the government, the allocation was RM720 million in 2018 and RM600 million in 2019. During our time, we made sure all this amount go to packing the subsidised cooking oil. But lately I noticed that there is a huge shortage of this 1kg cooking oil,\u201d he said during his Facebook live in e-Mart Batu Kawa here.\n\nChong, who is Stampin MP and Kota Sentosa assemblyman, claimed that some repackers had resorted to over-claiming of subsidies or under-production of subsidised cooking oil.\n\nFor instance, he said a repacker who was supposed to pack 1,500kg of cooking oil only packed 1,000kg but still claimed the subsidy amount for 1,500kg.\n\n\u201cDuring PH\u2019s time, it\u2019s very seldom that you didn\u2019t get the 1kg cooking oil in the market. But after PH is no longer the government, most of the time you can\u2019t get this 1kg cooking oil.\n\n\u201cWhy? I believe the hanky panky thing has found its way back to the system. That\u2019s why we are having this Facebook live to forewarn the government,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also called upon his former colleagues at KPDNHEP to carry out strict enforcement to ensure a stable supply of the subsidised cooking oil.\n\nWhen he was the deputy KPDNHEP minister, Chong said they kept a record of the volume repackers delivered to the retailers, who must then have a record for the ministry to cross check.\n\nWith such strict enforcement, he said the government would be able to make sure that the allocation could benefit the target groups.\n\n\u201cI think the situation is quite bad now, a lot of time you can\u2019t find the 1kg cooking oil. After all, it\u2019s RM400 million of government allocation we are talking about.\u201d\n\nChong said the previous PH government managed to bring down the price of sugar to RM1.70 or RM1.80 per kg for food and beverages (F&B) manufacturers but today, they had to fork out RM2.75 per kg.\n\nHe added that the former federal government opened up sugar import for F&B manufacturers in Sarawak.\n\nHe was glad that the current federal government had carried on the policy but some F&B manufacturers in the state had complained that their applications for sugar import had been rejected by Putrajaya.\n\n\u201c(KPDNHEP Minister Datuk) Alexandar Nanta Linggi is a Sarawakian. He can do much better than what I did as a deputy minister since he is a full minister.\n\n\u201cI will talk to Alexandar Nanta and ask him to make it easier for F&B manufacturers in Sarawak to apply for the sugar import permit,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier, Chong handed out shopping vouchers worth RM100 to about 40 needy individuals under a social programme in collaboration with e-Mart Batu Kawa to

introduced 20 initiatives since 2020 to help companies and entrepreneurs reduce the impact of Covid-19 in their businesses.\n\nOf these initiatives, three of them were also announced in the Pemerkasa agenda.\n\nSSM\u2019s first initiative in Pemerkasa was to increase the current threshold value of indebtedness under Section 466 of the Companies Act 2016 from RM10,000 to RM50,000 until Dec 31, 2020, along with the period to respond to a notice of claim by a company was also extended to six months.\n\n\u201cTaking into account the uncertainties in the global and domestic economic conditions following the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, SSM has also announced that the company\u2019s indebtedness threshold was raised to RM50,000 effective April 1, 2021, as a new permanent threshold value,\u201d said Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi in his speech during SSM\u2019s 19th Anniversary Ceremony in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.\n\nThe second initiative offers free business registration facilities to B40 group entrepreneurs and full -time IPT students who wish to venture into entrepreneurship while the third initiative was offering assistance to the disabled to register and renew their business with SSM for free.\n\nHe added SSM remains committed to helping ease the burden of the business community by implementing initiatives to extend the compound exemption for delays in renewing business registrations and delays in registering new businesses under the Business Registration Act 1956 until Dec 31 this year which will benefit over 330,000 business communities.\n\nThe minister announced this initiative on March 30, as an extension of the implementation of the compound exemption for delays in renewing business registration certificates implemented from March 17 \u2013 Dec 31, 2020, before being extended until June 30 this year.\n\nIn the same event he said SSM has spent a total of RM3.6 million in corporate zakat

1956 which applies in Peninsular Malaysia and the Federal Territory of Labuan or under the Companies Act 2016 and the Limited Liability Partnership Act 2012.\n\nThrough this campaign, SSM calls on all

I have very little information on her and her family as my mother would not want to share much on her sister who was \u2018given away\u2019 or maybe she really didn\u2019t know much about them as she was from another mother,\u201d Sim explained.\n\n\u201cThen 21 years ago we managed to meet up for the first time. Then Toh Puan Sri had just married Tun Pehin Sri Salahuddin. Suddenly our family size grew following the meeting for the first time between Toh Puan Sri and my mum, since their birth.\u201d\n\nAlthough Norkiah was given up for adoption to a Malay family back in the early 50s, when the situations in those days were tough with some households having more than 10 children, it was not unusual for families to give away their children (particularly girls) to young couples who were not able to conceive their own, he said.\n\n\u201cA few months after the family meeting, Tun Pehin Sri Salahuddin was appointed as the Governor of Sarawak again (for the second time) and my late auntie\u2019s life took a huge change. Her role changed drastically from a loving wife to Tun, but was elevated to First Lady of Sarawak.\n\n\u201cThe late Toh Puan Sri was fortunate because her life story would become one that is reminiscent of the Cinderella story when she met, fell in love and married Tun Pehin Sri. She was Tun Pehin Sri\u2019s second wife after his first wife had passed away,\u201d Sim added.\n\n\u201cShe was born into a poor Chinese family and given away to an equally poor Malay family and like Cinderella she ended up happy ever after in the Astana of Sarawak as the First Lady of Sarawak.\n\n\u201cShe made sure that her years as First Lady were not wasted. She started her charity works, helped and touched so many lives like the orphans, elderly and the poor. She was generous, approachable, down to earth and putting others first.\u201d\n\nSince then, she had dedicated her life to the wellbeing of others, playing her role as the mother to all Sarawakians regardless of race or creed, Sim added.\n\n(For the freshest news, join our Telegram channel)\n\n\u201cIndeed Toh Puan\u2019s life is part and parcel of Sarawak\u2019s story. Hers is similar to that of Datin Amar Dato Hajjah Juma\u2019ani Tuanku Haji Bujang, wife of the Chief Minister (Datuk Patinggi Abang Johari Tun Openg), who was also adopted by a Muslim family from a Chinese family.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy aunty and Tun Pehin Sri had brought much peace, harmony and unity of all Sarawakians. They would be joining my activities by lending their support especially during Inter-cultural Mooncake festival. They would not miss any of the annual celebrations held at Carpenter Street. They would grace dinner functions hosted by many associations that me and my late father Datuk Sim Swee Yong were involved in. Their show of love for all Sarawakians irrespective of race and religion is what makes us and Sarawakians unique and special,\u201d added Sim.\n\n\u201cShe was a shining example of our unity in diversity.

Instead, let the interministerial discussion happen, then formulate a pricing index and monitor it.\n\n\u201cMake a one-year action plan, not only for festive season. Run it for a year, check every month (whether it is) working or not. If something is wrong, solve it,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve (TMR).\n\nGeorge, with 45 years of experience addressing public interest issues, said the government is not engaging consumer groups to handle the problem.\n\nHe said price hike will change consumers\u2019 purchasing patterns which activate the panic buying mode where people buy more and impact the distribution chain.\n\n\u201cThe government needs to set a competent task force with intelligent members to sit with policymakers, so they can advise the ministers after being on the ground on a plan of action that can be rolled out to address the issue.\n\n\u201cTo come out with realistic costs, we have to make sure people on the ground or people in the marketplace are not profiteering,\u201d he added.\n\nGeorge said he was part of a task force which was set up before the last election, but the committee didn\u2019t get off the ground with the change in government.\n\nMeanwhile, Federation of Malaysian Consumers Associations (Fomca) CEO Datuk Dr Paul Selvaraj said increases in prices are not just an immediate problem, but caused by investment in agriculture and supply chain competitiveness.\n\nHe said a lot of production is still dependent on imports and when the prices go up in the international market, the country gets affected.\n\n\u201cFomca always advocates moving forward self-sufficiency so that we are not impacted by world trade or problems from other markets.\n\n\u201cWe neglect the agriculture sector and do not beat up the demand of our modern economy. We still import beef, fish and vegetables,\u201d he told TMR.\n\nHe said Malaysia needs to shift focus to agriculture production by maintaining a vibrant industry, not only for production purposes, but also to attract new generations.\n\n\u201cTo make it attractive, it must be viable and (can) provide a good income. In other countries, developing sustainable agriculture is a major stake. Why can\u2019t we do that?\u201d he added.\n\nHe also said the Malaysia Competition Commission did a market surveillance on food and they found that along the supply chain, there is a lot of market manipulation that gets people together and manipulates prices.\n\nWhile conducting the survey, \u201cthey also identified a long supply chain where the market manipulation is going on. Monopolistic behaviour makes consumers suffer\u201d.\n\n\u201cSince the information is there and a survey has been done, the government should take action towards these people who take advantage of profit gearing. It should be a continuing enforcement,\u201d he said.\n\nMalaysian Muslim Consumers Association lead activist Datuk Nadzim Johan said the government does not really play their role to address the increasing prices of essential items.\n\n\u201cIt is a big challenge, but we have an option actually. But we chose the wrong way. Why do we have to buy chillies from Thailand at RM26 per kg?\n\n\u201cOur agriculture is still lagging. Why don\u2019t we plant those vegetables ourselves?\u201d he told TMR.\n\nNadzim said the current state of Emergency needs to end immediately to tackle this issue which can lead to serious problems, such as unemployment, suicide and high debt.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the Emergency is necessary in the first place.

Najib has no privity of contract with the bank,\u201d he said.\n\nSithambaram, who was given a special licence by the attorney-general to prosecute Najib\u2019s SRC International corruption case, said \u201cthe defence has to respond to the prosecution\u2019s case on the seven charges\u201d faced by the former prime minister.\n\n\u201cThe issue of forged or unauthorised scan (of signatures) and electronic transfer is a non-starter, especially for the criminal breach of trust charges.\n\n\u201cThe issue raised is a red herring by the defence, and who would have the audacity to fix a then sitting prime minister?\u201d he asked.\n\nHe said SRC did not sue the bank for negligence or asked the financial institution to pay back the money.\n\n\u201cNo company will keep quiet if there is no proper authorisation and withdrawal of money.\u201d\n\nSithambaram said there was evidence that the SRC directors had authorised the bank to conduct electronic transfers and the bank said it had also acted based on the mandate of SRC signatories.\n\nIn fact, he said, Najib had not returned the RM42 million although he had admitted receiving the money that belonged to SRC.\n\n\u201cHe only said (he did not have) knowledge of how the money came in but we have proven the RM42 million went into his accounts,\u201d he said, adding that the prosecution was raising this issue as \u201cwe want to take the bull by the horns\u201d.\n\nNajib\u2019s lead counsel, Muhammad Shafee Abdullah, had said last week the prosecution\u2019s case would have collapsed if the evidence of one of the signatories and then SRC directors, Suboh Md Yassin, was rejected by the High Court as he had made contradictory statements.\n\nSuboh had said he had at first told Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) investigators who met him in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates on Nov 17, 2015, that the 13 signatures in the electronic fund transfer instructions to the bank were genuine.\n\nHowever, he said while being cross-examined by Shafee, he told MACC officers in Putrajaya on May 28 and 30, 2018 that his signatures could have been forged.\n\nSuboh also said he once again told MACC officers on Aug 13 and 15, 2018 that the signatures were genuine.\n\nThe defence had suggested that former SRC chief executive officer Nik Faisal Ariff Kamil could have \u201cphotoshopped\u201d (digitally manipulated) Suboh\u2019s signature in the scanned copies before sending them to the bank to carry out the instructions to transfer funds.\n\nShafee had also suggested that Nik Faisal, who has gone missing, had forged and misused Suboh\u2019s signature and put it in the hard copies.\n\nNik Faisal and Suboh were the signatories of the SRC account from which money was transferred to Gandingan Mentari, a subsidiary of SRC.\n\nThey were also signatories of the Gandingan Mentari account, where money was transferred to Ihsan Perdana, a company selected to carry out corporate social responsibility programmes for SRC.\n\nThe prosecution contends that RM42 million from Ihsan Perdana was transferred to Najib\u2019s three Ambank accounts at the Jalan Raja Chulan branch through a \u201clayering process\u201d to conceal its origin.\n\nTrial judge Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali sentenced Najib in July last year to 12 years\u2019 jail and ordered him to pay a RM210 million fine after finding him guilty on the seven counts of abuse of power, criminal breach of trust and money laundering in relation to the RM42 million belonging to SRC.\n\nHe is appealing against his conviction and

optimisation, among others\n\nBy NUR HANANI AZMAN\n\nTHE possible merger between Celcom Axiata Bhd and DiGi.com Bhd would allow the combined entity to better compete in the 5G environment via scale, improved balance sheet and operational execution.\n\nWith 5G services offered via a wholesale arrangement (5G special purpose vehicle), mobile operators no longer need to spend heavily on capital expenditure (capex) but instead focus on price and branding, said RHB Investment Bank Bhd analyst Jeffrey Tan.\n\n\u201cConsolidation would, however, see the number of operators reduced and by extension, result in lesser competition,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve.\n\nOn April 8, Axiata Group Bhd and Telenor Asia Pte Ltd announced that they are in advanced discussions on the potential merger of Celcom and Digi, with the joint entity to be known as Celcom Digi Bhd or MergeCo.\n\nAxiata and Digi will have an equal stake of about 33.1% each in MergeCo, while Axiata together with local institutional funds will own over 51% of MergeCo.\n\nThe merged entity would have a combined 19.1 million customers and total revenue of RM12.4 billion.\n\nWhether this merger fails or succeeds, Jeffrey said it is imperative for mobile operators to consider the longer-term sustainability of the industry and to collaborate in ways to ensure their continued existence in the face of digitalisation.\n\n\u201cThere are lower execution risks with this proposal in that the scope of the merger is significantly smaller and national interests are taken into consideration,\u201d he

to spend RM1.8b in subsidy\n\nby SHAHEERA AZNAM SHAH / pic by RAZAK GHAZALI\n\nTHE Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) is maintaining the monthly quota for subsidised cooking oil through the Cooking Oil Stabilisation Scheme (COSS) at 60,000 tonnes amid the spike in the refined bleached and deodorised (RBD) palm olein price this year.\n\nThe price of vegetable cooking oil has surged 83% to RM4,122 per tonne in 2021 against RM2,255 per tonne recorded last year, said Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi (picture).\n\n\u201cKPDNHEP would like to clarify that the government still maintains the quota for subsidised cooking oil at 60,000 tonnes per month for 2020 and 2021 although the price of RBD palm olein has increased by 83% to RM4,122 per tonne in 2021 compared to RM2,255 per tonne in 2020.\n\n\u201cThis is equivalent to 60 million of 1kg polybag packets, allocated for each Malaysians, including in Sarawak and Sabah, and the government is committed to maintaining the allocation,\u201d he said in a statement yesterday.\n\nNanta Linggi added that should the price of vegetable cooking oil continue to increase, the government is expected to spend RM1.8 billion in subsidy, a hefty increase from RM400 million currently.\n\n\u201cIf the RBD palm olein price continues to show an upward trend, the subsidy cost for the scheme is expected to increase from RM400 million to RM1.8 billion.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the government\u2019s decision to maintain the quotas of the COSS programme indicates the level of commitment in reducing the cost of living and safeguarding the wellbeing of the people.\n\n\u201cThe KPDNHEP Enforcement Division has been conducting comprehensive audits regularly,\u201d he said.\n\nNanta Linggi was responding to a report by the local news portal, Borneo Post Online, claiming that there is a shortage of supply of subsidised cooking oil in the market.\n\nIn addressing the illegality of the distribution of subsidised

Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) has issued 84 notices against food and beverage premises operators nationwide for charging more than RM1 for a glass of plain water.\n\nIts Deputy Minister Datuk Rosol Wahid said all the notices were issued through Ops Catut 8.0 carried out since Wednesday (April 7) following complaints from the public.\n\n\u201cThe operation will be carried out until April 15 by enforcement teams nationwide. Based on the number of notices issued, we find that this is quite a common occurrence.\n\n\u201cThis should not happen... maybe a more appropriate price would be between RM0.20 or RM0.30,\u201c he told reporters after officiating the Terengganu state-level Franchise Bay Tour Programme here today.\n\nOf the 84 notices, Kelantan recorded the highest number with 14, followed by Selangor (12), Sabah (eight), Sarawak (eight), Johor (eight), Pahang (seven), Terengganu (six), Kuala Lumpur (five), Melaka (four), Federal Territory of Labuan (three), Penang (three), Perlis (two), Perak (two) and Negeri Sembilan (two).\n\nTraders who are issued with the notice will be given two to five working days to provide the information required by KPDNHEP before further action is taken in accordance with the Price Control and Anti -Profiteering Act 2011.\n\nMeanwhile, Rosol called on more franchisors to take advantage of the Micro and Affordable Franchise Development Programme to help create better opportunities for entrepreneurs, especially those in the B40 and M40 target groups.\n\nHe said there were currently 1,091 franchise brands registered in Malaysia, of which 694 were local franchise brands.\n\n\u201cHowever, so far only 12 franchise brands have offered micro franchises and affordable franchises. The number is still too small compared to the 1,091 registered franchise brands,\u201d he said.\n\nAffordable franchises are business packages worth RM100 thousand and below, while micro franchises are worth RM50 thousand and below.\n\nRosol said KPDNHEP had allocated a total of RM5 million for the Affordable and Micro Franchise Development Programme, comprising full grants worth RM2 million offered to franchisors, and matching grants totalling RM2.5 million for those from the B40 and M40 groups looking to open a franchise.\n\nOn an unrelated matter, Rosol, who is also Hulu Terengganu MP, said KPDNHEP was monitoring motorcycle sales activities around the Klang Valley, where customers were apparently finding it difficult to purchase new two-wheelers in cash.\n\n\u201cRecently I have received complaints from customers who say they find it difficult to buy motorcycles in cash, because sellers prefer customers to purchase them in installments.\n\n\u201cIf there are reports that traders are pressuring customers, KPDNHEP can investigate. There may be offences (committed) that we can take action against, especially if traders set different prices for the purchase of motorcycles in cash or monthly installments,\u201c he said.\n\nHe added that apart from keeping the people away from the burden of debt, he also did not want them to be saddled with interest payments.\n\n\u201cI think there may be an alliance between the motor companies and finance institutions... imagine if there is a charge of 5% or 8% in interest over five years, how much will they earn (compared to the cash deal) ... if there are two different prices according to the method of purchase, this is wrong,\u201c he said. \u2014 Bernama", "keyword": ["water", "issued", "priced", "84", "franchise", "terengganu", "micro", "nationwide", "glass", "plain", "notices", "kpdnhep", "franchises", "purchase", "issues", "customers", "rm1", "worth"], "summary": "KUALA TERENGGANU: The Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) has issued 84 notices against food and beverage premises operators nationwide for charging more than RM1 for a glass of plain water.\nBased on the number of notices issued, we find that this is quite a common occurrence.\n\u201cHowever, so far only 12 franchise brands have offered micro franchises and affordable franchises.\nAffordable franchises are business packages worth RM100 thousand and below, while micro franchises are worth RM50 thousand and below.\n\u201cIf there are reports that traders are pressuring customers, KPDNHEP can investigate.", "news": "The Sun Daily", "date": "2021-04-10 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Kelantan KPDNHEP seizes 800kg of flour sold without licence", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEPdxU7tI-7bms0z3UhdRH6kqGQgEKhAIACoHCAow9sveCjC0m9YBMPDtoQM?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/kpdnKel925_NSTfield_image_socialmedia.var_1618148048.jpg", "text": "", "keyword": ["flour", "licence", "seizes", "kpdnhep", "kelantan", "800kg", "sold"], "summary": "", "news": "New Straits Times", "date": "2021-04-11 00:00:00", "language": "INDONESIA"}, {"title": "Need Refund From Online Sellers Or Chicken Prices Too High?

the state to monitor and inspect various locations such as public markets, farmers\u2019 markets and supermarkets to ensure the supply and prices of essential goods, including chickens, are stable and adequate for the Ramadan month and Hari Raya Aidilfitri.\n\nIt further said according to the National Price Council Division (BHBN)of KPDNHEP Sarawak, the selling price of standard clean chicken from January to this month is between RM7.90 and RM8.80 per kg.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the price is at normal levels and does not show any unusual increase,\u201d it pointed out in a statement

maintaining a subsidised cooking oil quota of 60,000 tonnes per month despite the increase in the price of refined, bleached and deodorised (RBD) palm oil, says Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi (picture).\n\nThis is equivalent to 60 million one-kilogramme (kg) polybag packets, with 1.5 kg allocated for every Malaysian, including in Sabah and Sarawak.\n\nNanta said RBD palm oil increased by about 83 per cent to RM4,122 per tonne this year compared to RM2,255 per tonne in 2020.\n\n\u201cThe government has also increased the allocation based on a commitment to supply 60,000 tonnes although the price of RBD palm olein has gone up,\u201d he said, adding that the government expected the cost of the subsidy scheme to increase from RM400 million to RM1.8 billion if the price of RBD palm olein continued to rise.\n\n\u201cAs such, the government\u2019s decision to maintain the quota in the Cooking Oil Stabilisation Scheme (COSS) shows the government\u2019s high commitment to reduce the cost of living and ensure the well-being of the people,\u201d he said in a statement today.\n\nThe statement was issued following news reports on alleged shortage of subsidised cooking oil in Sarawak which stemmed from the dishonest action of cooking oil packaging companies of not supplying subsidised cooking oil in prescribed quantities for distribution to supermarkets and grocery stores.\n\nThe report also suggested that KPDNHEP step up monitoring and enforcement on subsidised cooking oil packaging activities and ensure that the RM400 million cooking oil subsidy allocation this year is spent prudently.\n\nNanta said KPDNHEP\u2019s enforcement division always conducted comprehensive audits to ensure that every subsidised cooking oil production was acceptable in each of its distribution chains.\n\nFollowing the audit and stern action in tackling the leakage of subsidised cooking oil distribution, Nanta said a total of 318 cases had been recorded nationwide from 2016 to March 2021.\n\nDuring the same period, four cooking oil packaging companies were taken to task by cancelling the quotas given to them earlier, he said.\n\nOn complaints related to cooking oil in Sarawak, Nanta said a review of records found that there had been 25 complaints since 2020 until March 31 (2021) and 4,221 inspections conducted on premises selling cooking oil until yesterday (April 12).\n\nOn the sugar issue which was also touched on in the news report, Nanta said in principle, the selling price of domestic sugar was controlled at a maximum price of RM2.85 per kg for coarse refined white sugar and RM2.95 per kg for refined white sugar for retail sale.\n\nThe wholesale selling price of sugar for use in the food and beverage (F&B) industry is set at RM2.77 per kg for coarse refined white sugar and RM2.85 per kg for refined white sugar.\n\n\u201cThe difference in lower sugar prices can be enjoyed by F&B companies based on the quantity and method of purchase agreed upon with the supplier, and also depending on the price of raw sugar in the world market without government intervention,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the news report, the F&B industry now has to spend more to get refined sugar at RM2.75 per kg.\n\nNanta said local F&B companies and wholesalers could apply for permits to import refined sugar at any time of the year.\n\n\u201cEligible applications will be carefully considered by an evaluation committee represented by several relevant government agencies including the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, the Malaysian Investment Development Authority and the Royal Malaysian Customs Department, he said.\n\n\u201cThe priority of issuing import permits is to any F&B manufacturing company and wholesaler that meets the evaluation criteria set,\u201d he added.\n\nNanta said continuous monitoring would be carried out on the recipients of permits to import refined sugar to prevent misuse and misappropriation, and enforcement action would be taken against those who misused the permits to import refined sugar.", "keyword": ["sugar", "oil", "month", "fb", "white", "subsidised", "remains",

yesterday claimed that there is a shortage of subsidised 1kg pack of cooking oil due to under-production by some repackers who have been receiving government subsidies.\n\nThe former deputy minister of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) said the government had allocated RM400 million for the cooking oil price stabilisation scheme this year alone to enable the needy across Malaysia to buy the subsidised cooking oil at RM2.50.\n\n\u201cEvery year, there is government allocation to maintain the price of the 1kg subsidised cooking oil at RM2.50. The allocation for this year is RM400 million and it was also RM400 million last year.\n\n\u201cWhen PH (Pakatan Harapan) was the government, the allocation was RM720 million in 2018 and RM600 million in 2019. During our time, we made sure all this amount go to packing the subsidised cooking oil. But lately I noticed that there is a huge shortage of this 1kg cooking oil,\u201d he said during his Facebook live in e-Mart Batu Kawa here.\n\nChong, who is Stampin MP and Kota Sentosa assemblyman, claimed that some repackers had resorted to over-claiming of subsidies or under-production of subsidised cooking oil.\n\nFor instance, he said a repacker who was supposed to pack 1,500kg of cooking oil only packed 1,000kg but still claimed the subsidy amount for 1,500kg.\n\n\u201cDuring PH\u2019s time, it\u2019s very seldom that you didn\u2019t get the 1kg cooking oil in the market. But after PH is no longer the government, most of the time you can\u2019t get this 1kg cooking oil.\n\n\u201cWhy? I believe the hanky panky thing has found its way back to the system. That\u2019s why we are having this Facebook live to forewarn the government,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also called upon his former colleagues at KPDNHEP to carry out strict enforcement to ensure a stable supply of the subsidised cooking oil.\n\nWhen he was the deputy KPDNHEP minister, Chong said they kept a record of the volume repackers delivered to the retailers, who must then have a record for the ministry to cross check.\n\nWith such strict enforcement, he said the government would be able to make sure that the allocation could benefit the target groups.\n\n\u201cI think the situation is quite bad now, a lot of time you can\u2019t find the 1kg cooking oil. After all, it\u2019s RM400 million of government allocation we are talking about.\u201d\n\nChong said the previous PH government managed to bring down the price of sugar to RM1.70 or RM1.80 per kg for food and beverages (F&B) manufacturers but today, they had to fork out RM2.75 per kg.\n\nHe added that the former federal government opened up sugar import for F&B manufacturers in Sarawak.\n\nHe was glad that the current federal government had carried on the policy but some F&B manufacturers in the state had complained that their applications for sugar import had been rejected by Putrajaya.\n\n\u201c(KPDNHEP Minister Datuk) Alexandar Nanta Linggi is a Sarawakian. He can do much better than what I did as a deputy minister since he is a full minister.\n\n\u201cI will talk to Alexandar Nanta and ask him to make it easier for F&B manufacturers in Sarawak to apply for the sugar import permit,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier, Chong handed out shopping vouchers worth RM100 to about 40 needy individuals under a social programme in collaboration with e-Mart Batu Kawa to

introduced 20 initiatives since 2020 to help companies and entrepreneurs reduce the impact of Covid-19 in their businesses.\n\nOf these initiatives, three of them were also announced in the Pemerkasa agenda.\n\nSSM\u2019s first initiative in Pemerkasa was to increase the current threshold value of indebtedness under Section 466 of the Companies Act 2016 from RM10,000 to RM50,000 until Dec 31, 2020, along with the period to respond to a notice of claim by a company was also extended to six months.\n\n\u201cTaking into account the uncertainties in the global and domestic economic conditions following the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, SSM has also announced that the company\u2019s indebtedness threshold was raised to RM50,000 effective April 1, 2021, as a new permanent threshold value,\u201d said Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi in his speech during SSM\u2019s 19th Anniversary Ceremony in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.\n\nThe second initiative offers free business registration facilities to B40 group entrepreneurs and full -time IPT students who wish to venture into entrepreneurship while the third initiative was offering assistance to the disabled to register and renew their business with SSM for free.\n\nHe added SSM remains committed to helping ease the burden of the business community by implementing initiatives to extend the compound exemption for delays in renewing business registrations and delays in registering new businesses under the Business Registration Act 1956 until Dec 31 this year which will benefit over 330,000 business communities.\n\nThe minister announced this initiative on March 30, as an extension of the implementation of the compound exemption for delays in renewing business registration certificates implemented from March 17 \u2013 Dec 31, 2020, before being extended until June 30 this year.\n\nIn the same event he said SSM has spent a total of RM3.6 million in corporate zakat allocation and RM242,500 in corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives in 2020.\n\n\u201cI hope that SSM will be more successful in the future and be able to continue this noble endeavour,\u201d he added.\n\nSSM also launched the \u2018Usahawan Bijak, Usahawan Berdaftar\u2019 campaign that aims to produce ethical and trusted entrepreneurs and will be implemented throughout 2021.\n\nThe campaign is one of the methods to encourage the public, especially traders to register businesses.\n\nAll businesses need to register with SSM either under the Business Registration Act 1956 which applies in Peninsular Malaysia and the Federal Territory of Labuan or under the Companies Act 2016 and the Limited Liability Partnership Act 2012.\n\nThrough this campaign, SSM calls on all

I have very little information on her and her family as my mother would not want to share much on her sister who was \u2018given away\u2019 or maybe she really didn\u2019t know much about them as she was from another mother,\u201d Sim explained.\n\n\u201cThen 21 years ago we managed to meet up for the first time. Then Toh Puan Sri had just married Tun Pehin Sri Salahuddin. Suddenly our family size grew following the meeting for the first time between Toh Puan Sri and my mum, since their birth.\u201d\n\nAlthough Norkiah was given up for adoption to a Malay family back in the early 50s, when the situations in those days were tough with some households having more than 10 children, it was not unusual for families to give away their children (particularly girls) to young couples who were not able to conceive their own, he said.\n\n\u201cA few months after the family meeting, Tun Pehin Sri Salahuddin was appointed as the Governor of Sarawak again (for the second time) and my late auntie\u2019s life took a huge change. Her role changed drastically from a loving wife to Tun, but was elevated to First Lady of Sarawak.\n\n\u201cThe late Toh Puan Sri was fortunate because her life story would become one that is reminiscent of the Cinderella story when she met, fell in love and married Tun Pehin Sri. She was Tun Pehin Sri\u2019s second wife after his first wife had passed away,\u201d Sim added.\n\n\u201cShe was born into a poor Chinese family and given away to an equally poor Malay family and like Cinderella she ended up happy ever after in the Astana of Sarawak as the First Lady of Sarawak.\n\n\u201cShe made sure that her years as First Lady were not wasted. She started her charity works, helped and touched so many lives like the orphans, elderly and the poor. She was generous, approachable, down to earth and putting others first.\u201d\n\nSince then, she had dedicated her life to the wellbeing of others, playing her role as the mother to all Sarawakians regardless of race or creed, Sim added.\n\n(For the freshest news, join our Telegram channel)\n\n\u201cIndeed Toh Puan\u2019s life is part and parcel of Sarawak\u2019s story. Hers is similar to that of Datin Amar Dato Hajjah Juma\u2019ani Tuanku Haji Bujang, wife of the Chief Minister (Datuk Patinggi Abang Johari Tun Openg), who was also adopted by a Muslim family from a Chinese family.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy aunty and Tun Pehin Sri had brought much peace, harmony and unity of all Sarawakians. They would be joining my activities by lending their support especially during Inter-cultural Mooncake festival. They would not miss any of the annual celebrations held at Carpenter Street. They would grace dinner functions hosted by many associations that me and my late father Datuk Sim Swee Yong were involved in. Their show of love for all Sarawakians irrespective of race and religion is what makes us and Sarawakians unique and special,\u201d added Sim.\n\n\u201cShe was a shining example of our unity in diversity. Her upbringing in a Muslim and Malay family is very typical of our Sarawakian lifestyle in the early 50s and 60s when children were given for adoption due to poverty. This priceless practice is the saving grace of our bond and unity of all races in Sarawak.

Instead, let the interministerial discussion happen, then formulate a pricing index and monitor it.\n\n\u201cMake a one-year action plan, not only for festive season. Run it for a year, check every month (whether it is) working or not. If something is wrong, solve it,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve (TMR).\n\nGeorge, with 45 years of experience addressing public interest issues, said the government is not engaging consumer groups to handle the problem.\n\nHe said price hike will change consumers\u2019 purchasing patterns which activate the panic buying mode where people buy more and impact the distribution chain.\n\n\u201cThe government needs to set a competent task force with intelligent members to sit with policymakers, so they can advise the ministers after being on the ground on a plan of action that can be rolled out to address the issue.\n\n\u201cTo come out with realistic costs, we have to make sure people on the ground or people in the marketplace are not profiteering,\u201d he added.\n\nGeorge said he was part of a task force which was set up before the last election, but the committee didn\u2019t get off the ground with the change in government.\n\nMeanwhile, Federation of Malaysian Consumers Associations (Fomca) CEO Datuk Dr Paul Selvaraj said increases in prices are not just an immediate problem, but caused by investment in agriculture and supply chain competitiveness.\n\nHe said a lot of production is still dependent on imports and when the prices go up in the international market, the country gets affected.\n\n\u201cFomca always advocates moving forward self-sufficiency so that we are not impacted by world trade or problems from other markets.\n\n\u201cWe neglect the agriculture sector and do not beat up the demand of our modern economy. We still import beef, fish and vegetables,\u201d he told TMR.\n\nHe said Malaysia needs to shift focus to agriculture production by maintaining a vibrant industry, not only for production purposes, but also to attract new generations.\n\n\u201cTo make it attractive, it must be viable and (can) provide a good income. In other countries, developing sustainable agriculture is a major stake. Why can\u2019t we do that?\u201d he added.\n\nHe also said the Malaysia Competition Commission did a market surveillance on food and they found that along the supply chain, there is a lot of market manipulation that gets people together and manipulates prices.\n\nWhile conducting the survey, \u201cthey also identified a long supply chain where the market manipulation is going on. Monopolistic behaviour makes consumers suffer\u201d.\n\n\u201cSince the information is there and a survey has been done, the government should take action towards these people who take advantage of profit gearing. It should be a continuing enforcement,\u201d he said.\n\nMalaysian Muslim Consumers Association lead activist Datuk Nadzim Johan said the government does not really play their role to address the increasing prices of essential items.\n\n\u201cIt is a big challenge, but we have an option actually. But we chose the wrong way. Why do we have to buy chillies from Thailand at RM26 per kg?\n\n\u201cOur agriculture is still lagging. Why don\u2019t we plant those vegetables ourselves?\u201d he told TMR.\n\nNadzim said the current state of Emergency needs to end immediately to tackle this issue which can lead to serious problems, such as unemployment, suicide and high debt.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the Emergency is necessary in the first place.

Najib has no privity of contract with the bank,\u201d he said.\n\nSithambaram, who was given a special licence by the attorney-general to prosecute Najib\u2019s SRC International corruption case, said \u201cthe defence has to respond to the prosecution\u2019s case on the seven charges\u201d faced by the former prime minister.\n\n\u201cThe issue of forged or unauthorised scan (of signatures) and electronic transfer is a non-starter, especially for the criminal breach of trust charges.\n\n\u201cThe issue raised is a red herring by the defence, and who would have the audacity to fix a then sitting prime minister?\u201d he asked.\n\nHe said SRC did not sue the bank for negligence or asked the financial institution to pay back the money.\n\n\u201cNo company will keep quiet if there is no proper authorisation and withdrawal of money.\u201d\n\nSithambaram said there was evidence that the SRC directors had authorised the bank to conduct electronic transfers and the bank said it had also acted based on the mandate of SRC signatories.\n\nIn fact, he said, Najib had not returned the RM42 million although he had admitted receiving the money that belonged to SRC.\n\n\u201cHe only said (he did not have) knowledge of how the money came in but we have proven the RM42 million went into his accounts,\u201d he said, adding that the prosecution was raising this issue as \u201cwe want to take the bull by the horns\u201d.\n\nNajib\u2019s lead counsel, Muhammad Shafee Abdullah, had said last week the prosecution\u2019s case would have collapsed if the evidence of one of the signatories and then SRC directors, Suboh Md Yassin, was rejected by the High Court as he had made contradictory statements.\n\nSuboh had said he had at first told Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) investigators who met him in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates on Nov 17, 2015, that the 13 signatures in the electronic fund transfer instructions to the bank were genuine.\n\nHowever, he said while being cross-examined by Shafee, he told MACC officers in Putrajaya on May 28 and 30, 2018 that his signatures could have been forged.\n\nSuboh also said he once again told MACC officers on Aug 13 and 15, 2018 that the signatures were genuine.\n\nThe defence had suggested that former SRC chief executive officer Nik Faisal Ariff Kamil could have \u201cphotoshopped\u201d (digitally manipulated) Suboh\u2019s signature in the scanned copies before sending them to the bank to carry out the instructions to transfer funds.\n\nShafee had also suggested that Nik Faisal, who has gone missing, had forged and misused Suboh\u2019s signature and put it in the hard copies.\n\nNik Faisal and Suboh were the signatories of the SRC account from which money was transferred to Gandingan Mentari, a subsidiary of SRC.\n\nThey were also signatories of the Gandingan Mentari account, where money was transferred to Ihsan Perdana, a company selected to carry out corporate social responsibility programmes for SRC.\n\nThe prosecution contends that RM42 million from Ihsan Perdana was transferred to Najib\u2019s three Ambank accounts at the Jalan Raja Chulan branch through a \u201clayering process\u201d to conceal its origin.\n\nTrial judge Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali sentenced Najib in July last year to 12 years\u2019 jail and ordered him to pay a RM210 million fine after finding him guilty on the seven counts of abuse of power, criminal breach of trust and money laundering in relation to the RM42 million belonging to SRC.\n\nHe is appealing against his conviction and

optimisation, among others\n\nBy NUR HANANI AZMAN\n\nTHE possible merger between Celcom Axiata Bhd and DiGi.com Bhd would allow the combined entity to better compete in the 5G environment via scale, improved balance sheet and operational execution.\n\nWith 5G services offered via a wholesale arrangement (5G special purpose vehicle), mobile operators no longer need to spend heavily on capital expenditure (capex) but instead focus on price and branding, said RHB Investment Bank Bhd analyst Jeffrey Tan.\n\n\u201cConsolidation would, however, see the number of operators reduced and by extension, result in lesser competition,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve.\n\nOn April 8, Axiata Group Bhd and Telenor Asia Pte Ltd announced that they are in advanced discussions on the potential merger of Celcom and Digi, with the joint entity to be known as Celcom Digi Bhd or MergeCo.\n\nAxiata and Digi will have an equal stake of about 33.1% each in MergeCo, while Axiata together with local institutional funds will own over 51% of MergeCo.\n\nThe merged entity would have a combined 19.1 million customers and total revenue of RM12.4 billion.\n\nWhether this merger fails or succeeds, Jeffrey said it is imperative for mobile operators to consider the longer-term sustainability of the industry and to collaborate in ways to ensure their continued existence in the face of digitalisation.\n\n\u201cThere are lower execution risks with this proposal in that the scope of the merger is significantly smaller and national interests are taken into consideration,\u201d he

to spend RM1.8b in subsidy\n\nby SHAHEERA AZNAM SHAH / pic by RAZAK GHAZALI\n\nTHE Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) is maintaining the monthly quota for subsidised cooking oil through the Cooking Oil Stabilisation Scheme (COSS) at 60,000 tonnes amid the spike in the refined bleached and deodorised (RBD) palm olein price this year.\n\nThe price of vegetable cooking oil has surged 83% to RM4,122 per tonne in 2021 against RM2,255 per tonne recorded last year, said Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi (picture).\n\n\u201cKPDNHEP would like to clarify that the government still maintains the quota for subsidised cooking oil at 60,000 tonnes per month for 2020 and 2021 although the price of RBD palm olein has increased by 83% to RM4,122 per tonne in 2021 compared to RM2,255 per tonne in 2020.\n\n\u201cThis is equivalent to 60 million of 1kg polybag packets, allocated for each Malaysians, including in Sarawak and Sabah, and the government is committed to maintaining the allocation,\u201d he said in a statement yesterday.\n\nNanta Linggi added that should the price of vegetable cooking oil continue to increase, the government is expected to spend RM1.8 billion in subsidy, a hefty increase from RM400 million currently.\n\n\u201cIf the RBD palm olein price continues to show an upward trend, the subsidy cost for the scheme is expected to increase from RM400 million to RM1.8 billion.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the government\u2019s decision to maintain the quotas of the COSS programme indicates the level of commitment in reducing the cost of living and safeguarding the wellbeing of the people.\n\n\u201cThe KPDNHEP Enforcement Division has been conducting comprehensive audits regularly,\u201d he said.\n\nNanta Linggi was responding to a report by the local news portal, Borneo Post Online, claiming that there is a shortage of supply of subsidised cooking oil in the market.\n\nIn addressing the illegality of the distribution of subsidised

Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) has issued 84 notices against food and beverage premises operators nationwide for charging more than RM1 for a glass of plain water.\n\nIts Deputy Minister Datuk Rosol Wahid said all the notices were issued through Ops Catut 8.0 carried out since Wednesday (April 7) following complaints from the public.\n\n\u201cThe operation will be carried out until April 15 by enforcement teams nationwide. Based on the number of notices issued, we find that this is quite a common occurrence.\n\n\u201cThis should not happen... maybe a more appropriate price would be between RM0.20 or RM0.30,\u201c he told reporters after officiating the Terengganu state-level Franchise Bay Tour Programme here today.\n\nOf the 84 notices, Kelantan recorded the highest number with 14, followed by Selangor (12), Sabah (eight), Sarawak (eight), Johor (eight), Pahang (seven), Terengganu (six), Kuala Lumpur (five), Melaka (four), Federal Territory of Labuan (three), Penang (three), Perlis (two), Perak (two) and Negeri Sembilan (two).\n\nTraders who are issued with the notice will be given two to five working days to provide the information required by KPDNHEP before further action is taken in accordance with the Price Control and Anti -Profiteering Act 2011.\n\nMeanwhile, Rosol called on more franchisors to take advantage of the Micro and Affordable Franchise Development Programme to help create better opportunities for entrepreneurs, especially those in the B40 and M40 target groups.\n\nHe said there were currently 1,091 franchise brands registered in Malaysia, of which 694 were local franchise brands.\n\n\u201cHowever, so far only 12 franchise brands have offered micro franchises and affordable franchises. The number is still too small compared to the 1,091 registered franchise brands,\u201d he said.\n\nAffordable franchises are business packages worth RM100 thousand and below, while micro franchises are worth RM50 thousand and below.\n\nRosol said KPDNHEP had allocated a total of RM5 million for the Affordable and Micro Franchise Development Programme, comprising full grants worth RM2 million offered to franchisors, and matching grants totalling RM2.5 million for those from the B40 and M40 groups looking to open a franchise.\n\nOn an unrelated matter, Rosol, who is also Hulu Terengganu MP, said KPDNHEP was monitoring motorcycle sales activities around the Klang Valley, where customers were apparently finding it difficult to purchase new two-wheelers in cash.\n\n\u201cRecently I have received complaints from customers who say they find it difficult to buy motorcycles in cash, because sellers prefer customers to purchase them in installments.\n\n\u201cIf there are reports that traders are pressuring customers, KPDNHEP can investigate. There may be offences (committed) that we can take action against, especially if traders set different prices for the purchase of motorcycles in cash or monthly installments,\u201c he said.\n\nHe added that apart from keeping the people away from the burden of debt, he also did not want them to be saddled with interest payments.\n\n\u201cI think there may be an alliance between the motor companies and finance institutions... imagine if there is a charge of 5% or 8% in interest over five years, how much will they earn (compared to the cash deal) ... if there are two different prices according to the method of purchase, this is wrong,\u201c he said. \u2014 Bernama", "keyword": ["water", "issued", "priced", "84", "franchise", "terengganu", "micro", "nationwide", "glass", "plain", "notices", "kpdnhep", "franchises", "purchase", "issues", "customers", "rm1", "worth"], "summary": "KUALA TERENGGANU: The Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) has issued 84 notices against food and beverage premises operators nationwide for charging more than RM1 for a glass of plain water.\nBased on the number of notices issued, we find that this is quite a common occurrence.\n\u201cHowever, so far only 12 franchise brands have offered micro franchises and affordable franchises.\nAffordable franchises are business packages worth RM100 thousand and below, while micro franchises are worth RM50 thousand and below.\n\u201cIf there are reports that traders are pressuring customers, KPDNHEP can investigate.", "news": "The Sun Daily", "date": "2021-04-10 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Kelantan KPDNHEP seizes 800kg of flour sold without licence", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEPdxU7tI-7bms0z3UhdRH6kqGQgEKhAIACoHCAow9sveCjC0m9YBMPDtoQM?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/kpdnKel925_NSTfield_image_socialmedia.var_1618148048.jpg", "text": "", "keyword": ["flour", "licence", "seizes", "kpdnhep", "kelantan", "800kg", "sold"], "summary": "", "news": "New Straits Times", "date": "2021-04-11 00:00:00", "language": "INDONESIA"}, {"title": "Need Refund From Online Sellers Or Chicken Prices Too High?

the state to monitor and inspect various locations such as public markets, farmers\u2019 markets and supermarkets to ensure the supply and prices of essential goods, including chickens, are stable and adequate for the Ramadan month and Hari Raya Aidilfitri.\n\nIt further said according to the National Price Council Division (BHBN)of KPDNHEP Sarawak, the selling price of standard clean chicken from January to this month is between RM7.90 and RM8.80 per kg.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the price is at normal levels and does not show any unusual increase,\u201d it pointed out in a statement

maintaining a subsidised cooking oil quota of 60,000 tonnes per month despite the increase in the price of refined, bleached and deodorised (RBD) palm oil, says Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi (picture).\n\nThis is equivalent to 60 million one-kilogramme (kg) polybag packets, with 1.5 kg allocated for every Malaysian, including in Sabah and Sarawak.\n\nNanta said RBD palm oil increased by about 83 per cent to RM4,122 per tonne this year compared to RM2,255 per tonne in 2020.\n\n\u201cThe government has also increased the allocation based on a commitment to supply 60,000 tonnes although the price of RBD palm olein has gone up,\u201d he said, adding that the government expected the cost of the subsidy scheme to increase from RM400 million to RM1.8 billion if the price of RBD palm olein continued to rise.\n\n\u201cAs such, the government\u2019s decision to maintain the quota in the Cooking Oil Stabilisation Scheme (COSS) shows the government\u2019s high commitment to reduce the cost of living and ensure the well-being of the people,\u201d he said in a statement today.\n\nThe statement was issued following news reports on alleged shortage of subsidised cooking oil in Sarawak which stemmed from the dishonest action of cooking oil packaging companies of not supplying subsidised cooking oil in prescribed quantities for distribution to supermarkets and grocery stores.\n\nThe report also suggested that KPDNHEP step up monitoring and enforcement on subsidised cooking oil packaging activities and ensure that the RM400 million cooking oil subsidy allocation this year is spent prudently.\n\nNanta said KPDNHEP\u2019s enforcement division always conducted comprehensive audits to ensure that every subsidised cooking oil production was acceptable in each of its distribution chains.\n\nFollowing the audit and stern action in tackling the leakage of subsidised cooking oil distribution, Nanta said a total of 318 cases had been recorded nationwide from 2016 to March 2021.\n\nDuring the same period, four cooking oil packaging companies were taken to task by cancelling the quotas given to them earlier, he said.\n\nOn complaints related to cooking oil in Sarawak, Nanta said a review of records found that there had been 25 complaints since 2020 until March 31 (2021) and 4,221 inspections conducted on premises selling cooking oil until yesterday (April 12).\n\nOn the sugar issue which was also touched on in the news report, Nanta said in principle, the selling price of domestic sugar was controlled at a maximum price of RM2.85 per kg for coarse refined white sugar and RM2.95 per kg for refined white sugar for retail sale.\n\nThe wholesale selling price of sugar for use in the food and beverage (F&B) industry is set at RM2.77 per kg for coarse refined white sugar and RM2.85 per kg for refined white sugar.\n\n\u201cThe difference in lower sugar prices can be enjoyed by F&B companies based on the quantity and method of purchase agreed upon with the supplier, and also depending on the price of raw sugar in the world market without government intervention,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the news report, the F&B industry now has to spend more to get refined sugar at RM2.75 per kg.\n\nNanta said local F&B companies and wholesalers could apply for permits to import refined sugar at any time of the year.\n\n\u201cEligible applications will be carefully considered by an evaluation committee represented by several relevant government agencies including the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, the Malaysian Investment Development Authority and the Royal Malaysian Customs Department, he said.\n\n\u201cThe priority of issuing import permits is to any F&B manufacturing company and wholesaler that meets the evaluation criteria set,\u201d he added.\n\nNanta said continuous monitoring would be carried out on the recipients of permits to import refined sugar to prevent misuse and misappropriation, and enforcement action would be taken against those who misused the permits to import refined sugar.", "keyword": ["sugar", "oil", "month", "fb", "white", "subsidised", "remains",

yesterday claimed that there is a shortage of subsidised 1kg pack of cooking oil due to under-production by some repackers who have been receiving government subsidies.\n\nThe former deputy minister of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) said the government had allocated RM400 million for the cooking oil price stabilisation scheme this year alone to enable the needy across Malaysia to buy the subsidised cooking oil at RM2.50.\n\n\u201cEvery year, there is government allocation to maintain the price of the 1kg subsidised cooking oil at RM2.50. The allocation for this year is RM400 million and it was also RM400 million last year.\n\n\u201cWhen PH (Pakatan Harapan) was the government, the allocation was RM720 million in 2018 and RM600 million in 2019. During our time, we made sure all this amount go to packing the subsidised cooking oil. But lately I noticed that there is a huge shortage of this 1kg cooking oil,\u201d he said during his Facebook live in e-Mart Batu Kawa here.\n\nChong, who is Stampin MP and Kota Sentosa assemblyman, claimed that some repackers had resorted to over-claiming of subsidies or under-production of subsidised cooking oil.\n\nFor instance, he said a repacker who was supposed to pack 1,500kg of cooking oil only packed 1,000kg but still claimed the subsidy amount for 1,500kg.\n\n\u201cDuring PH\u2019s time, it\u2019s very seldom that you didn\u2019t get the 1kg cooking oil in the market. But after PH is no longer the government, most of the time you can\u2019t get this 1kg cooking oil.\n\n\u201cWhy? I believe the hanky panky thing has found its way back to the system. That\u2019s why we are having this Facebook live to forewarn the government,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also called upon his former colleagues at KPDNHEP to carry out strict enforcement to ensure a stable supply of the subsidised cooking oil.\n\nWhen he was the deputy KPDNHEP minister, Chong said they kept a record of the volume repackers delivered to the retailers, who must then have a record for the ministry to cross check.\n\nWith such strict enforcement, he said the government would be able to make sure that the allocation could benefit the target groups.\n\n\u201cI think the situation is quite bad now, a lot of time you can\u2019t find the 1kg cooking oil. After all, it\u2019s RM400 million of government allocation we are talking about.\u201d\n\nChong said the previous PH government managed to bring down the price of sugar to RM1.70 or RM1.80 per kg for food and beverages (F&B) manufacturers but today, they had to fork out RM2.75 per kg.\n\nHe added that the former federal government opened up sugar import for F&B manufacturers in Sarawak.\n\nHe was glad that the current federal government had carried on the policy but some F&B manufacturers in the state had complained that their applications for sugar import had been rejected by Putrajaya.\n\n\u201c(KPDNHEP Minister Datuk) Alexandar Nanta Linggi is a Sarawakian. He can do much better than what I did as a deputy minister since he is a full minister.\n\n\u201cI will talk to Alexandar Nanta and ask him to make it easier for F&B manufacturers in Sarawak to apply for the sugar import permit,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier, Chong handed out shopping vouchers worth RM100 to about 40 needy individuals under a social programme in collaboration with e-Mart Batu Kawa to

introduced 20 initiatives since 2020 to help companies and entrepreneurs reduce the impact of Covid-19 in their businesses.\n\nOf these initiatives, three of them were also announced in the Pemerkasa agenda.\n\nSSM\u2019s first initiative in Pemerkasa was to increase the current threshold value of indebtedness under Section 466 of the Companies Act 2016 from RM10,000 to RM50,000 until Dec 31, 2020, along with the period to respond to a notice of claim by a company was also extended to six months.\n\n\u201cTaking into account the uncertainties in the global and domestic economic conditions following the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, SSM has also announced that the company\u2019s indebtedness threshold was raised to RM50,000 effective April 1, 2021, as a new permanent threshold value,\u201d said Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi in his speech during SSM\u2019s 19th Anniversary Ceremony in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.\n\nThe second initiative offers free business registration facilities to B40 group entrepreneurs and full -time IPT students who wish to venture into entrepreneurship while the third initiative was offering assistance to the disabled to register and renew their business with SSM for free.\n\nHe added SSM remains committed to helping ease the burden of the business community by implementing initiatives to extend the compound exemption for delays in renewing business registrations and delays in registering new businesses under the Business Registration Act 1956 until Dec 31 this year which will benefit over 330,000 business communities.\n\nThe minister announced this initiative on March 30, as an extension of the implementation of the compound exemption for delays in renewing business registration certificates implemented from March 17 \u2013 Dec 31, 2020, before being extended until June 30 this year.\n\nIn the same event he said SSM has spent a total of RM3.6 million in corporate zakat allocation and RM242,500 in corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives in 2020.\n\n\u201cI hope that SSM will be more successful in the future and be able to continue this noble endeavour,\u201d he added.\n\nSSM also launched the \u2018Usahawan Bijak, Usahawan Berdaftar\u2019 campaign that aims to produce ethical and trusted entrepreneurs and will be implemented throughout 2021.\n\nThe campaign is one of the methods to encourage the public, especially traders to register businesses.\n\nAll businesses need to register with SSM either under the Business Registration Act 1956 which applies in Peninsular Malaysia and the Federal Territory of Labuan or under the Companies Act 2016 and the Limited Liability Partnership Act 2012.\n\nThrough this campaign, SSM calls on all

I have very little information on her and her family as my mother would not want to share much on her sister who was \u2018given away\u2019 or maybe she really didn\u2019t know much about them as she was from another mother,\u201d Sim explained.\n\n\u201cThen 21 years ago we managed to meet up for the first time. Then Toh Puan Sri had just married Tun Pehin Sri Salahuddin. Suddenly our family size grew following the meeting for the first time between Toh Puan Sri and my mum, since their birth.\u201d\n\nAlthough Norkiah was given up for adoption to a Malay family back in the early 50s, when the situations in those days were tough with some households having more than 10 children, it was not unusual for families to give away their children (particularly girls) to young couples who were not able to conceive their own, he said.\n\n\u201cA few months after the family meeting, Tun Pehin Sri Salahuddin was appointed as the Governor of Sarawak again (for the second time) and my late auntie\u2019s life took a huge change. Her role changed drastically from a loving wife to Tun, but was elevated to First Lady of Sarawak.\n\n\u201cThe late Toh Puan Sri was fortunate because her life story would become one that is reminiscent of the Cinderella story when she met, fell in love and married Tun Pehin Sri. She was Tun Pehin Sri\u2019s second wife after his first wife had passed away,\u201d Sim added.\n\n\u201cShe was born into a poor Chinese family and given away to an equally poor Malay family and like Cinderella she ended up happy ever after in the Astana of Sarawak as the First Lady of Sarawak.\n\n\u201cShe made sure that her years as First Lady were not wasted. She started her charity works, helped and touched so many lives like the orphans, elderly and the poor. She was generous, approachable, down to earth and putting others first.\u201d\n\nSince then, she had dedicated her life to the wellbeing of others, playing her role as the mother to all Sarawakians regardless of race or creed, Sim added.\n\n(For the freshest news, join our Telegram channel)\n\n\u201cIndeed Toh Puan\u2019s life is part and parcel of Sarawak\u2019s story. Hers is similar to that of Datin Amar Dato Hajjah Juma\u2019ani Tuanku Haji Bujang, wife of the Chief Minister (Datuk Patinggi Abang Johari Tun Openg), who was also adopted by a Muslim family from a Chinese family.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy aunty and Tun Pehin Sri had brought much peace, harmony and unity of all Sarawakians. They would be joining my activities by lending their support especially during Inter-cultural Mooncake festival. They would not miss any of the annual celebrations held at Carpenter Street. They would grace dinner functions hosted by many associations that me and my late father Datuk Sim Swee Yong were involved in. Their show of love for all Sarawakians irrespective of race and religion is what makes us and Sarawakians unique and special,\u201d added Sim.\n\n\u201cShe was a shining example of our unity in diversity. Her upbringing in a Muslim and Malay family is very typical of our Sarawakian lifestyle in the early 50s and 60s when children were given for adoption due to poverty. This priceless practice is the saving grace of our bond and unity of all races in Sarawak.

Instead, let the interministerial discussion happen, then formulate a pricing index and monitor it.\n\n\u201cMake a one-year action plan, not only for festive season. Run it for a year, check every month (whether it is) working or not. If something is wrong, solve it,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve (TMR).\n\nGeorge, with 45 years of experience addressing public interest issues, said the government is not engaging consumer groups to handle the problem.\n\nHe said price hike will change consumers\u2019 purchasing patterns which activate the panic buying mode where people buy more and impact the distribution chain.\n\n\u201cThe government needs to set a competent task force with intelligent members to sit with policymakers, so they can advise the ministers after being on the ground on a plan of action that can be rolled out to address the issue.\n\n\u201cTo come out with realistic costs, we have to make sure people on the ground or people in the marketplace are not profiteering,\u201d he added.\n\nGeorge said he was part of a task force which was set up before the last election, but the committee didn\u2019t get off the ground with the change in government.\n\nMeanwhile, Federation of Malaysian Consumers Associations (Fomca) CEO Datuk Dr Paul Selvaraj said increases in prices are not just an immediate problem, but caused by investment in agriculture and supply chain competitiveness.\n\nHe said a lot of production is still dependent on imports and when the prices go up in the international market, the country gets affected.\n\n\u201cFomca always advocates moving forward self-sufficiency so that we are not impacted by world trade or problems from other markets.\n\n\u201cWe neglect the agriculture sector and do not beat up the demand of our modern economy. We still import beef, fish and vegetables,\u201d he told TMR.\n\nHe said Malaysia needs to shift focus to agriculture production by maintaining a vibrant industry, not only for production purposes, but also to attract new generations.\n\n\u201cTo make it attractive, it must be viable and (can) provide a good income. In other countries, developing sustainable agriculture is a major stake. Why can\u2019t we do that?\u201d he added.\n\nHe also said the Malaysia Competition Commission did a market surveillance on food and they found that along the supply chain, there is a lot of market manipulation that gets people together and manipulates prices.\n\nWhile conducting the survey, \u201cthey also identified a long supply chain where the market manipulation is going on. Monopolistic behaviour makes consumers suffer\u201d.\n\n\u201cSince the information is there and a survey has been done, the government should take action towards these people who take advantage of profit gearing. It should be a continuing enforcement,\u201d he said.\n\nMalaysian Muslim Consumers Association lead activist Datuk Nadzim Johan said the government does not really play their role to address the increasing prices of essential items.\n\n\u201cIt is a big challenge, but we have an option actually. But we chose the wrong way. Why do we have to buy chillies from Thailand at RM26 per kg?\n\n\u201cOur agriculture is still lagging. Why don\u2019t we plant those vegetables ourselves?\u201d he told TMR.\n\nNadzim said the current state of Emergency needs to end immediately to tackle this issue which can lead to serious problems, such as unemployment, suicide and high debt.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the Emergency is necessary in the first place.

Najib has no privity of contract with the bank,\u201d he said.\n\nSithambaram, who was given a special licence by the attorney-general to prosecute Najib\u2019s SRC International corruption case, said \u201cthe defence has to respond to the prosecution\u2019s case on the seven charges\u201d faced by the former prime minister.\n\n\u201cThe issue of forged or unauthorised scan (of signatures) and electronic transfer is a non-starter, especially for the criminal breach of trust charges.\n\n\u201cThe issue raised is a red herring by the defence, and who would have the audacity to fix a then sitting prime minister?\u201d he asked.\n\nHe said SRC did not sue the bank for negligence or asked the financial institution to pay back the money.\n\n\u201cNo company will keep quiet if there is no proper authorisation and withdrawal of money.\u201d\n\nSithambaram said there was evidence that the SRC directors had authorised the bank to conduct electronic transfers and the bank said it had also acted based on the mandate of SRC signatories.\n\nIn fact, he said, Najib had not returned the RM42 million although he had admitted receiving the money that belonged to SRC.\n\n\u201cHe only said (he did not have) knowledge of how the money came in but we have proven the RM42 million went into his accounts,\u201d he said, adding that the prosecution was raising this issue as \u201cwe want to take the bull by the horns\u201d.\n\nNajib\u2019s lead counsel, Muhammad Shafee Abdullah, had said last week the prosecution\u2019s case would have collapsed if the evidence of one of the signatories and then SRC directors, Suboh Md Yassin, was rejected by the High Court as he had made contradictory statements.\n\nSuboh had said he had at first told Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) investigators who met him in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates on Nov 17, 2015, that the 13 signatures in the electronic fund transfer instructions to the bank were genuine.\n\nHowever, he said while being cross-examined by Shafee, he told MACC officers in Putrajaya on May 28 and 30, 2018 that his signatures could have been forged.\n\nSuboh also said he once again told MACC officers on Aug 13 and 15, 2018 that the signatures were genuine.\n\nThe defence had suggested that former SRC chief executive officer Nik Faisal Ariff Kamil could have \u201cphotoshopped\u201d (digitally manipulated) Suboh\u2019s signature in the scanned copies before sending them to the bank to carry out the instructions to transfer funds.\n\nShafee had also suggested that Nik Faisal, who has gone missing, had forged and misused Suboh\u2019s signature and put it in the hard copies.\n\nNik Faisal and Suboh were the signatories of the SRC account from which money was transferred to Gandingan Mentari, a subsidiary of SRC.\n\nThey were also signatories of the Gandingan Mentari account, where money was transferred to Ihsan Perdana, a company selected to carry out corporate social responsibility programmes for SRC.\n\nThe prosecution contends that RM42 million from Ihsan Perdana was transferred to Najib\u2019s three Ambank accounts at the Jalan Raja Chulan branch through a \u201clayering process\u201d to conceal its origin.\n\nTrial judge Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali sentenced Najib in July last year to 12 years\u2019 jail and ordered him to pay a RM210 million fine after finding him guilty on the seven counts of abuse of power, criminal breach of trust and money laundering in relation to the RM42 million belonging to SRC.\n\nHe is appealing against his conviction and

optimisation, among others\n\nBy NUR HANANI AZMAN\n\nTHE possible merger between Celcom Axiata Bhd and DiGi.com Bhd would allow the combined entity to better compete in the 5G environment via scale, improved balance sheet and operational execution.\n\nWith 5G services offered via a wholesale arrangement (5G special purpose vehicle), mobile operators no longer need to spend heavily on capital expenditure (capex) but instead focus on price and branding, said RHB Investment Bank Bhd analyst Jeffrey Tan.\n\n\u201cConsolidation would, however, see the number of operators reduced and by extension, result in lesser competition,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve.\n\nOn April 8, Axiata Group Bhd and Telenor Asia Pte Ltd announced that they are in advanced discussions on the potential merger of Celcom and Digi, with the joint entity to be known as Celcom Digi Bhd or MergeCo.\n\nAxiata and Digi will have an equal stake of about 33.1% each in MergeCo, while Axiata together with local institutional funds will own over 51% of MergeCo.\n\nThe merged entity would have a combined 19.1 million customers and total revenue of RM12.4 billion.\n\nWhether this merger fails or succeeds, Jeffrey said it is imperative for mobile operators to consider the longer-term sustainability of the industry and to collaborate in ways to ensure their continued existence in the face of digitalisation.\n\n\u201cThere are lower execution risks with this proposal in that the scope of the merger is significantly smaller and national interests are taken into consideration,\u201d he

to spend RM1.8b in subsidy\n\nby SHAHEERA AZNAM SHAH / pic by RAZAK GHAZALI\n\nTHE Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) is maintaining the monthly quota for subsidised cooking oil through the Cooking Oil Stabilisation Scheme (COSS) at 60,000 tonnes amid the spike in the refined bleached and deodorised (RBD) palm olein price this year.\n\nThe price of vegetable cooking oil has surged 83% to RM4,122 per tonne in 2021 against RM2,255 per tonne recorded last year, said Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi (picture).\n\n\u201cKPDNHEP would like to clarify that the government still maintains the quota for subsidised cooking oil at 60,000 tonnes per month for 2020 and 2021 although the price of RBD palm olein has increased by 83% to RM4,122 per tonne in 2021 compared to RM2,255 per tonne in 2020.\n\n\u201cThis is equivalent to 60 million of 1kg polybag packets, allocated for each Malaysians, including in Sarawak and Sabah, and the government is committed to maintaining the allocation,\u201d he said in a statement yesterday.\n\nNanta Linggi added that should the price of vegetable cooking oil continue to increase, the government is expected to spend RM1.8 billion in subsidy, a hefty increase from RM400 million currently.\n\n\u201cIf the RBD palm olein price continues to show an upward trend, the subsidy cost for the scheme is expected to increase from RM400 million to RM1.8 billion.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the government\u2019s decision to maintain the quotas of the COSS programme indicates the level of commitment in reducing the cost of living and safeguarding the wellbeing of the people.\n\n\u201cThe KPDNHEP Enforcement Division has been conducting comprehensive audits regularly,\u201d he said.\n\nNanta Linggi was responding to a report by the local news portal, Borneo Post Online, claiming that there is a shortage of supply of subsidised cooking oil in the market.\n\nIn addressing the illegality of the distribution of subsidised

Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) has issued 84 notices against food and beverage premises operators nationwide for charging more than RM1 for a glass of plain water.\n\nIts Deputy Minister Datuk Rosol Wahid said all the notices were issued through Ops Catut 8.0 carried out since Wednesday (April 7) following complaints from the public.\n\n\u201cThe operation will be carried out until April 15 by enforcement teams nationwide. Based on the number of notices issued, we find that this is quite a common occurrence.\n\n\u201cThis should not happen... maybe a more appropriate price would be between RM0.20 or RM0.30,\u201c he told reporters after officiating the Terengganu state-level Franchise Bay Tour Programme here today.\n\nOf the 84 notices, Kelantan recorded the highest number with 14, followed by Selangor (12), Sabah (eight), Sarawak (eight), Johor (eight), Pahang (seven), Terengganu (six), Kuala Lumpur (five), Melaka (four), Federal Territory of Labuan (three), Penang (three), Perlis (two), Perak (two) and Negeri Sembilan (two).\n\nTraders who are issued with the notice will be given two to five working days to provide the information required by KPDNHEP before further action is taken in accordance with the Price Control and Anti -Profiteering Act 2011.\n\nMeanwhile, Rosol called on more franchisors to take advantage of the Micro and Affordable Franchise Development Programme to help create better opportunities for entrepreneurs, especially those in the B40 and M40 target groups.\n\nHe said there were currently 1,091 franchise brands registered in Malaysia, of which 694 were local franchise brands.\n\n\u201cHowever, so far only 12 franchise brands have offered micro franchises and affordable franchises. The number is still too small compared to the 1,091 registered franchise brands,\u201d he said.\n\nAffordable franchises are business packages worth RM100 thousand and below, while micro franchises are worth RM50 thousand and below.\n\nRosol said KPDNHEP had allocated a total of RM5 million for the Affordable and Micro Franchise Development Programme, comprising full grants worth RM2 million offered to franchisors, and matching grants totalling RM2.5 million for those from the B40 and M40 groups looking to open a franchise.\n\nOn an unrelated matter, Rosol, who is also Hulu Terengganu MP, said KPDNHEP was monitoring motorcycle sales activities around the Klang Valley, where customers were apparently finding it difficult to purchase new two-wheelers in cash.\n\n\u201cRecently I have received complaints from customers who say they find it difficult to buy motorcycles in cash, because sellers prefer customers to purchase them in installments.\n\n\u201cIf there are reports that traders are pressuring customers, KPDNHEP can investigate. There may be offences (committed) that we can take action against, especially if traders set different prices for the purchase of motorcycles in cash or monthly installments,\u201c he said.\n\nHe added that apart from keeping the people away from the burden of debt, he also did not want them to be saddled with interest payments.\n\n\u201cI think there may be an alliance between the motor companies and finance institutions... imagine if there is a charge of 5% or 8% in interest over five years, how much will they earn (compared to the cash deal) ... if there are two different prices according to the method of purchase, this is wrong,\u201c he said. \u2014 Bernama", "keyword": ["water", "issued", "priced", "84", "franchise", "terengganu", "micro", "nationwide", "glass", "plain", "notices", "kpdnhep", "franchises", "purchase", "issues", "customers", "rm1", "worth"], "summary": "KUALA TERENGGANU: The Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) has issued 84 notices against food and beverage premises operators nationwide for charging more than RM1 for a glass of plain water.\nBased on the number of notices issued, we find that this is quite a common occurrence.\n\u201cHowever, so far only 12 franchise brands have offered micro franchises and affordable franchises.\nAffordable franchises are business packages worth RM100 thousand and below, while micro franchises are worth RM50 thousand and below.\n\u201cIf there are reports that traders are pressuring customers, KPDNHEP can investigate.", "news": "The Sun Daily", "date": "2021-04-10 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Kelantan KPDNHEP seizes 800kg of flour sold without licence", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEPdxU7tI-7bms0z3UhdRH6kqGQgEKhAIACoHCAow9sveCjC0m9YBMPDtoQM?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/kpdnKel925_NSTfield_image_socialmedia.var_1618148048.jpg", "text": "", "keyword": ["flour", "licence", "seizes", "kpdnhep", "kelantan", "800kg", "sold"], "summary": "", "news": "New Straits Times", "date": "2021-04-11 00:00:00", "language": "INDONESIA"}, {"title": "Need Refund From Online Sellers Or Chicken Prices Too High?

the state to monitor and inspect various locations such as public markets, farmers\u2019 markets and supermarkets to ensure the supply and prices of essential goods, including chickens, are stable and adequate for the Ramadan month and Hari Raya Aidilfitri.\n\nIt further said according to the National Price Council Division (BHBN)of KPDNHEP Sarawak, the selling price of standard clean chicken from January to this month is between RM7.90 and RM8.80 per kg.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the price is at normal levels and does not show any unusual increase,\u201d it pointed out in a statement

maintaining a subsidised cooking oil quota of 60,000 tonnes per month despite the increase in the price of refined, bleached and deodorised (RBD) palm oil, says Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi (picture).\n\nThis is equivalent to 60 million one-kilogramme (kg) polybag packets, with 1.5 kg allocated for every Malaysian, including in Sabah and Sarawak.\n\nNanta said RBD palm oil increased by about 83 per cent to RM4,122 per tonne this year compared to RM2,255 per tonne in 2020.\n\n\u201cThe government has also increased the allocation based on a commitment to supply 60,000 tonnes although the price of RBD palm olein has gone up,\u201d he said, adding that the government expected the cost of the subsidy scheme to increase from RM400 million to RM1.8 billion if the price of RBD palm olein continued to rise.\n\n\u201cAs such, the government\u2019s decision to maintain the quota in the Cooking Oil Stabilisation Scheme (COSS) shows the government\u2019s high commitment to reduce the cost of living and ensure the well-being of the people,\u201d he said in a statement today.\n\nThe statement was issued following news reports on alleged shortage of subsidised cooking oil in Sarawak which stemmed from the dishonest action of cooking oil packaging companies of not supplying subsidised cooking oil in prescribed quantities for distribution to supermarkets and grocery stores.\n\nThe report also suggested that KPDNHEP step up monitoring and enforcement on subsidised cooking oil packaging activities and ensure that the RM400 million cooking oil subsidy allocation this year is spent prudently.\n\nNanta said KPDNHEP\u2019s enforcement division always conducted comprehensive audits to ensure that every subsidised cooking oil production was acceptable in each of its distribution chains.\n\nFollowing the audit and stern action in tackling the leakage of subsidised cooking oil distribution, Nanta said a total of 318 cases had been recorded nationwide from 2016 to March 2021.\n\nDuring the same period, four cooking oil packaging companies were taken to task by cancelling the quotas given to them earlier, he said.\n\nOn complaints related to cooking oil in Sarawak, Nanta said a review of records found that there had been 25 complaints since 2020 until March 31 (2021) and 4,221 inspections conducted on premises selling cooking oil until yesterday (April 12).\n\nOn the sugar issue which was also touched on in the news report, Nanta said in principle, the selling price of domestic sugar was controlled at a maximum price of RM2.85 per kg for coarse refined white sugar and RM2.95 per kg for refined white sugar for retail sale.\n\nThe wholesale selling price of sugar for use in the food and beverage (F&B) industry is set at RM2.77 per kg for coarse refined white sugar and RM2.85 per kg for refined white sugar.\n\n\u201cThe difference in lower sugar prices can be enjoyed by F&B companies based on the quantity and method of purchase agreed upon with the supplier, and also depending on the price of raw sugar in the world market without government intervention,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the news report, the F&B industry now has to spend more to get refined sugar at RM2.75 per kg.\n\nNanta said local F&B companies and wholesalers could apply for permits to import refined sugar at any time of the year.\n\n\u201cEligible applications will be carefully considered by an evaluation committee represented by several relevant government agencies including the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, the Malaysian Investment Development Authority and the Royal Malaysian Customs Department, he said.\n\n\u201cThe priority of issuing import permits is to any F&B manufacturing company and wholesaler that meets the evaluation criteria set,\u201d he added.\n\nNanta said continuous monitoring would be carried out on the recipients of permits to import refined sugar to prevent misuse and misappropriation, and enforcement action would be taken against those who misused the permits to import refined sugar.", "keyword": ["sugar", "oil", "month", "fb", "white", "subsidised", "remains",

yesterday claimed that there is a shortage of subsidised 1kg pack of cooking oil due to under-production by some repackers who have been receiving government subsidies.\n\nThe former deputy minister of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) said the government had allocated RM400 million for the cooking oil price stabilisation scheme this year alone to enable the needy across Malaysia to buy the subsidised cooking oil at RM2.50.\n\n\u201cEvery year, there is government allocation to maintain the price of the 1kg subsidised cooking oil at RM2.50. The allocation for this year is RM400 million and it was also RM400 million last year.\n\n\u201cWhen PH (Pakatan Harapan) was the government, the allocation was RM720 million in 2018 and RM600 million in 2019. During our time, we made sure all this amount go to packing the subsidised cooking oil. But lately I noticed that there is a huge shortage of this 1kg cooking oil,\u201d he said during his Facebook live in e-Mart Batu Kawa here.\n\nChong, who is Stampin MP and Kota Sentosa assemblyman, claimed that some repackers had resorted to over-claiming of subsidies or under-production of subsidised cooking oil.\n\nFor instance, he said a repacker who was supposed to pack 1,500kg of cooking oil only packed 1,000kg but still claimed the subsidy amount for 1,500kg.\n\n\u201cDuring PH\u2019s time, it\u2019s very seldom that you didn\u2019t get the 1kg cooking oil in the market. But after PH is no longer the government, most of the time you can\u2019t get this 1kg cooking oil.\n\n\u201cWhy? I believe the hanky panky thing has found its way back to the system. That\u2019s why we are having this Facebook live to forewarn the government,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also called upon his former colleagues at KPDNHEP to carry out strict enforcement to ensure a stable supply of the subsidised cooking oil.\n\nWhen he was the deputy KPDNHEP minister, Chong said they kept a record of the volume repackers delivered to the retailers, who must then have a record for the ministry to cross check.\n\nWith such strict enforcement, he said the government would be able to make sure that the allocation could benefit the target groups.\n\n\u201cI think the situation is quite bad now, a lot of time you can\u2019t find the 1kg cooking oil. After all, it\u2019s RM400 million of government allocation we are talking about.\u201d\n\nChong said the previous PH government managed to bring down the price of sugar to RM1.70 or RM1.80 per kg for food and beverages (F&B) manufacturers but today, they had to fork out RM2.75 per kg.\n\nHe added that the former federal government opened up sugar import for F&B manufacturers in Sarawak.\n\nHe was glad that the current federal government had carried on the policy but some F&B manufacturers in the state had complained that their applications for sugar import had been rejected by Putrajaya.\n\n\u201c(KPDNHEP Minister Datuk) Alexandar Nanta Linggi is a Sarawakian. He can do much better than what I did as a deputy minister since he is a full minister.\n\n\u201cI will talk to Alexandar Nanta and ask him to make it easier for F&B manufacturers in Sarawak to apply for the sugar import permit,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier, Chong handed out shopping vouchers worth RM100 to about 40 needy individuals under a social programme in collaboration with e-Mart Batu Kawa to

introduced 20 initiatives since 2020 to help companies and entrepreneurs reduce the impact of Covid-19 in their businesses.\n\nOf these initiatives, three of them were also announced in the Pemerkasa agenda.\n\nSSM\u2019s first initiative in Pemerkasa was to increase the current threshold value of indebtedness under Section 466 of the Companies Act 2016 from RM10,000 to RM50,000 until Dec 31, 2020, along with the period to respond to a notice of claim by a company was also extended to six months.\n\n\u201cTaking into account the uncertainties in the global and domestic economic conditions following the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, SSM has also announced that the company\u2019s indebtedness threshold was raised to RM50,000 effective April 1, 2021, as a new permanent threshold value,\u201d said Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi in his speech during SSM\u2019s 19th Anniversary Ceremony in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.\n\nThe second initiative offers free business registration facilities to B40 group entrepreneurs and full -time IPT students who wish to venture into entrepreneurship while the third initiative was offering assistance to the disabled to register and renew their business with SSM for free.\n\nHe added SSM remains committed to helping ease the burden of the business community by implementing initiatives to extend the compound exemption for delays in renewing business registrations and delays in registering new businesses under the Business Registration Act 1956 until Dec 31 this year which will benefit over 330,000 business communities.\n\nThe minister announced this initiative on March 30, as an extension of the implementation of the compound exemption for delays in renewing business registration certificates implemented from March 17 \u2013 Dec 31, 2020, before being extended until June 30 this year.\n\nIn the same event he said SSM has spent a total of RM3.6 million in corporate zakat allocation and RM242,500 in corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives in 2020.\n\n\u201cI hope that SSM will be more successful in the future and be able to continue this noble endeavour,\u201d he added.\n\nSSM also launched the \u2018Usahawan Bijak, Usahawan Berdaftar\u2019 campaign that aims to produce ethical and trusted entrepreneurs and will be implemented throughout 2021.\n\nThe campaign is one of the methods to encourage the public, especially traders to register businesses.\n\nAll businesses need to register with SSM either under the Business Registration Act 1956 which applies in Peninsular Malaysia and the Federal Territory of Labuan or under the Companies Act 2016 and the Limited Liability Partnership Act 2012.\n\nThrough this campaign, SSM calls on all

I have very little information on her and her family as my mother would not want to share much on her sister who was \u2018given away\u2019 or maybe she really didn\u2019t know much about them as she was from another mother,\u201d Sim explained.\n\n\u201cThen 21 years ago we managed to meet up for the first time. Then Toh Puan Sri had just married Tun Pehin Sri Salahuddin. Suddenly our family size grew following the meeting for the first time between Toh Puan Sri and my mum, since their birth.\u201d\n\nAlthough Norkiah was given up for adoption to a Malay family back in the early 50s, when the situations in those days were tough with some households having more than 10 children, it was not unusual for families to give away their children (particularly girls) to young couples who were not able to conceive their own, he said.\n\n\u201cA few months after the family meeting, Tun Pehin Sri Salahuddin was appointed as the Governor of Sarawak again (for the second time) and my late auntie\u2019s life took a huge change. Her role changed drastically from a loving wife to Tun, but was elevated to First Lady of Sarawak.\n\n\u201cThe late Toh Puan Sri was fortunate because her life story would become one that is reminiscent of the Cinderella story when she met, fell in love and married Tun Pehin Sri. She was Tun Pehin Sri\u2019s second wife after his first wife had passed away,\u201d Sim added.\n\n\u201cShe was born into a poor Chinese family and given away to an equally poor Malay family and like Cinderella she ended up happy ever after in the Astana of Sarawak as the First Lady of Sarawak.\n\n\u201cShe made sure that her years as First Lady were not wasted. She started her charity works, helped and touched so many lives like the orphans, elderly and the poor. She was generous, approachable, down to earth and putting others first.\u201d\n\nSince then, she had dedicated her life to the wellbeing of others, playing her role as the mother to all Sarawakians regardless of race or creed, Sim added.\n\n(For the freshest news, join our Telegram channel)\n\n\u201cIndeed Toh Puan\u2019s life is part and parcel of Sarawak\u2019s story. Hers is similar to that of Datin Amar Dato Hajjah Juma\u2019ani Tuanku Haji Bujang, wife of the Chief Minister (Datuk Patinggi Abang Johari Tun Openg), who was also adopted by a Muslim family from a Chinese family.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy aunty and Tun Pehin Sri had brought much peace, harmony and unity of all Sarawakians. They would be joining my activities by lending their support especially during Inter-cultural Mooncake festival. They would not miss any of the annual celebrations held at Carpenter Street. They would grace dinner functions hosted by many associations that me and my late father Datuk Sim Swee Yong were involved in. Their show of love for all Sarawakians irrespective of race and religion is what makes us and Sarawakians unique and special,\u201d added Sim.\n\n\u201cShe was a shining example of our unity in diversity. Her upbringing in a Muslim and Malay family is very typical of our Sarawakian lifestyle in the early 50s and 60s when children were given for adoption due to poverty. This priceless practice is the saving grace of our bond and unity of all races in Sarawak.

Instead, let the interministerial discussion happen, then formulate a pricing index and monitor it.\n\n\u201cMake a one-year action plan, not only for festive season. Run it for a year, check every month (whether it is) working or not. If something is wrong, solve it,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve (TMR).\n\nGeorge, with 45 years of experience addressing public interest issues, said the government is not engaging consumer groups to handle the problem.\n\nHe said price hike will change consumers\u2019 purchasing patterns which activate the panic buying mode where people buy more and impact the distribution chain.\n\n\u201cThe government needs to set a competent task force with intelligent members to sit with policymakers, so they can advise the ministers after being on the ground on a plan of action that can be rolled out to address the issue.\n\n\u201cTo come out with realistic costs, we have to make sure people on the ground or people in the marketplace are not profiteering,\u201d he added.\n\nGeorge said he was part of a task force which was set up before the last election, but the committee didn\u2019t get off the ground with the change in government.\n\nMeanwhile, Federation of Malaysian Consumers Associations (Fomca) CEO Datuk Dr Paul Selvaraj said increases in prices are not just an immediate problem, but caused by investment in agriculture and supply chain competitiveness.\n\nHe said a lot of production is still dependent on imports and when the prices go up in the international market, the country gets affected.\n\n\u201cFomca always advocates moving forward self-sufficiency so that we are not impacted by world trade or problems from other markets.\n\n\u201cWe neglect the agriculture sector and do not beat up the demand of our modern economy. We still import beef, fish and vegetables,\u201d he told TMR.\n\nHe said Malaysia needs to shift focus to agriculture production by maintaining a vibrant industry, not only for production purposes, but also to attract new generations.\n\n\u201cTo make it attractive, it must be viable and (can) provide a good income. In other countries, developing sustainable agriculture is a major stake. Why can\u2019t we do that?\u201d he added.\n\nHe also said the Malaysia Competition Commission did a market surveillance on food and they found that along the supply chain, there is a lot of market manipulation that gets people together and manipulates prices.\n\nWhile conducting the survey, \u201cthey also identified a long supply chain where the market manipulation is going on. Monopolistic behaviour makes consumers suffer\u201d.\n\n\u201cSince the information is there and a survey has been done, the government should take action towards these people who take advantage of profit gearing. It should be a continuing enforcement,\u201d he said.\n\nMalaysian Muslim Consumers Association lead activist Datuk Nadzim Johan said the government does not really play their role to address the increasing prices of essential items.\n\n\u201cIt is a big challenge, but we have an option actually. But we chose the wrong way. Why do we have to buy chillies from Thailand at RM26 per kg?\n\n\u201cOur agriculture is still lagging. Why don\u2019t we plant those vegetables ourselves?\u201d he told TMR.\n\nNadzim said the current state of Emergency needs to end immediately to tackle this issue which can lead to serious problems, such as unemployment, suicide and high debt.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the Emergency is necessary in the first place.

Najib has no privity of contract with the bank,\u201d he said.\n\nSithambaram, who was given a special licence by the attorney-general to prosecute Najib\u2019s SRC International corruption case, said \u201cthe defence has to respond to the prosecution\u2019s case on the seven charges\u201d faced by the former prime minister.\n\n\u201cThe issue of forged or unauthorised scan (of signatures) and electronic transfer is a non-starter, especially for the criminal breach of trust charges.\n\n\u201cThe issue raised is a red herring by the defence, and who would have the audacity to fix a then sitting prime minister?\u201d he asked.\n\nHe said SRC did not sue the bank for negligence or asked the financial institution to pay back the money.\n\n\u201cNo company will keep quiet if there is no proper authorisation and withdrawal of money.\u201d\n\nSithambaram said there was evidence that the SRC directors had authorised the bank to conduct electronic transfers and the bank said it had also acted based on the mandate of SRC signatories.\n\nIn fact, he said, Najib had not returned the RM42 million although he had admitted receiving the money that belonged to SRC.\n\n\u201cHe only said (he did not have) knowledge of how the money came in but we have proven the RM42 million went into his accounts,\u201d he said, adding that the prosecution was raising this issue as \u201cwe want to take the bull by the horns\u201d.\n\nNajib\u2019s lead counsel, Muhammad Shafee Abdullah, had said last week the prosecution\u2019s case would have collapsed if the evidence of one of the signatories and then SRC directors, Suboh Md Yassin, was rejected by the High Court as he had made contradictory statements.\n\nSuboh had said he had at first told Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) investigators who met him in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates on Nov 17, 2015, that the 13 signatures in the electronic fund transfer instructions to the bank were genuine.\n\nHowever, he said while being cross-examined by Shafee, he told MACC officers in Putrajaya on May 28 and 30, 2018 that his signatures could have been forged.\n\nSuboh also said he once again told MACC officers on Aug 13 and 15, 2018 that the signatures were genuine.\n\nThe defence had suggested that former SRC chief executive officer Nik Faisal Ariff Kamil could have \u201cphotoshopped\u201d (digitally manipulated) Suboh\u2019s signature in the scanned copies before sending them to the bank to carry out the instructions to transfer funds.\n\nShafee had also suggested that Nik Faisal, who has gone missing, had forged and misused Suboh\u2019s signature and put it in the hard copies.\n\nNik Faisal and Suboh were the signatories of the SRC account from which money was transferred to Gandingan Mentari, a subsidiary of SRC.\n\nThey were also signatories of the Gandingan Mentari account, where money was transferred to Ihsan Perdana, a company selected to carry out corporate social responsibility programmes for SRC.\n\nThe prosecution contends that RM42 million from Ihsan Perdana was transferred to Najib\u2019s three Ambank accounts at the Jalan Raja Chulan branch through a \u201clayering process\u201d to conceal its origin.\n\nTrial judge Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali sentenced Najib in July last year to 12 years\u2019 jail and ordered him to pay a RM210 million fine after finding him guilty on the seven counts of abuse of power, criminal breach of trust and money laundering in relation to the RM42 million belonging to SRC.\n\nHe is appealing against his conviction and

optimisation, among others\n\nBy NUR HANANI AZMAN\n\nTHE possible merger between Celcom Axiata Bhd and DiGi.com Bhd would allow the combined entity to better compete in the 5G environment via scale, improved balance sheet and operational execution.\n\nWith 5G services offered via a wholesale arrangement (5G special purpose vehicle), mobile operators no longer need to spend heavily on capital expenditure (capex) but instead focus on price and branding, said RHB Investment Bank Bhd analyst Jeffrey Tan.\n\n\u201cConsolidation would, however, see the number of operators reduced and by extension, result in lesser competition,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve.\n\nOn April 8, Axiata Group Bhd and Telenor Asia Pte Ltd announced that they are in advanced discussions on the potential merger of Celcom and Digi, with the joint entity to be known as Celcom Digi Bhd or MergeCo.\n\nAxiata and Digi will have an equal stake of about 33.1% each in MergeCo, while Axiata together with local institutional funds will own over 51% of MergeCo.\n\nThe merged entity would have a combined 19.1 million customers and total revenue of RM12.4 billion.\n\nWhether this merger fails or succeeds, Jeffrey said it is imperative for mobile operators to consider the longer-term sustainability of the industry and to collaborate in ways to ensure their continued existence in the face of digitalisation.\n\n\u201cThere are lower execution risks with this proposal in that the scope of the merger is significantly smaller and national interests are taken into consideration,\u201d he

to spend RM1.8b in subsidy\n\nby SHAHEERA AZNAM SHAH / pic by RAZAK GHAZALI\n\nTHE Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) is maintaining the monthly quota for subsidised cooking oil through the Cooking Oil Stabilisation Scheme (COSS) at 60,000 tonnes amid the spike in the refined bleached and deodorised (RBD) palm olein price this year.\n\nThe price of vegetable cooking oil has surged 83% to RM4,122 per tonne in 2021 against RM2,255 per tonne recorded last year, said Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi (picture).\n\n\u201cKPDNHEP would like to clarify that the government still maintains the quota for subsidised cooking oil at 60,000 tonnes per month for 2020 and 2021 although the price of RBD palm olein has increased by 83% to RM4,122 per tonne in 2021 compared to RM2,255 per tonne in 2020.\n\n\u201cThis is equivalent to 60 million of 1kg polybag packets, allocated for each Malaysians, including in Sarawak and Sabah, and the government is committed to maintaining the allocation,\u201d he said in a statement yesterday.\n\nNanta Linggi added that should the price of vegetable cooking oil continue to increase, the government is expected to spend RM1.8 billion in subsidy, a hefty increase from RM400 million currently.\n\n\u201cIf the RBD palm olein price continues to show an upward trend, the subsidy cost for the scheme is expected to increase from RM400 million to RM1.8 billion.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the government\u2019s decision to maintain the quotas of the COSS programme indicates the level of commitment in reducing the cost of living and safeguarding the wellbeing of the people.\n\n\u201cThe KPDNHEP Enforcement Division has been conducting comprehensive audits regularly,\u201d he said.\n\nNanta Linggi was responding to a report by the local news portal, Borneo Post Online, claiming that there is a shortage of supply of subsidised cooking oil in the market.\n\nIn addressing the illegality of the distribution of subsidised

Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) has issued 84 notices against food and beverage premises operators nationwide for charging more than RM1 for a glass of plain water.\n\nIts Deputy Minister Datuk Rosol Wahid said all the notices were issued through Ops Catut 8.0 carried out since Wednesday (April 7) following complaints from the public.\n\n\u201cThe operation will be carried out until April 15 by enforcement teams nationwide. Based on the number of notices issued, we find that this is quite a common occurrence.\n\n\u201cThis should not happen... maybe a more appropriate price would be between RM0.20 or RM0.30,\u201c he told reporters after officiating the Terengganu state-level Franchise Bay Tour Programme here today.\n\nOf the 84 notices, Kelantan recorded the highest number with 14, followed by Selangor (12), Sabah (eight), Sarawak (eight), Johor (eight), Pahang (seven), Terengganu (six), Kuala Lumpur (five), Melaka (four), Federal Territory of Labuan (three), Penang (three), Perlis (two), Perak (two) and Negeri Sembilan (two).\n\nTraders who are issued with the notice will be given two to five working days to provide the information required by KPDNHEP before further action is taken in accordance with the Price Control and Anti -Profiteering Act 2011.\n\nMeanwhile, Rosol called on more franchisors to take advantage of the Micro and Affordable Franchise Development Programme to help create better opportunities for entrepreneurs, especially those in the B40 and M40 target groups.\n\nHe said there were currently 1,091 franchise brands registered in Malaysia, of which 694 were local franchise brands.\n\n\u201cHowever, so far only 12 franchise brands have offered micro franchises and affordable franchises. The number is still too small compared to the 1,091 registered franchise brands,\u201d he said.\n\nAffordable franchises are business packages worth RM100 thousand and below, while micro franchises are worth RM50 thousand and below.\n\nRosol said KPDNHEP had allocated a total of RM5 million for the Affordable and Micro Franchise Development Programme, comprising full grants worth RM2 million offered to franchisors, and matching grants totalling RM2.5 million for those from the B40 and M40 groups looking to open a franchise.\n\nOn an unrelated matter, Rosol, who is also Hulu Terengganu MP, said KPDNHEP was monitoring motorcycle sales activities around the Klang Valley, where customers were apparently finding it difficult to purchase new two-wheelers in cash.\n\n\u201cRecently I have received complaints from customers who say they find it difficult to buy motorcycles in cash, because sellers prefer customers to purchase them in installments.\n\n\u201cIf there are reports that traders are pressuring customers, KPDNHEP can investigate. There may be offences (committed) that we can take action against, especially if traders set different prices for the purchase of motorcycles in cash or monthly installments,\u201c he said.\n\nHe added that apart from keeping the people away from the burden of debt, he also did not want them to be saddled with interest payments.\n\n\u201cI think there may be an alliance between the motor companies and finance institutions... imagine if there is a charge of 5% or 8% in interest over five years, how much will they earn (compared to the cash deal) ... if there are two different prices according to the method of purchase, this is wrong,\u201c he said. \u2014 Bernama", "keyword": ["water", "issued", "priced", "84", "franchise", "terengganu", "micro", "nationwide", "glass", "plain", "notices", "kpdnhep", "franchises", "purchase", "issues", "customers", "rm1", "worth"], "summary": "KUALA TERENGGANU: The Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) has issued 84 notices against food and beverage premises operators nationwide for charging more than RM1 for a glass of plain water.\nBased on the number of notices issued, we find that this is quite a common occurrence.\n\u201cHowever, so far only 12 franchise brands have offered micro franchises and affordable franchises.\nAffordable franchises are business packages worth RM100 thousand and below, while micro franchises are worth RM50 thousand and below.\n\u201cIf there are reports that traders are pressuring customers, KPDNHEP can investigate.", "news": "The Sun Daily", "date": "2021-04-10 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Kelantan KPDNHEP seizes 800kg of flour sold without licence", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEPdxU7tI-7bms0z3UhdRH6kqGQgEKhAIACoHCAow9sveCjC0m9YBMPDtoQM?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/kpdnKel925_NSTfield_image_socialmedia.var_1618148048.jpg", "text": "", "keyword": ["flour", "licence", "seizes", "kpdnhep", "kelantan", "800kg", "sold"], "summary": "", "news": "New Straits Times", "date": "2021-04-11 00:00:00", "language": "INDONESIA"}, {"title": "Need Refund From Online Sellers Or Chicken Prices Too High?

the state to monitor and inspect various locations such as public markets, farmers\u2019 markets and supermarkets to ensure the supply and prices of essential goods, including chickens, are stable and adequate for the Ramadan month and Hari Raya Aidilfitri.\n\nIt further said according to the National Price Council Division (BHBN)of KPDNHEP Sarawak, the selling price of standard clean chicken from January to this month is between RM7.90 and RM8.80 per kg.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the price is at normal levels and does not show any unusual increase,\u201d it pointed out in a statement

maintaining a subsidised cooking oil quota of 60,000 tonnes per month despite the increase in the price of refined, bleached and deodorised (RBD) palm oil, says Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi (picture).\n\nThis is equivalent to 60 million one-kilogramme (kg) polybag packets, with 1.5 kg allocated for every Malaysian, including in Sabah and Sarawak.\n\nNanta said RBD palm oil increased by about 83 per cent to RM4,122 per tonne this year compared to RM2,255 per tonne in 2020.\n\n\u201cThe government has also increased the allocation based on a commitment to supply 60,000 tonnes although the price of RBD palm olein has gone up,\u201d he said, adding that the government expected the cost of the subsidy scheme to increase from RM400 million to RM1.8 billion if the price of RBD palm olein continued to rise.\n\n\u201cAs such, the government\u2019s decision to maintain the quota in the Cooking Oil Stabilisation Scheme (COSS) shows the government\u2019s high commitment to reduce the cost of living and ensure the well-being of the people,\u201d he said in a statement today.\n\nThe statement was issued following news reports on alleged shortage of subsidised cooking oil in Sarawak which stemmed from the dishonest action of cooking oil packaging companies of not supplying subsidised cooking oil in prescribed quantities for distribution to supermarkets and grocery stores.\n\nThe report also suggested that KPDNHEP step up monitoring and enforcement on subsidised cooking oil packaging activities and ensure that the RM400 million cooking oil subsidy allocation this year is spent prudently.\n\nNanta said KPDNHEP\u2019s enforcement division always conducted comprehensive audits to ensure that every subsidised cooking oil production was acceptable in each of its distribution chains.\n\nFollowing the audit and stern action in tackling the leakage of subsidised cooking oil distribution, Nanta said a total of 318 cases had been recorded nationwide from 2016 to March 2021.\n\nDuring the same period, four cooking oil packaging companies were taken to task by cancelling the quotas given to them earlier, he said.\n\nOn complaints related to cooking oil in Sarawak, Nanta said a review of records found that there had been 25 complaints since 2020 until March 31 (2021) and 4,221 inspections conducted on premises selling cooking oil until yesterday (April 12).\n\nOn the sugar issue which was also touched on in the news report, Nanta said in principle, the selling price of domestic sugar was controlled at a maximum price of RM2.85 per kg for coarse refined white sugar and RM2.95 per kg for refined white sugar for retail sale.\n\nThe wholesale selling price of sugar for use in the food and beverage (F&B) industry is set at RM2.77 per kg for coarse refined white sugar and RM2.85 per kg for refined white sugar.\n\n\u201cThe difference in lower sugar prices can be enjoyed by F&B companies based on the quantity and method of purchase agreed upon with the supplier, and also depending on the price of raw sugar in the world market without government intervention,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the news report, the F&B industry now has to spend more to get refined sugar at RM2.75 per kg.\n\nNanta said local F&B companies and wholesalers could apply for permits to import refined sugar at any time of the year.\n\n\u201cEligible applications will be carefully considered by an evaluation committee represented by several relevant government agencies including the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, the Malaysian Investment Development Authority and the Royal Malaysian Customs Department, he said.\n\n\u201cThe priority of issuing import permits is to any F&B manufacturing company and wholesaler that meets the evaluation criteria set,\u201d he added.\n\nNanta said continuous monitoring would be carried out on the recipients of permits to import refined sugar to prevent misuse and misappropriation, and enforcement action would be taken against those who misused the permits to import refined sugar.", "keyword": ["sugar", "oil", "month", "fb", "white", "subsidised", "remains",

yesterday claimed that there is a shortage of subsidised 1kg pack of cooking oil due to under-production by some repackers who have been receiving government subsidies.\n\nThe former deputy minister of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) said the government had allocated RM400 million for the cooking oil price stabilisation scheme this year alone to enable the needy across Malaysia to buy the subsidised cooking oil at RM2.50.\n\n\u201cEvery year, there is government allocation to maintain the price of the 1kg subsidised cooking oil at RM2.50. The allocation for this year is RM400 million and it was also RM400 million last year.\n\n\u201cWhen PH (Pakatan Harapan) was the government, the allocation was RM720 million in 2018 and RM600 million in 2019. During our time, we made sure all this amount go to packing the subsidised cooking oil. But lately I noticed that there is a huge shortage of this 1kg cooking oil,\u201d he said during his Facebook live in e-Mart Batu Kawa here.\n\nChong, who is Stampin MP and Kota Sentosa assemblyman, claimed that some repackers had resorted to over-claiming of subsidies or under-production of subsidised cooking oil.\n\nFor instance, he said a repacker who was supposed to pack 1,500kg of cooking oil only packed 1,000kg but still claimed the subsidy amount for 1,500kg.\n\n\u201cDuring PH\u2019s time, it\u2019s very seldom that you didn\u2019t get the 1kg cooking oil in the market. But after PH is no longer the government, most of the time you can\u2019t get this 1kg cooking oil.\n\n\u201cWhy? I believe the hanky panky thing has found its way back to the system. That\u2019s why we are having this Facebook live to forewarn the government,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also called upon his former colleagues at KPDNHEP to carry out strict enforcement to ensure a stable supply of the subsidised cooking oil.\n\nWhen he was the deputy KPDNHEP minister, Chong said they kept a record of the volume repackers delivered to the retailers, who must then have a record for the ministry to cross check.\n\nWith such strict enforcement, he said the government would be able to make sure that the allocation could benefit the target groups.\n\n\u201cI think the situation is quite bad now, a lot of time you can\u2019t find the 1kg cooking oil. After all, it\u2019s RM400 million of government allocation we are talking about.\u201d\n\nChong said the previous PH government managed to bring down the price of sugar to RM1.70 or RM1.80 per kg for food and beverages (F&B) manufacturers but today, they had to fork out RM2.75 per kg.\n\nHe added that the former federal government opened up sugar import for F&B manufacturers in Sarawak.\n\nHe was glad that the current federal government had carried on the policy but some F&B manufacturers in the state had complained that their applications for sugar import had been rejected by Putrajaya.\n\n\u201c(KPDNHEP Minister Datuk) Alexandar Nanta Linggi is a Sarawakian. He can do much better than what I did as a deputy minister since he is a full minister.\n\n\u201cI will talk to Alexandar Nanta and ask him to make it easier for F&B manufacturers in Sarawak to apply for the sugar import permit,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier, Chong handed out shopping vouchers worth RM100 to about 40 needy individuals under a social programme in collaboration with e-Mart Batu Kawa to

introduced 20 initiatives since 2020 to help companies and entrepreneurs reduce the impact of Covid-19 in their businesses.\n\nOf these initiatives, three of them were also announced in the Pemerkasa agenda.\n\nSSM\u2019s first initiative in Pemerkasa was to increase the current threshold value of indebtedness under Section 466 of the Companies Act 2016 from RM10,000 to RM50,000 until Dec 31, 2020, along with the period to respond to a notice of claim by a company was also extended to six months.\n\n\u201cTaking into account the uncertainties in the global and domestic economic conditions following the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, SSM has also announced that the company\u2019s indebtedness threshold was raised to RM50,000 effective April 1, 2021, as a new permanent threshold value,\u201d said Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi in his speech during SSM\u2019s 19th Anniversary Ceremony in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.\n\nThe second initiative offers free business registration facilities to B40 group entrepreneurs and full -time IPT students who wish to venture into entrepreneurship while the third initiative was offering assistance to the disabled to register and renew their business with SSM for free.\n\nHe added SSM remains committed to helping ease the burden of the business community by implementing initiatives to extend the compound exemption for delays in renewing business registrations and delays in registering new businesses under the Business Registration Act 1956 until Dec 31 this year which will benefit over 330,000 business communities.\n\nThe minister announced this initiative on March 30, as an extension of the implementation of the compound exemption for delays in renewing business registration certificates implemented from March 17 \u2013 Dec 31, 2020, before being extended until June 30 this year.\n\nIn the same event he said SSM has spent a total of RM3.6 million in corporate zakat allocation and RM242,500 in corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives in 2020.\n\n\u201cI hope that SSM will be more successful in the future and be able to continue this noble endeavour,\u201d he added.\n\nSSM also launched the \u2018Usahawan Bijak, Usahawan Berdaftar\u2019 campaign that aims to produce ethical and trusted entrepreneurs and will be implemented throughout 2021.\n\nThe campaign is one of the methods to encourage the public, especially traders to register businesses.\n\nAll businesses need to register with SSM either under the Business Registration Act 1956 which applies in Peninsular Malaysia and the Federal Territory of Labuan or under the Companies Act 2016 and the Limited Liability Partnership Act 2012.\n\nThrough this campaign, SSM calls on all

I have very little information on her and her family as my mother would not want to share much on her sister who was \u2018given away\u2019 or maybe she really didn\u2019t know much about them as she was from another mother,\u201d Sim explained.\n\n\u201cThen 21 years ago we managed to meet up for the first time. Then Toh Puan Sri had just married Tun Pehin Sri Salahuddin. Suddenly our family size grew following the meeting for the first time between Toh Puan Sri and my mum, since their birth.\u201d\n\nAlthough Norkiah was given up for adoption to a Malay family back in the early 50s, when the situations in those days were tough with some households having more than 10 children, it was not unusual for families to give away their children (particularly girls) to young couples who were not able to conceive their own, he said.\n\n\u201cA few months after the family meeting, Tun Pehin Sri Salahuddin was appointed as the Governor of Sarawak again (for the second time) and my late auntie\u2019s life took a huge change. Her role changed drastically from a loving wife to Tun, but was elevated to First Lady of Sarawak.\n\n\u201cThe late Toh Puan Sri was fortunate because her life story would become one that is reminiscent of the Cinderella story when she met, fell in love and married Tun Pehin Sri. She was Tun Pehin Sri\u2019s second wife after his first wife had passed away,\u201d Sim added.\n\n\u201cShe was born into a poor Chinese family and given away to an equally poor Malay family and like Cinderella she ended up happy ever after in the Astana of Sarawak as the First Lady of Sarawak.\n\n\u201cShe made sure that her years as First Lady were not wasted. She started her charity works, helped and touched so many lives like the orphans, elderly and the poor. She was generous, approachable, down to earth and putting others first.\u201d\n\nSince then, she had dedicated her life to the wellbeing of others, playing her role as the mother to all Sarawakians regardless of race or creed, Sim added.\n\n(For the freshest news, join our Telegram channel)\n\n\u201cIndeed Toh Puan\u2019s life is part and parcel of Sarawak\u2019s story. Hers is similar to that of Datin Amar Dato Hajjah Juma\u2019ani Tuanku Haji Bujang, wife of the Chief Minister (Datuk Patinggi Abang Johari Tun Openg), who was also adopted by a Muslim family from a Chinese family.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy aunty and Tun Pehin Sri had brought much peace, harmony and unity of all Sarawakians. They would be joining my activities by lending their support especially during Inter-cultural Mooncake festival. They would not miss any of the annual celebrations held at Carpenter Street. They would grace dinner functions hosted by many associations that me and my late father Datuk Sim Swee Yong were involved in. Their show of love for all Sarawakians irrespective of race and religion is what makes us and Sarawakians unique and special,\u201d added Sim.\n\n\u201cShe was a shining example of our unity in diversity. Her upbringing in a Muslim and Malay family is very typical of our Sarawakian lifestyle in the early 50s and 60s when children were given for adoption due to poverty. This priceless practice is the saving grace of our bond and unity of all races in Sarawak.

Instead, let the interministerial discussion happen, then formulate a pricing index and monitor it.\n\n\u201cMake a one-year action plan, not only for festive season. Run it for a year, check every month (whether it is) working or not. If something is wrong, solve it,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve (TMR).\n\nGeorge, with 45 years of experience addressing public interest issues, said the government is not engaging consumer groups to handle the problem.\n\nHe said price hike will change consumers\u2019 purchasing patterns which activate the panic buying mode where people buy more and impact the distribution chain.\n\n\u201cThe government needs to set a competent task force with intelligent members to sit with policymakers, so they can advise the ministers after being on the ground on a plan of action that can be rolled out to address the issue.\n\n\u201cTo come out with realistic costs, we have to make sure people on the ground or people in the marketplace are not profiteering,\u201d he added.\n\nGeorge said he was part of a task force which was set up before the last election, but the committee didn\u2019t get off the ground with the change in government.\n\nMeanwhile, Federation of Malaysian Consumers Associations (Fomca) CEO Datuk Dr Paul Selvaraj said increases in prices are not just an immediate problem, but caused by investment in agriculture and supply chain competitiveness.\n\nHe said a lot of production is still dependent on imports and when the prices go up in the international market, the country gets affected.\n\n\u201cFomca always advocates moving forward self-sufficiency so that we are not impacted by world trade or problems from other markets.\n\n\u201cWe neglect the agriculture sector and do not beat up the demand of our modern economy. We still import beef, fish and vegetables,\u201d he told TMR.\n\nHe said Malaysia needs to shift focus to agriculture production by maintaining a vibrant industry, not only for production purposes, but also to attract new generations.\n\n\u201cTo make it attractive, it must be viable and (can) provide a good income. In other countries, developing sustainable agriculture is a major stake. Why can\u2019t we do that?\u201d he added.\n\nHe also said the Malaysia Competition Commission did a market surveillance on food and they found that along the supply chain, there is a lot of market manipulation that gets people together and manipulates prices.\n\nWhile conducting the survey, \u201cthey also identified a long supply chain where the market manipulation is going on. Monopolistic behaviour makes consumers suffer\u201d.\n\n\u201cSince the information is there and a survey has been done, the government should take action towards these people who take advantage of profit gearing. It should be a continuing enforcement,\u201d he said.\n\nMalaysian Muslim Consumers Association lead activist Datuk Nadzim Johan said the government does not really play their role to address the increasing prices of essential items.\n\n\u201cIt is a big challenge, but we have an option actually. But we chose the wrong way. Why do we have to buy chillies from Thailand at RM26 per kg?\n\n\u201cOur agriculture is still lagging. Why don\u2019t we plant those vegetables ourselves?\u201d he told TMR.\n\nNadzim said the current state of Emergency needs to end immediately to tackle this issue which can lead to serious problems, such as unemployment, suicide and high debt.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the Emergency is necessary in the first place.

Najib has no privity of contract with the bank,\u201d he said.\n\nSithambaram, who was given a special licence by the attorney-general to prosecute Najib\u2019s SRC International corruption case, said \u201cthe defence has to respond to the prosecution\u2019s case on the seven charges\u201d faced by the former prime minister.\n\n\u201cThe issue of forged or unauthorised scan (of signatures) and electronic transfer is a non-starter, especially for the criminal breach of trust charges.\n\n\u201cThe issue raised is a red herring by the defence, and who would have the audacity to fix a then sitting prime minister?\u201d he asked.\n\nHe said SRC did not sue the bank for negligence or asked the financial institution to pay back the money.\n\n\u201cNo company will keep quiet if there is no proper authorisation and withdrawal of money.\u201d\n\nSithambaram said there was evidence that the SRC directors had authorised the bank to conduct electronic transfers and the bank said it had also acted based on the mandate of SRC signatories.\n\nIn fact, he said, Najib had not returned the RM42 million although he had admitted receiving the money that belonged to SRC.\n\n\u201cHe only said (he did not have) knowledge of how the money came in but we have proven the RM42 million went into his accounts,\u201d he said, adding that the prosecution was raising this issue as \u201cwe want to take the bull by the horns\u201d.\n\nNajib\u2019s lead counsel, Muhammad Shafee Abdullah, had said last week the prosecution\u2019s case would have collapsed if the evidence of one of the signatories and then SRC directors, Suboh Md Yassin, was rejected by the High Court as he had made contradictory statements.\n\nSuboh had said he had at first told Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) investigators who met him in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates on Nov 17, 2015, that the 13 signatures in the electronic fund transfer instructions to the bank were genuine.\n\nHowever, he said while being cross-examined by Shafee, he told MACC officers in Putrajaya on May 28 and 30, 2018 that his signatures could have been forged.\n\nSuboh also said he once again told MACC officers on Aug 13 and 15, 2018 that the signatures were genuine.\n\nThe defence had suggested that former SRC chief executive officer Nik Faisal Ariff Kamil could have \u201cphotoshopped\u201d (digitally manipulated) Suboh\u2019s signature in the scanned copies before sending them to the bank to carry out the instructions to transfer funds.\n\nShafee had also suggested that Nik Faisal, who has gone missing, had forged and misused Suboh\u2019s signature and put it in the hard copies.\n\nNik Faisal and Suboh were the signatories of the SRC account from which money was transferred to Gandingan Mentari, a subsidiary of SRC.\n\nThey were also signatories of the Gandingan Mentari account, where money was transferred to Ihsan Perdana, a company selected to carry out corporate social responsibility programmes for SRC.\n\nThe prosecution contends that RM42 million from Ihsan Perdana was transferred to Najib\u2019s three Ambank accounts at the Jalan Raja Chulan branch through a \u201clayering process\u201d to conceal its origin.\n\nTrial judge Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali sentenced Najib in July last year to 12 years\u2019 jail and ordered him to pay a RM210 million fine after finding him guilty on the seven counts of abuse of power, criminal breach of trust and money laundering in relation to the RM42 million belonging to SRC.\n\nHe is appealing against his conviction and

optimisation, among others\n\nBy NUR HANANI AZMAN\n\nTHE possible merger between Celcom Axiata Bhd and DiGi.com Bhd would allow the combined entity to better compete in the 5G environment via scale, improved balance sheet and operational execution.\n\nWith 5G services offered via a wholesale arrangement (5G special purpose vehicle), mobile operators no longer need to spend heavily on capital expenditure (capex) but instead focus on price and branding, said RHB Investment Bank Bhd analyst Jeffrey Tan.\n\n\u201cConsolidation would, however, see the number of operators reduced and by extension, result in lesser competition,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve.\n\nOn April 8, Axiata Group Bhd and Telenor Asia Pte Ltd announced that they are in advanced discussions on the potential merger of Celcom and Digi, with the joint entity to be known as Celcom Digi Bhd or MergeCo.\n\nAxiata and Digi will have an equal stake of about 33.1% each in MergeCo, while Axiata together with local institutional funds will own over 51% of MergeCo.\n\nThe merged entity would have a combined 19.1 million customers and total revenue of RM12.4 billion.\n\nWhether this merger fails or succeeds, Jeffrey said it is imperative for mobile operators to consider the longer-term sustainability of the industry and to collaborate in ways to ensure their continued existence in the face of digitalisation.\n\n\u201cThere are lower execution risks with this proposal in that the scope of the merger is significantly smaller and national interests are taken into consideration,\u201d he

to spend RM1.8b in subsidy\n\nby SHAHEERA AZNAM SHAH / pic by RAZAK GHAZALI\n\nTHE Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) is maintaining the monthly quota for subsidised cooking oil through the Cooking Oil Stabilisation Scheme (COSS) at 60,000 tonnes amid the spike in the refined bleached and deodorised (RBD) palm olein price this year.\n\nThe price of vegetable cooking oil has surged 83% to RM4,122 per tonne in 2021 against RM2,255 per tonne recorded last year, said Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi (picture).\n\n\u201cKPDNHEP would like to clarify that the government still maintains the quota for subsidised cooking oil at 60,000 tonnes per month for 2020 and 2021 although the price of RBD palm olein has increased by 83% to RM4,122 per tonne in 2021 compared to RM2,255 per tonne in 2020.\n\n\u201cThis is equivalent to 60 million of 1kg polybag packets, allocated for each Malaysians, including in Sarawak and Sabah, and the government is committed to maintaining the allocation,\u201d he said in a statement yesterday.\n\nNanta Linggi added that should the price of vegetable cooking oil continue to increase, the government is expected to spend RM1.8 billion in subsidy, a hefty increase from RM400 million currently.\n\n\u201cIf the RBD palm olein price continues to show an upward trend, the subsidy cost for the scheme is expected to increase from RM400 million to RM1.8 billion.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the government\u2019s decision to maintain the quotas of the COSS programme indicates the level of commitment in reducing the cost of living and safeguarding the wellbeing of the people.\n\n\u201cThe KPDNHEP Enforcement Division has been conducting comprehensive audits regularly,\u201d he said.\n\nNanta Linggi was responding to a report by the local news portal, Borneo Post Online, claiming that there is a shortage of supply of subsidised cooking oil in the market.\n\nIn addressing the illegality of the distribution of subsidised

Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) has issued 84 notices against food and beverage premises operators nationwide for charging more than RM1 for a glass of plain water.\n\nIts Deputy Minister Datuk Rosol Wahid said all the notices were issued through Ops Catut 8.0 carried out since Wednesday (April 7) following complaints from the public.\n\n\u201cThe operation will be carried out until April 15 by enforcement teams nationwide. Based on the number of notices issued, we find that this is quite a common occurrence.\n\n\u201cThis should not happen... maybe a more appropriate price would be between RM0.20 or RM0.30,\u201c he told reporters after officiating the Terengganu state-level Franchise Bay Tour Programme here today.\n\nOf the 84 notices, Kelantan recorded the highest number with 14, followed by Selangor (12), Sabah (eight), Sarawak (eight), Johor (eight), Pahang (seven), Terengganu (six), Kuala Lumpur (five), Melaka (four), Federal Territory of Labuan (three), Penang (three), Perlis (two), Perak (two) and Negeri Sembilan (two).\n\nTraders who are issued with the notice will be given two to five working days to provide the information required by KPDNHEP before further action is taken in accordance with the Price Control and Anti -Profiteering Act 2011.\n\nMeanwhile, Rosol called on more franchisors to take advantage of the Micro and Affordable Franchise Development Programme to help create better opportunities for entrepreneurs, especially those in the B40 and M40 target groups.\n\nHe said there were currently 1,091 franchise brands registered in Malaysia, of which 694 were local franchise brands.\n\n\u201cHowever, so far only 12 franchise brands have offered micro franchises and affordable franchises. The number is still too small compared to the 1,091 registered franchise brands,\u201d he said.\n\nAffordable franchises are business packages worth RM100 thousand and below, while micro franchises are worth RM50 thousand and below.\n\nRosol said KPDNHEP had allocated a total of RM5 million for the Affordable and Micro Franchise Development Programme, comprising full grants worth RM2 million offered to franchisors, and matching grants totalling RM2.5 million for those from the B40 and M40 groups looking to open a franchise.\n\nOn an unrelated matter, Rosol, who is also Hulu Terengganu MP, said KPDNHEP was monitoring motorcycle sales activities around the Klang Valley, where customers were apparently finding it difficult to purchase new two-wheelers in cash.\n\n\u201cRecently I have received complaints from customers who say they find it difficult to buy motorcycles in cash, because sellers prefer customers to purchase them in installments.\n\n\u201cIf there are reports that traders are pressuring customers, KPDNHEP can investigate. There may be offences (committed) that we can take action against, especially if traders set different prices for the purchase of motorcycles in cash or monthly installments,\u201c he said.\n\nHe added that apart from keeping the people away from the burden of debt, he also did not want them to be saddled with interest payments.\n\n\u201cI think there may be an alliance between the motor companies and finance institutions... imagine if there is a charge of 5% or 8% in interest over five years, how much will they earn (compared to the cash deal) ... if there are two different prices according to the method of purchase, this is wrong,\u201c he said. \u2014 Bernama", "keyword": ["water", "issued", "priced", "84", "franchise", "terengganu", "micro", "nationwide", "glass", "plain", "notices", "kpdnhep", "franchises", "purchase", "issues", "customers", "rm1", "worth"], "summary": "KUALA TERENGGANU: The Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) has issued 84 notices against food and beverage premises operators nationwide for charging more than RM1 for a glass of plain water.\nBased on the number of notices issued, we find that this is quite a common occurrence.\n\u201cHowever, so far only 12 franchise brands have offered micro franchises and affordable franchises.\nAffordable franchises are business packages worth RM100 thousand and below, while micro franchises are worth RM50 thousand and below.\n\u201cIf there are reports that traders are pressuring customers, KPDNHEP can investigate.", "news": "The Sun Daily", "date": "2021-04-10 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Kelantan KPDNHEP seizes 800kg of flour sold without licence", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEPdxU7tI-7bms0z3UhdRH6kqGQgEKhAIACoHCAow9sveCjC0m9YBMPDtoQM?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/kpdnKel925_NSTfield_image_socialmedia.var_1618148048.jpg", "text": "", "keyword": ["flour", "licence", "seizes", "kpdnhep", "kelantan", "800kg", "sold"], "summary": "", "news": "New Straits Times", "date": "2021-04-11 00:00:00", "language": "INDONESIA"}, {"title": "Need Refund From Online Sellers Or Chicken Prices Too High?

the state to monitor and inspect various locations such as public markets, farmers\u2019 markets and supermarkets to ensure the supply and prices of essential goods, including chickens, are stable and adequate for the Ramadan month and Hari Raya Aidilfitri.\n\nIt further said according to the National Price Council Division (BHBN)of KPDNHEP Sarawak, the selling price of standard clean chicken from January to this month is between RM7.90 and RM8.80 per kg.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the price is at normal levels and does not show any unusual increase,\u201d it pointed out in a statement

maintaining a subsidised cooking oil quota of 60,000 tonnes per month despite the increase in the price of refined, bleached and deodorised (RBD) palm oil, says Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi (picture).\n\nThis is equivalent to 60 million one-kilogramme (kg) polybag packets, with 1.5 kg allocated for every Malaysian, including in Sabah and Sarawak.\n\nNanta said RBD palm oil increased by about 83 per cent to RM4,122 per tonne this year compared to RM2,255 per tonne in 2020.\n\n\u201cThe government has also increased the allocation based on a commitment to supply 60,000 tonnes although the price of RBD palm olein has gone up,\u201d he said, adding that the government expected the cost of the subsidy scheme to increase from RM400 million to RM1.8 billion if the price of RBD palm olein continued to rise.\n\n\u201cAs such, the government\u2019s decision to maintain the quota in the Cooking Oil Stabilisation Scheme (COSS) shows the government\u2019s high commitment to reduce the cost of living and ensure the well-being of the people,\u201d he said in a statement today.\n\nThe statement was issued following news reports on alleged shortage of subsidised cooking oil in Sarawak which stemmed from the dishonest action of cooking oil packaging companies of not supplying subsidised cooking oil in prescribed quantities for distribution to supermarkets and grocery stores.\n\nThe report also suggested that KPDNHEP step up monitoring and enforcement on subsidised cooking oil packaging activities and ensure that the RM400 million cooking oil subsidy allocation this year is spent prudently.\n\nNanta said KPDNHEP\u2019s enforcement division always conducted comprehensive audits to ensure that every subsidised cooking oil production was acceptable in each of its distribution chains.\n\nFollowing the audit and stern action in tackling the leakage of subsidised cooking oil distribution, Nanta said a total of 318 cases had been recorded nationwide from 2016 to March 2021.\n\nDuring the same period, four cooking oil packaging companies were taken to task by cancelling the quotas given to them earlier, he said.\n\nOn complaints related to cooking oil in Sarawak, Nanta said a review of records found that there had been 25 complaints since 2020 until March 31 (2021) and 4,221 inspections conducted on premises selling cooking oil until yesterday (April 12).\n\nOn the sugar issue which was also touched on in the news report, Nanta said in principle, the selling price of domestic sugar was controlled at a maximum price of RM2.85 per kg for coarse refined white sugar and RM2.95 per kg for refined white sugar for retail sale.\n\nThe wholesale selling price of sugar for use in the food and beverage (F&B) industry is set at RM2.77 per kg for coarse refined white sugar and RM2.85 per kg for refined white sugar.\n\n\u201cThe difference in lower sugar prices can be enjoyed by F&B companies based on the quantity and method of purchase agreed upon with the supplier, and also depending on the price of raw sugar in the world market without government intervention,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the news report, the F&B industry now has to spend more to get refined sugar at RM2.75 per kg.\n\nNanta said local F&B companies and wholesalers could apply for permits to import refined sugar at any time of the year.\n\n\u201cEligible applications will be carefully considered by an evaluation committee represented by several relevant government agencies including the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, the Malaysian Investment Development Authority and the Royal Malaysian Customs Department, he said.\n\n\u201cThe priority of issuing import permits is to any F&B manufacturing company and wholesaler that meets the evaluation criteria set,\u201d he added.\n\nNanta said continuous monitoring would be carried out on the recipients of permits to import refined sugar to prevent misuse and misappropriation, and enforcement action would be taken against those who misused the permits to import refined sugar.", "keyword": ["sugar", "oil", "month", "fb", "white", "subsidised", "remains",

yesterday claimed that there is a shortage of subsidised 1kg pack of cooking oil due to under-production by some repackers who have been receiving government subsidies.\n\nThe former deputy minister of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) said the government had allocated RM400 million for the cooking oil price stabilisation scheme this year alone to enable the needy across Malaysia to buy the subsidised cooking oil at RM2.50.\n\n\u201cEvery year, there is government allocation to maintain the price of the 1kg subsidised cooking oil at RM2.50. The allocation for this year is RM400 million and it was also RM400 million last year.\n\n\u201cWhen PH (Pakatan Harapan) was the government, the allocation was RM720 million in 2018 and RM600 million in 2019. During our time, we made sure all this amount go to packing the subsidised cooking oil. But lately I noticed that there is a huge shortage of this 1kg cooking oil,\u201d he said during his Facebook live in e-Mart Batu Kawa here.\n\nChong, who is Stampin MP and Kota Sentosa assemblyman, claimed that some repackers had resorted to over-claiming of subsidies or under-production of subsidised cooking oil.\n\nFor instance, he said a repacker who was supposed to pack 1,500kg of cooking oil only packed 1,000kg but still claimed the subsidy amount for 1,500kg.\n\n\u201cDuring PH\u2019s time, it\u2019s very seldom that you didn\u2019t get the 1kg cooking oil in the market. But after PH is no longer the government, most of the time you can\u2019t get this 1kg cooking oil.\n\n\u201cWhy? I believe the hanky panky thing has found its way back to the system. That\u2019s why we are having this Facebook live to forewarn the government,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also called upon his former colleagues at KPDNHEP to carry out strict enforcement to ensure a stable supply of the subsidised cooking oil.\n\nWhen he was the deputy KPDNHEP minister, Chong said they kept a record of the volume repackers delivered to the retailers, who must then have a record for the ministry to cross check.\n\nWith such strict enforcement, he said the government would be able to make sure that the allocation could benefit the target groups.\n\n\u201cI think the situation is quite bad now, a lot of time you can\u2019t find the 1kg cooking oil. After all, it\u2019s RM400 million of government allocation we are talking about.\u201d\n\nChong said the previous PH government managed to bring down the price of sugar to RM1.70 or RM1.80 per kg for food and beverages (F&B) manufacturers but today, they had to fork out RM2.75 per kg.\n\nHe added that the former federal government opened up sugar import for F&B manufacturers in Sarawak.\n\nHe was glad that the current federal government had carried on the policy but some F&B manufacturers in the state had complained that their applications for sugar import had been rejected by Putrajaya.\n\n\u201c(KPDNHEP Minister Datuk) Alexandar Nanta Linggi is a Sarawakian. He can do much better than what I did as a deputy minister since he is a full minister.\n\n\u201cI will talk to Alexandar Nanta and ask him to make it easier for F&B manufacturers in Sarawak to apply for the sugar import permit,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier, Chong handed out shopping vouchers worth RM100 to about 40 needy individuals under a social programme in collaboration with e-Mart Batu Kawa to

introduced 20 initiatives since 2020 to help companies and entrepreneurs reduce the impact of Covid-19 in their businesses.\n\nOf these initiatives, three of them were also announced in the Pemerkasa agenda.\n\nSSM\u2019s first initiative in Pemerkasa was to increase the current threshold value of indebtedness under Section 466 of the Companies Act 2016 from RM10,000 to RM50,000 until Dec 31, 2020, along with the period to respond to a notice of claim by a company was also extended to six months.\n\n\u201cTaking into account the uncertainties in the global and domestic economic conditions following the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, SSM has also announced that the company\u2019s indebtedness threshold was raised to RM50,000 effective April 1, 2021, as a new permanent threshold value,\u201d said Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi in his speech during SSM\u2019s 19th Anniversary Ceremony in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.\n\nThe second initiative offers free business registration facilities to B40 group entrepreneurs and full -time IPT students who wish to venture into entrepreneurship while the third initiative was offering assistance to the disabled to register and renew their business with SSM for free.\n\nHe added SSM remains committed to helping ease the burden of the business community by implementing initiatives to extend the compound exemption for delays in renewing business registrations and delays in registering new businesses under the Business Registration Act 1956 until Dec 31 this year which will benefit over 330,000 business communities.\n\nThe minister announced this initiative on March 30, as an extension of the implementation of the compound exemption for delays in renewing business registration certificates implemented from March 17 \u2013 Dec 31, 2020, before being extended until June 30 this year.\n\nIn the same event he said SSM has spent a total of RM3.6 million in corporate zakat allocation and RM242,500 in corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives in 2020.\n\n\u201cI hope that SSM will be more successful in the future and be able to continue this noble endeavour,\u201d he added.\n\nSSM also launched the \u2018Usahawan Bijak, Usahawan Berdaftar\u2019 campaign that aims to produce ethical and trusted entrepreneurs and will be implemented throughout 2021.\n\nThe campaign is one of the methods to encourage the public, especially traders to register businesses.\n\nAll businesses need to register with SSM either under the Business Registration Act 1956 which applies in Peninsular Malaysia and the Federal Territory of Labuan or under the Companies Act 2016 and the Limited Liability Partnership Act 2012.\n\nThrough this campaign, SSM calls on all

I have very little information on her and her family as my mother would not want to share much on her sister who was \u2018given away\u2019 or maybe she really didn\u2019t know much about them as she was from another mother,\u201d Sim explained.\n\n\u201cThen 21 years ago we managed to meet up for the first time. Then Toh Puan Sri had just married Tun Pehin Sri Salahuddin. Suddenly our family size grew following the meeting for the first time between Toh Puan Sri and my mum, since their birth.\u201d\n\nAlthough Norkiah was given up for adoption to a Malay family back in the early 50s, when the situations in those days were tough with some households having more than 10 children, it was not unusual for families to give away their children (particularly girls) to young couples who were not able to conceive their own, he said.\n\n\u201cA few months after the family meeting, Tun Pehin Sri Salahuddin was appointed as the Governor of Sarawak again (for the second time) and my late auntie\u2019s life took a huge change. Her role changed drastically from a loving wife to Tun, but was elevated to First Lady of Sarawak.\n\n\u201cThe late Toh Puan Sri was fortunate because her life story would become one that is reminiscent of the Cinderella story when she met, fell in love and married Tun Pehin Sri. She was Tun Pehin Sri\u2019s second wife after his first wife had passed away,\u201d Sim added.\n\n\u201cShe was born into a poor Chinese family and given away to an equally poor Malay family and like Cinderella she ended up happy ever after in the Astana of Sarawak as the First Lady of Sarawak.\n\n\u201cShe made sure that her years as First Lady were not wasted. She started her charity works, helped and touched so many lives like the orphans, elderly and the poor. She was generous, approachable, down to earth and putting others first.\u201d\n\nSince then, she had dedicated her life to the wellbeing of others, playing her role as the mother to all Sarawakians regardless of race or creed, Sim added.\n\n(For the freshest news, join our Telegram channel)\n\n\u201cIndeed Toh Puan\u2019s life is part and parcel of Sarawak\u2019s story. Hers is similar to that of Datin Amar Dato Hajjah Juma\u2019ani Tuanku Haji Bujang, wife of the Chief Minister (Datuk Patinggi Abang Johari Tun Openg), who was also adopted by a Muslim family from a Chinese family.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy aunty and Tun Pehin Sri had brought much peace, harmony and unity of all Sarawakians. They would be joining my activities by lending their support especially during Inter-cultural Mooncake festival. They would not miss any of the annual celebrations held at Carpenter Street. They would grace dinner functions hosted by many associations that me and my late father Datuk Sim Swee Yong were involved in. Their show of love for all Sarawakians irrespective of race and religion is what makes us and Sarawakians unique and special,\u201d added Sim.\n\n\u201cShe was a shining example of our unity in diversity. Her upbringing in a Muslim and Malay family is very typical of our Sarawakian lifestyle in the early 50s and 60s when children were given for adoption due to poverty. This priceless practice is the saving grace of our bond and unity of all races in Sarawak.

Instead, let the interministerial discussion happen, then formulate a pricing index and monitor it.\n\n\u201cMake a one-year action plan, not only for festive season. Run it for a year, check every month (whether it is) working or not. If something is wrong, solve it,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve (TMR).\n\nGeorge, with 45 years of experience addressing public interest issues, said the government is not engaging consumer groups to handle the problem.\n\nHe said price hike will change consumers\u2019 purchasing patterns which activate the panic buying mode where people buy more and impact the distribution chain.\n\n\u201cThe government needs to set a competent task force with intelligent members to sit with policymakers, so they can advise the ministers after being on the ground on a plan of action that can be rolled out to address the issue.\n\n\u201cTo come out with realistic costs, we have to make sure people on the ground or people in the marketplace are not profiteering,\u201d he added.\n\nGeorge said he was part of a task force which was set up before the last election, but the committee didn\u2019t get off the ground with the change in government.\n\nMeanwhile, Federation of Malaysian Consumers Associations (Fomca) CEO Datuk Dr Paul Selvaraj said increases in prices are not just an immediate problem, but caused by investment in agriculture and supply chain competitiveness.\n\nHe said a lot of production is still dependent on imports and when the prices go up in the international market, the country gets affected.\n\n\u201cFomca always advocates moving forward self-sufficiency so that we are not impacted by world trade or problems from other markets.\n\n\u201cWe neglect the agriculture sector and do not beat up the demand of our modern economy. We still import beef, fish and vegetables,\u201d he told TMR.\n\nHe said Malaysia needs to shift focus to agriculture production by maintaining a vibrant industry, not only for production purposes, but also to attract new generations.\n\n\u201cTo make it attractive, it must be viable and (can) provide a good income. In other countries, developing sustainable agriculture is a major stake. Why can\u2019t we do that?\u201d he added.\n\nHe also said the Malaysia Competition Commission did a market surveillance on food and they found that along the supply chain, there is a lot of market manipulation that gets people together and manipulates prices.\n\nWhile conducting the survey, \u201cthey also identified a long supply chain where the market manipulation is going on. Monopolistic behaviour makes consumers suffer\u201d.\n\n\u201cSince the information is there and a survey has been done, the government should take action towards these people who take advantage of profit gearing. It should be a continuing enforcement,\u201d he said.\n\nMalaysian Muslim Consumers Association lead activist Datuk Nadzim Johan said the government does not really play their role to address the increasing prices of essential items.\n\n\u201cIt is a big challenge, but we have an option actually. But we chose the wrong way. Why do we have to buy chillies from Thailand at RM26 per kg?\n\n\u201cOur agriculture is still lagging. Why don\u2019t we plant those vegetables ourselves?\u201d he told TMR.\n\nNadzim said the current state of Emergency needs to end immediately to tackle this issue which can lead to serious problems, such as unemployment, suicide and high debt.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the Emergency is necessary in the first place.

Najib has no privity of contract with the bank,\u201d he said.\n\nSithambaram, who was given a special licence by the attorney-general to prosecute Najib\u2019s SRC International corruption case, said \u201cthe defence has to respond to the prosecution\u2019s case on the seven charges\u201d faced by the former prime minister.\n\n\u201cThe issue of forged or unauthorised scan (of signatures) and electronic transfer is a non-starter, especially for the criminal breach of trust charges.\n\n\u201cThe issue raised is a red herring by the defence, and who would have the audacity to fix a then sitting prime minister?\u201d he asked.\n\nHe said SRC did not sue the bank for negligence or asked the financial institution to pay back the money.\n\n\u201cNo company will keep quiet if there is no proper authorisation and withdrawal of money.\u201d\n\nSithambaram said there was evidence that the SRC directors had authorised the bank to conduct electronic transfers and the bank said it had also acted based on the mandate of SRC signatories.\n\nIn fact, he said, Najib had not returned the RM42 million although he had admitted receiving the money that belonged to SRC.\n\n\u201cHe only said (he did not have) knowledge of how the money came in but we have proven the RM42 million went into his accounts,\u201d he said, adding that the prosecution was raising this issue as \u201cwe want to take the bull by the horns\u201d.\n\nNajib\u2019s lead counsel, Muhammad Shafee Abdullah, had said last week the prosecution\u2019s case would have collapsed if the evidence of one of the signatories and then SRC directors, Suboh Md Yassin, was rejected by the High Court as he had made contradictory statements.\n\nSuboh had said he had at first told Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) investigators who met him in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates on Nov 17, 2015, that the 13 signatures in the electronic fund transfer instructions to the bank were genuine.\n\nHowever, he said while being cross-examined by Shafee, he told MACC officers in Putrajaya on May 28 and 30, 2018 that his signatures could have been forged.\n\nSuboh also said he once again told MACC officers on Aug 13 and 15, 2018 that the signatures were genuine.\n\nThe defence had suggested that former SRC chief executive officer Nik Faisal Ariff Kamil could have \u201cphotoshopped\u201d (digitally manipulated) Suboh\u2019s signature in the scanned copies before sending them to the bank to carry out the instructions to transfer funds.\n\nShafee had also suggested that Nik Faisal, who has gone missing, had forged and misused Suboh\u2019s signature and put it in the hard copies.\n\nNik Faisal and Suboh were the signatories of the SRC account from which money was transferred to Gandingan Mentari, a subsidiary of SRC.\n\nThey were also signatories of the Gandingan Mentari account, where money was transferred to Ihsan Perdana, a company selected to carry out corporate social responsibility programmes for SRC.\n\nThe prosecution contends that RM42 million from Ihsan Perdana was transferred to Najib\u2019s three Ambank accounts at the Jalan Raja Chulan branch through a \u201clayering process\u201d to conceal its origin.\n\nTrial judge Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali sentenced Najib in July last year to 12 years\u2019 jail and ordered him to pay a RM210 million fine after finding him guilty on the seven counts of abuse of power, criminal breach of trust and money laundering in relation to the RM42 million belonging to SRC.\n\nHe is appealing against his conviction and

optimisation, among others\n\nBy NUR HANANI AZMAN\n\nTHE possible merger between Celcom Axiata Bhd and DiGi.com Bhd would allow the combined entity to better compete in the 5G environment via scale, improved balance sheet and operational execution.\n\nWith 5G services offered via a wholesale arrangement (5G special purpose vehicle), mobile operators no longer need to spend heavily on capital expenditure (capex) but instead focus on price and branding, said RHB Investment Bank Bhd analyst Jeffrey Tan.\n\n\u201cConsolidation would, however, see the number of operators reduced and by extension, result in lesser competition,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve.\n\nOn April 8, Axiata Group Bhd and Telenor Asia Pte Ltd announced that they are in advanced discussions on the potential merger of Celcom and Digi, with the joint entity to be known as Celcom Digi Bhd or MergeCo.\n\nAxiata and Digi will have an equal stake of about 33.1% each in MergeCo, while Axiata together with local institutional funds will own over 51% of MergeCo.\n\nThe merged entity would have a combined 19.1 million customers and total revenue of RM12.4 billion.\n\nWhether this merger fails or succeeds, Jeffrey said it is imperative for mobile operators to consider the longer-term sustainability of the industry and to collaborate in ways to ensure their continued existence in the face of digitalisation.\n\n\u201cThere are lower execution risks with this proposal in that the scope of the merger is significantly smaller and national interests are taken into consideration,\u201d he

to spend RM1.8b in subsidy\n\nby SHAHEERA AZNAM SHAH / pic by RAZAK GHAZALI\n\nTHE Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) is maintaining the monthly quota for subsidised cooking oil through the Cooking Oil Stabilisation Scheme (COSS) at 60,000 tonnes amid the spike in the refined bleached and deodorised (RBD) palm olein price this year.\n\nThe price of vegetable cooking oil has surged 83% to RM4,122 per tonne in 2021 against RM2,255 per tonne recorded last year, said Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi (picture).\n\n\u201cKPDNHEP would like to clarify that the government still maintains the quota for subsidised cooking oil at 60,000 tonnes per month for 2020 and 2021 although the price of RBD palm olein has increased by 83% to RM4,122 per tonne in 2021 compared to RM2,255 per tonne in 2020.\n\n\u201cThis is equivalent to 60 million of 1kg polybag packets, allocated for each Malaysians, including in Sarawak and Sabah, and the government is committed to maintaining the allocation,\u201d he said in a statement yesterday.\n\nNanta Linggi added that should the price of vegetable cooking oil continue to increase, the government is expected to spend RM1.8 billion in subsidy, a hefty increase from RM400 million currently.\n\n\u201cIf the RBD palm olein price continues to show an upward trend, the subsidy cost for the scheme is expected to increase from RM400 million to RM1.8 billion.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the government\u2019s decision to maintain the quotas of the COSS programme indicates the level of commitment in reducing the cost of living and safeguarding the wellbeing of the people.\n\n\u201cThe KPDNHEP Enforcement Division has been conducting comprehensive audits regularly,\u201d he said.\n\nNanta Linggi was responding to a report by the local news portal, Borneo Post Online, claiming that there is a shortage of supply of subsidised cooking oil in the market.\n\nIn addressing the illegality of the distribution of subsidised

Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) has issued 84 notices against food and beverage premises operators nationwide for charging more than RM1 for a glass of plain water.\n\nIts Deputy Minister Datuk Rosol Wahid said all the notices were issued through Ops Catut 8.0 carried out since Wednesday (April 7) following complaints from the public.\n\n\u201cThe operation will be carried out until April 15 by enforcement teams nationwide. Based on the number of notices issued, we find that this is quite a common occurrence.\n\n\u201cThis should not happen... maybe a more appropriate price would be between RM0.20 or RM0.30,\u201c he told reporters after officiating the Terengganu state-level Franchise Bay Tour Programme here today.\n\nOf the 84 notices, Kelantan recorded the highest number with 14, followed by Selangor (12), Sabah (eight), Sarawak (eight), Johor (eight), Pahang (seven), Terengganu (six), Kuala Lumpur (five), Melaka (four), Federal Territory of Labuan (three), Penang (three), Perlis (two), Perak (two) and Negeri Sembilan (two).\n\nTraders who are issued with the notice will be given two to five working days to provide the information required by KPDNHEP before further action is taken in accordance with the Price Control and Anti -Profiteering Act 2011.\n\nMeanwhile, Rosol called on more franchisors to take advantage of the Micro and Affordable Franchise Development Programme to help create better opportunities for entrepreneurs, especially those in the B40 and M40 target groups.\n\nHe said there were currently 1,091 franchise brands registered in Malaysia, of which 694 were local franchise brands.\n\n\u201cHowever, so far only 12 franchise brands have offered micro franchises and affordable franchises. The number is still too small compared to the 1,091 registered franchise brands,\u201d he said.\n\nAffordable franchises are business packages worth RM100 thousand and below, while micro franchises are worth RM50 thousand and below.\n\nRosol said KPDNHEP had allocated a total of RM5 million for the Affordable and Micro Franchise Development Programme, comprising full grants worth RM2 million offered to franchisors, and matching grants totalling RM2.5 million for those from the B40 and M40 groups looking to open a franchise.\n\nOn an unrelated matter, Rosol, who is also Hulu Terengganu MP, said KPDNHEP was monitoring motorcycle sales activities around the Klang Valley, where customers were apparently finding it difficult to purchase new two-wheelers in cash.\n\n\u201cRecently I have received complaints from customers who say they find it difficult to buy motorcycles in cash, because sellers prefer customers to purchase them in installments.\n\n\u201cIf there are reports that traders are pressuring customers, KPDNHEP can investigate. There may be offences (committed) that we can take action against, especially if traders set different prices for the purchase of motorcycles in cash or monthly installments,\u201c he said.\n\nHe added that apart from keeping the people away from the burden of debt, he also did not want them to be saddled with interest payments.\n\n\u201cI think there may be an alliance between the motor companies and finance institutions... imagine if there is a charge of 5% or 8% in interest over five years, how much will they earn (compared to the cash deal) ... if there are two different prices according to the method of purchase, this is wrong,\u201c he said. \u2014 Bernama", "keyword": ["water", "issued", "priced", "84", "franchise", "terengganu", "micro", "nationwide", "glass", "plain", "notices", "kpdnhep", "franchises", "purchase", "issues", "customers", "rm1", "worth"], "summary": "KUALA TERENGGANU: The Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) has issued 84 notices against food and beverage premises operators nationwide for charging more than RM1 for a glass of plain water.\nBased on the number of notices issued, we find that this is quite a common occurrence.\n\u201cHowever, so far only 12 franchise brands have offered micro franchises and affordable franchises.\nAffordable franchises are business packages worth RM100 thousand and below, while micro franchises are worth RM50 thousand and below.\n\u201cIf there are reports that traders are pressuring customers, KPDNHEP can investigate.", "news": "The Sun Daily", "date": "2021-04-10 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Kelantan KPDNHEP seizes 800kg of flour sold without licence", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEPdxU7tI-7bms0z3UhdRH6kqGQgEKhAIACoHCAow9sveCjC0m9YBMPDtoQM?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/kpdnKel925_NSTfield_image_socialmedia.var_1618148048.jpg", "text": "", "keyword": ["flour", "licence", "seizes", "kpdnhep", "kelantan", "800kg", "sold"], "summary": "", "news": "New Straits Times", "date": "2021-04-11 00:00:00", "language": "INDONESIA"}, {"title": "Need Refund From Online Sellers Or Chicken Prices Too High?

the state to monitor and inspect various locations such as public markets, farmers\u2019 markets and supermarkets to ensure the supply and prices of essential goods, including chickens, are stable and adequate for the Ramadan month and Hari Raya Aidilfitri.\n\nIt further said according to the National Price Council Division (BHBN)of KPDNHEP Sarawak, the selling price of standard clean chicken from January to this month is between RM7.90 and RM8.80 per kg.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the price is at normal levels and does not show any unusual increase,\u201d it pointed out in a statement

maintaining a subsidised cooking oil quota of 60,000 tonnes per month despite the increase in the price of refined, bleached and deodorised (RBD) palm oil, says Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi (picture).\n\nThis is equivalent to 60 million one-kilogramme (kg) polybag packets, with 1.5 kg allocated for every Malaysian, including in Sabah and Sarawak.\n\nNanta said RBD palm oil increased by about 83 per cent to RM4,122 per tonne this year compared to RM2,255 per tonne in 2020.\n\n\u201cThe government has also increased the allocation based on a commitment to supply 60,000 tonnes although the price of RBD palm olein has gone up,\u201d he said, adding that the government expected the cost of the subsidy scheme to increase from RM400 million to RM1.8 billion if the price of RBD palm olein continued to rise.\n\n\u201cAs such, the government\u2019s decision to maintain the quota in the Cooking Oil Stabilisation Scheme (COSS) shows the government\u2019s high commitment to reduce the cost of living and ensure the well-being of the people,\u201d he said in a statement today.\n\nThe statement was issued following news reports on alleged shortage of subsidised cooking oil in Sarawak which stemmed from the dishonest action of cooking oil packaging companies of not supplying subsidised cooking oil in prescribed quantities for distribution to supermarkets and grocery stores.\n\nThe report also suggested that KPDNHEP step up monitoring and enforcement on subsidised cooking oil packaging activities and ensure that the RM400 million cooking oil subsidy allocation this year is spent prudently.\n\nNanta said KPDNHEP\u2019s enforcement division always conducted comprehensive audits to ensure that every subsidised cooking oil production was acceptable in each of its distribution chains.\n\nFollowing the audit and stern action in tackling the leakage of subsidised cooking oil distribution, Nanta said a total of 318 cases had been recorded nationwide from 2016 to March 2021.\n\nDuring the same period, four cooking oil packaging companies were taken to task by cancelling the quotas given to them earlier, he said.\n\nOn complaints related to cooking oil in Sarawak, Nanta said a review of records found that there had been 25 complaints since 2020 until March 31 (2021) and 4,221 inspections conducted on premises selling cooking oil until yesterday (April 12).\n\nOn the sugar issue which was also touched on in the news report, Nanta said in principle, the selling price of domestic sugar was controlled at a maximum price of RM2.85 per kg for coarse refined white sugar and RM2.95 per kg for refined white sugar for retail sale.\n\nThe wholesale selling price of sugar for use in the food and beverage (F&B) industry is set at RM2.77 per kg for coarse refined white sugar and RM2.85 per kg for refined white sugar.\n\n\u201cThe difference in lower sugar prices can be enjoyed by F&B companies based on the quantity and method of purchase agreed upon with the supplier, and also depending on the price of raw sugar in the world market without government intervention,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the news report, the F&B industry now has to spend more to get refined sugar at RM2.75 per kg.\n\nNanta said local F&B companies and wholesalers could apply for permits to import refined sugar at any time of the year.\n\n\u201cEligible applications will be carefully considered by an evaluation committee represented by several relevant government agencies including the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, the Malaysian Investment Development Authority and the Royal Malaysian Customs Department, he said.\n\n\u201cThe priority of issuing import permits is to any F&B manufacturing company and wholesaler that meets the evaluation criteria set,\u201d he added.\n\nNanta said continuous monitoring would be carried out on the recipients of permits to import refined sugar to prevent misuse and misappropriation, and enforcement action would be taken against those who misused the permits to import refined sugar.", "keyword": ["sugar", "oil", "month", "fb", "white", "subsidised", "remains",

yesterday claimed that there is a shortage of subsidised 1kg pack of cooking oil due to under-production by some repackers who have been receiving government subsidies.\n\nThe former deputy minister of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) said the government had allocated RM400 million for the cooking oil price stabilisation scheme this year alone to enable the needy across Malaysia to buy the subsidised cooking oil at RM2.50.\n\n\u201cEvery year, there is government allocation to maintain the price of the 1kg subsidised cooking oil at RM2.50. The allocation for this year is RM400 million and it was also RM400 million last year.\n\n\u201cWhen PH (Pakatan Harapan) was the government, the allocation was RM720 million in 2018 and RM600 million in 2019. During our time, we made sure all this amount go to packing the subsidised cooking oil. But lately I noticed that there is a huge shortage of this 1kg cooking oil,\u201d he said during his Facebook live in e-Mart Batu Kawa here.\n\nChong, who is Stampin MP and Kota Sentosa assemblyman, claimed that some repackers had resorted to over-claiming of subsidies or under-production of subsidised cooking oil.\n\nFor instance, he said a repacker who was supposed to pack 1,500kg of cooking oil only packed 1,000kg but still claimed the subsidy amount for 1,500kg.\n\n\u201cDuring PH\u2019s time, it\u2019s very seldom that you didn\u2019t get the 1kg cooking oil in the market. But after PH is no longer the government, most of the time you can\u2019t get this 1kg cooking oil.\n\n\u201cWhy? I believe the hanky panky thing has found its way back to the system. That\u2019s why we are having this Facebook live to forewarn the government,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also called upon his former colleagues at KPDNHEP to carry out strict enforcement to ensure a stable supply of the subsidised cooking oil.\n\nWhen he was the deputy KPDNHEP minister, Chong said they kept a record of the volume repackers delivered to the retailers, who must then have a record for the ministry to cross check.\n\nWith such strict enforcement, he said the government would be able to make sure that the allocation could benefit the target groups.\n\n\u201cI think the situation is quite bad now, a lot of time you can\u2019t find the 1kg cooking oil. After all, it\u2019s RM400 million of government allocation we are talking about.\u201d\n\nChong said the previous PH government managed to bring down the price of sugar to RM1.70 or RM1.80 per kg for food and beverages (F&B) manufacturers but today, they had to fork out RM2.75 per kg.\n\nHe added that the former federal government opened up sugar import for F&B manufacturers in Sarawak.\n\nHe was glad that the current federal government had carried on the policy but some F&B manufacturers in the state had complained that their applications for sugar import had been rejected by Putrajaya.\n\n\u201c(KPDNHEP Minister Datuk) Alexandar Nanta Linggi is a Sarawakian. He can do much better than what I did as a deputy minister since he is a full minister.\n\n\u201cI will talk to Alexandar Nanta and ask him to make it easier for F&B manufacturers in Sarawak to apply for the sugar import permit,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier, Chong handed out shopping vouchers worth RM100 to about 40 needy individuals under a social programme in collaboration with e-Mart Batu Kawa to

introduced 20 initiatives since 2020 to help companies and entrepreneurs reduce the impact of Covid-19 in their businesses.\n\nOf these initiatives, three of them were also announced in the Pemerkasa agenda.\n\nSSM\u2019s first initiative in Pemerkasa was to increase the current threshold value of indebtedness under Section 466 of the Companies Act 2016 from RM10,000 to RM50,000 until Dec 31, 2020, along with the period to respond to a notice of claim by a company was also extended to six months.\n\n\u201cTaking into account the uncertainties in the global and domestic economic conditions following the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, SSM has also announced that the company\u2019s indebtedness threshold was raised to RM50,000 effective April 1, 2021, as a new permanent threshold value,\u201d said Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi in his speech during SSM\u2019s 19th Anniversary Ceremony in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.\n\nThe second initiative offers free business registration facilities to B40 group entrepreneurs and full -time IPT students who wish to venture into entrepreneurship while the third initiative was offering assistance to the disabled to register and renew their business with SSM for free.\n\nHe added SSM remains committed to helping ease the burden of the business community by implementing initiatives to extend the compound exemption for delays in renewing business registrations and delays in registering new businesses under the Business Registration Act 1956 until Dec 31 this year which will benefit over 330,000 business communities.\n\nThe minister announced this initiative on March 30, as an extension of the implementation of the compound exemption for delays in renewing business registration certificates implemented from March 17 \u2013 Dec 31, 2020, before being extended until June 30 this year.\n\nIn the same event he said SSM has spent a total of RM3.6 million in corporate zakat allocation and RM242,500 in corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives in 2020.\n\n\u201cI hope that SSM will be more successful in the future and be able to continue this noble endeavour,\u201d he added.\n\nSSM also launched the \u2018Usahawan Bijak, Usahawan Berdaftar\u2019 campaign that aims to produce ethical and trusted entrepreneurs and will be implemented throughout 2021.\n\nThe campaign is one of the methods to encourage the public, especially traders to register businesses.\n\nAll businesses need to register with SSM either under the Business Registration Act 1956 which applies in Peninsular Malaysia and the Federal Territory of Labuan or under the Companies Act 2016 and the Limited Liability Partnership Act 2012.\n\nThrough this campaign, SSM calls on all

I have very little information on her and her family as my mother would not want to share much on her sister who was \u2018given away\u2019 or maybe she really didn\u2019t know much about them as she was from another mother,\u201d Sim explained.\n\n\u201cThen 21 years ago we managed to meet up for the first time. Then Toh Puan Sri had just married Tun Pehin Sri Salahuddin. Suddenly our family size grew following the meeting for the first time between Toh Puan Sri and my mum, since their birth.\u201d\n\nAlthough Norkiah was given up for adoption to a Malay family back in the early 50s, when the situations in those days were tough with some households having more than 10 children, it was not unusual for families to give away their children (particularly girls) to young couples who were not able to conceive their own, he said.\n\n\u201cA few months after the family meeting, Tun Pehin Sri Salahuddin was appointed as the Governor of Sarawak again (for the second time) and my late auntie\u2019s life took a huge change. Her role changed drastically from a loving wife to Tun, but was elevated to First Lady of Sarawak.\n\n\u201cThe late Toh Puan Sri was fortunate because her life story would become one that is reminiscent of the Cinderella story when she met, fell in love and married Tun Pehin Sri. She was Tun Pehin Sri\u2019s second wife after his first wife had passed away,\u201d Sim added.\n\n\u201cShe was born into a poor Chinese family and given away to an equally poor Malay family and like Cinderella she ended up happy ever after in the Astana of Sarawak as the First Lady of Sarawak.\n\n\u201cShe made sure that her years as First Lady were not wasted. She started her charity works, helped and touched so many lives like the orphans, elderly and the poor. She was generous, approachable, down to earth and putting others first.\u201d\n\nSince then, she had dedicated her life to the wellbeing of others, playing her role as the mother to all Sarawakians regardless of race or creed, Sim added.\n\n(For the freshest news, join our Telegram channel)\n\n\u201cIndeed Toh Puan\u2019s life is part and parcel of Sarawak\u2019s story. Hers is similar to that of Datin Amar Dato Hajjah Juma\u2019ani Tuanku Haji Bujang, wife of the Chief Minister (Datuk Patinggi Abang Johari Tun Openg), who was also adopted by a Muslim family from a Chinese family.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy aunty and Tun Pehin Sri had brought much peace, harmony and unity of all Sarawakians. They would be joining my activities by lending their support especially during Inter-cultural Mooncake festival. They would not miss any of the annual celebrations held at Carpenter Street. They would grace dinner functions hosted by many associations that me and my late father Datuk Sim Swee Yong were involved in. Their show of love for all Sarawakians irrespective of race and religion is what makes us and Sarawakians unique and special,\u201d added Sim.\n\n\u201cShe was a shining example of our unity in diversity. Her upbringing in a Muslim and Malay family is very typical of our Sarawakian lifestyle in the early 50s and 60s when children were given for adoption due to poverty. This priceless practice is the saving grace of our bond and unity of all races in Sarawak.

Instead, let the interministerial discussion happen, then formulate a pricing index and monitor it.\n\n\u201cMake a one-year action plan, not only for festive season. Run it for a year, check every month (whether it is) working or not. If something is wrong, solve it,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve (TMR).\n\nGeorge, with 45 years of experience addressing public interest issues, said the government is not engaging consumer groups to handle the problem.\n\nHe said price hike will change consumers\u2019 purchasing patterns which activate the panic buying mode where people buy more and impact the distribution chain.\n\n\u201cThe government needs to set a competent task force with intelligent members to sit with policymakers, so they can advise the ministers after being on the ground on a plan of action that can be rolled out to address the issue.\n\n\u201cTo come out with realistic costs, we have to make sure people on the ground or people in the marketplace are not profiteering,\u201d he added.\n\nGeorge said he was part of a task force which was set up before the last election, but the committee didn\u2019t get off the ground with the change in government.\n\nMeanwhile, Federation of Malaysian Consumers Associations (Fomca) CEO Datuk Dr Paul Selvaraj said increases in prices are not just an immediate problem, but caused by investment in agriculture and supply chain competitiveness.\n\nHe said a lot of production is still dependent on imports and when the prices go up in the international market, the country gets affected.\n\n\u201cFomca always advocates moving forward self-sufficiency so that we are not impacted by world trade or problems from other markets.\n\n\u201cWe neglect the agriculture sector and do not beat up the demand of our modern economy. We still import beef, fish and vegetables,\u201d he told TMR.\n\nHe said Malaysia needs to shift focus to agriculture production by maintaining a vibrant industry, not only for production purposes, but also to attract new generations.\n\n\u201cTo make it attractive, it must be viable and (can) provide a good income. In other countries, developing sustainable agriculture is a major stake. Why can\u2019t we do that?\u201d he added.\n\nHe also said the Malaysia Competition Commission did a market surveillance on food and they found that along the supply chain, there is a lot of market manipulation that gets people together and manipulates prices.\n\nWhile conducting the survey, \u201cthey also identified a long supply chain where the market manipulation is going on. Monopolistic behaviour makes consumers suffer\u201d.\n\n\u201cSince the information is there and a survey has been done, the government should take action towards these people who take advantage of profit gearing. It should be a continuing enforcement,\u201d he said.\n\nMalaysian Muslim Consumers Association lead activist Datuk Nadzim Johan said the government does not really play their role to address the increasing prices of essential items.\n\n\u201cIt is a big challenge, but we have an option actually. But we chose the wrong way. Why do we have to buy chillies from Thailand at RM26 per kg?\n\n\u201cOur agriculture is still lagging. Why don\u2019t we plant those vegetables ourselves?\u201d he told TMR.\n\nNadzim said the current state of Emergency needs to end immediately to tackle this issue which can lead to serious problems, such as unemployment, suicide and high debt.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the Emergency is necessary in the first place.

Najib has no privity of contract with the bank,\u201d he said.\n\nSithambaram, who was given a special licence by the attorney-general to prosecute Najib\u2019s SRC International corruption case, said \u201cthe defence has to respond to the prosecution\u2019s case on the seven charges\u201d faced by the former prime minister.\n\n\u201cThe issue of forged or unauthorised scan (of signatures) and electronic transfer is a non-starter, especially for the criminal breach of trust charges.\n\n\u201cThe issue raised is a red herring by the defence, and who would have the audacity to fix a then sitting prime minister?\u201d he asked.\n\nHe said SRC did not sue the bank for negligence or asked the financial institution to pay back the money.\n\n\u201cNo company will keep quiet if there is no proper authorisation and withdrawal of money.\u201d\n\nSithambaram said there was evidence that the SRC directors had authorised the bank to conduct electronic transfers and the bank said it had also acted based on the mandate of SRC signatories.\n\nIn fact, he said, Najib had not returned the RM42 million although he had admitted receiving the money that belonged to SRC.\n\n\u201cHe only said (he did not have) knowledge of how the money came in but we have proven the RM42 million went into his accounts,\u201d he said, adding that the prosecution was raising this issue as \u201cwe want to take the bull by the horns\u201d.\n\nNajib\u2019s lead counsel, Muhammad Shafee Abdullah, had said last week the prosecution\u2019s case would have collapsed if the evidence of one of the signatories and then SRC directors, Suboh Md Yassin, was rejected by the High Court as he had made contradictory statements.\n\nSuboh had said he had at first told Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) investigators who met him in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates on Nov 17, 2015, that the 13 signatures in the electronic fund transfer instructions to the bank were genuine.\n\nHowever, he said while being cross-examined by Shafee, he told MACC officers in Putrajaya on May 28 and 30, 2018 that his signatures could have been forged.\n\nSuboh also said he once again told MACC officers on Aug 13 and 15, 2018 that the signatures were genuine.\n\nThe defence had suggested that former SRC chief executive officer Nik Faisal Ariff Kamil could have \u201cphotoshopped\u201d (digitally manipulated) Suboh\u2019s signature in the scanned copies before sending them to the bank to carry out the instructions to transfer funds.\n\nShafee had also suggested that Nik Faisal, who has gone missing, had forged and misused Suboh\u2019s signature and put it in the hard copies.\n\nNik Faisal and Suboh were the signatories of the SRC account from which money was transferred to Gandingan Mentari, a subsidiary of SRC.\n\nThey were also signatories of the Gandingan Mentari account, where money was transferred to Ihsan Perdana, a company selected to carry out corporate social responsibility programmes for SRC.\n\nThe prosecution contends that RM42 million from Ihsan Perdana was transferred to Najib\u2019s three Ambank accounts at the Jalan Raja Chulan branch through a \u201clayering process\u201d to conceal its origin.\n\nTrial judge Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali sentenced Najib in July last year to 12 years\u2019 jail and ordered him to pay a RM210 million fine after finding him guilty on the seven counts of abuse of power, criminal breach of trust and money laundering in relation to the RM42 million belonging to SRC.\n\nHe is appealing against his conviction and

optimisation, among others\n\nBy NUR HANANI AZMAN\n\nTHE possible merger between Celcom Axiata Bhd and DiGi.com Bhd would allow the combined entity to better compete in the 5G environment via scale, improved balance sheet and operational execution.\n\nWith 5G services offered via a wholesale arrangement (5G special purpose vehicle), mobile operators no longer need to spend heavily on capital expenditure (capex) but instead focus on price and branding, said RHB Investment Bank Bhd analyst Jeffrey Tan.\n\n\u201cConsolidation would, however, see the number of operators reduced and by extension, result in lesser competition,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve.\n\nOn April 8, Axiata Group Bhd and Telenor Asia Pte Ltd announced that they are in advanced discussions on the potential merger of Celcom and Digi, with the joint entity to be known as Celcom Digi Bhd or MergeCo.\n\nAxiata and Digi will have an equal stake of about 33.1% each in MergeCo, while Axiata together with local institutional funds will own over 51% of MergeCo.\n\nThe merged entity would have a combined 19.1 million customers and total revenue of RM12.4 billion.\n\nWhether this merger fails or succeeds, Jeffrey said it is imperative for mobile operators to consider the longer-term sustainability of the industry and to collaborate in ways to ensure their continued existence in the face of digitalisation.\n\n\u201cThere are lower execution risks with this proposal in that the scope of the merger is significantly smaller and national interests are taken into consideration,\u201d he

to spend RM1.8b in subsidy\n\nby SHAHEERA AZNAM SHAH / pic by RAZAK GHAZALI\n\nTHE Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) is maintaining the monthly quota for subsidised cooking oil through the Cooking Oil Stabilisation Scheme (COSS) at 60,000 tonnes amid the spike in the refined bleached and deodorised (RBD) palm olein price this year.\n\nThe price of vegetable cooking oil has surged 83% to RM4,122 per tonne in 2021 against RM2,255 per tonne recorded last year, said Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi (picture).\n\n\u201cKPDNHEP would like to clarify that the government still maintains the quota for subsidised cooking oil at 60,000 tonnes per month for 2020 and 2021 although the price of RBD palm olein has increased by 83% to RM4,122 per tonne in 2021 compared to RM2,255 per tonne in 2020.\n\n\u201cThis is equivalent to 60 million of 1kg polybag packets, allocated for each Malaysians, including in Sarawak and Sabah, and the government is committed to maintaining the allocation,\u201d he said in a statement yesterday.\n\nNanta Linggi added that should the price of vegetable cooking oil continue to increase, the government is expected to spend RM1.8 billion in subsidy, a hefty increase from RM400 million currently.\n\n\u201cIf the RBD palm olein price continues to show an upward trend, the subsidy cost for the scheme is expected to increase from RM400 million to RM1.8 billion.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the government\u2019s decision to maintain the quotas of the COSS programme indicates the level of commitment in reducing the cost of living and safeguarding the wellbeing of the people.\n\n\u201cThe KPDNHEP Enforcement Division has been conducting comprehensive audits regularly,\u201d he said.\n\nNanta Linggi was responding to a report by the local news portal, Borneo Post Online, claiming that there is a shortage of supply of subsidised cooking oil in the market.\n\nIn addressing the illegality of the distribution of subsidised

Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) has issued 84 notices against food and beverage premises operators nationwide for charging more than RM1 for a glass of plain water.\n\nIts Deputy Minister Datuk Rosol Wahid said all the notices were issued through Ops Catut 8.0 carried out since Wednesday (April 7) following complaints from the public.\n\n\u201cThe operation will be carried out until April 15 by enforcement teams nationwide. Based on the number of notices issued, we find that this is quite a common occurrence.\n\n\u201cThis should not happen... maybe a more appropriate price would be between RM0.20 or RM0.30,\u201c he told reporters after officiating the Terengganu state-level Franchise Bay Tour Programme here today.\n\nOf the 84 notices, Kelantan recorded the highest number with 14, followed by Selangor (12), Sabah (eight), Sarawak (eight), Johor (eight), Pahang (seven), Terengganu (six), Kuala Lumpur (five), Melaka (four), Federal Territory of Labuan (three), Penang (three), Perlis (two), Perak (two) and Negeri Sembilan (two).\n\nTraders who are issued with the notice will be given two to five working days to provide the information required by KPDNHEP before further action is taken in accordance with the Price Control and Anti -Profiteering Act 2011.\n\nMeanwhile, Rosol called on more franchisors to take advantage of the Micro and Affordable Franchise Development Programme to help create better opportunities for entrepreneurs, especially those in the B40 and M40 target groups.\n\nHe said there were currently 1,091 franchise brands registered in Malaysia, of which 694 were local franchise brands.\n\n\u201cHowever, so far only 12 franchise brands have offered micro franchises and affordable franchises. The number is still too small compared to the 1,091 registered franchise brands,\u201d he said.\n\nAffordable franchises are business packages worth RM100 thousand and below, while micro franchises are worth RM50 thousand and below.\n\nRosol said KPDNHEP had allocated a total of RM5 million for the Affordable and Micro Franchise Development Programme, comprising full grants worth RM2 million offered to franchisors, and matching grants totalling RM2.5 million for those from the B40 and M40 groups looking to open a franchise.\n\nOn an unrelated matter, Rosol, who is also Hulu Terengganu MP, said KPDNHEP was monitoring motorcycle sales activities around the Klang Valley, where customers were apparently finding it difficult to purchase new two-wheelers in cash.\n\n\u201cRecently I have received complaints from customers who say they find it difficult to buy motorcycles in cash, because sellers prefer customers to purchase them in installments.\n\n\u201cIf there are reports that traders are pressuring customers, KPDNHEP can investigate. There may be offences (committed) that we can take action against, especially if traders set different prices for the purchase of motorcycles in cash or monthly installments,\u201c he said.\n\nHe added that apart from keeping the people away from the burden of debt, he also did not want them to be saddled with interest payments.\n\n\u201cI think there may be an alliance between the motor companies and finance institutions... imagine if there is a charge of 5% or 8% in interest over five years, how much will they earn (compared to the cash deal) ... if there are two different prices according to the method of purchase, this is wrong,\u201c he said. \u2014 Bernama", "keyword": ["water", "issued", "priced", "84", "franchise", "terengganu", "micro", "nationwide", "glass", "plain", "notices", "kpdnhep", "franchises", "purchase", "issues", "customers", "rm1", "worth"], "summary": "KUALA TERENGGANU: The Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) has issued 84 notices against food and beverage premises operators nationwide for charging more than RM1 for a glass of plain water.\nBased on the number of notices issued, we find that this is quite a common occurrence.\n\u201cHowever, so far only 12 franchise brands have offered micro franchises and affordable franchises.\nAffordable franchises are business packages worth RM100 thousand and below, while micro franchises are worth RM50 thousand and below.\n\u201cIf there are reports that traders are pressuring customers, KPDNHEP can investigate.", "news": "The Sun Daily", "date": "2021-04-10 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Kelantan KPDNHEP seizes 800kg of flour sold without licence", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEPdxU7tI-7bms0z3UhdRH6kqGQgEKhAIACoHCAow9sveCjC0m9YBMPDtoQM?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/kpdnKel925_NSTfield_image_socialmedia.var_1618148048.jpg", "text": "", "keyword": ["flour", "licence", "seizes", "kpdnhep", "kelantan", "800kg", "sold"], "summary": "", "news": "New Straits Times", "date": "2021-04-11 00:00:00", "language": "INDONESIA"}, {"title": "Need Refund From Online Sellers Or Chicken Prices Too High?

the state to monitor and inspect various locations such as public markets, farmers\u2019 markets and supermarkets to ensure the supply and prices of essential goods, including chickens, are stable and adequate for the Ramadan month and Hari Raya Aidilfitri.\n\nIt further said according to the National Price Council Division (BHBN)of KPDNHEP Sarawak, the selling price of standard clean chicken from January to this month is between RM7.90 and RM8.80 per kg.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the price is at normal levels and does not show any unusual increase,\u201d it pointed out in a statement

maintaining a subsidised cooking oil quota of 60,000 tonnes per month despite the increase in the price of refined, bleached and deodorised (RBD) palm oil, says Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi (picture).\n\nThis is equivalent to 60 million one-kilogramme (kg) polybag packets, with 1.5 kg allocated for every Malaysian, including in Sabah and Sarawak.\n\nNanta said RBD palm oil increased by about 83 per cent to RM4,122 per tonne this year compared to RM2,255 per tonne in 2020.\n\n\u201cThe government has also increased the allocation based on a commitment to supply 60,000 tonnes although the price of RBD palm olein has gone up,\u201d he said, adding that the government expected the cost of the subsidy scheme to increase from RM400 million to RM1.8 billion if the price of RBD palm olein continued to rise.\n\n\u201cAs such, the government\u2019s decision to maintain the quota in the Cooking Oil Stabilisation Scheme (COSS) shows the government\u2019s high commitment to reduce the cost of living and ensure the well-being of the people,\u201d he said in a statement today.\n\nThe statement was issued following news reports on alleged shortage of subsidised cooking oil in Sarawak which stemmed from the dishonest action of cooking oil packaging companies of not supplying subsidised cooking oil in prescribed quantities for distribution to supermarkets and grocery stores.\n\nThe report also suggested that KPDNHEP step up monitoring and enforcement on subsidised cooking oil packaging activities and ensure that the RM400 million cooking oil subsidy allocation this year is spent prudently.\n\nNanta said KPDNHEP\u2019s enforcement division always conducted comprehensive audits to ensure that every subsidised cooking oil production was acceptable in each of its distribution chains.\n\nFollowing the audit and stern action in tackling the leakage of subsidised cooking oil distribution, Nanta said a total of 318 cases had been recorded nationwide from 2016 to March 2021.\n\nDuring the same period, four cooking oil packaging companies were taken to task by cancelling the quotas given to them earlier, he said.\n\nOn complaints related to cooking oil in Sarawak, Nanta said a review of records found that there had been 25 complaints since 2020 until March 31 (2021) and 4,221 inspections conducted on premises selling cooking oil until yesterday (April 12).\n\nOn the sugar issue which was also touched on in the news report, Nanta said in principle, the selling price of domestic sugar was controlled at a maximum price of RM2.85 per kg for coarse refined white sugar and RM2.95 per kg for refined white sugar for retail sale.\n\nThe wholesale selling price of sugar for use in the food and beverage (F&B) industry is set at RM2.77 per kg for coarse refined white sugar and RM2.85 per kg for refined white sugar.\n\n\u201cThe difference in lower sugar prices can be enjoyed by F&B companies based on the quantity and method of purchase agreed upon with the supplier, and also depending on the price of raw sugar in the world market without government intervention,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the news report, the F&B industry now has to spend more to get refined sugar at RM2.75 per kg.\n\nNanta said local F&B companies and wholesalers could apply for permits to import refined sugar at any time of the year.\n\n\u201cEligible applications will be carefully considered by an evaluation committee represented by several relevant government agencies including the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, the Malaysian Investment Development Authority and the Royal Malaysian Customs Department, he said.\n\n\u201cThe priority of issuing import permits is to any F&B manufacturing company and wholesaler that meets the evaluation criteria set,\u201d he added.\n\nNanta said continuous monitoring would be carried out on the recipients of permits to import refined sugar to prevent misuse and misappropriation, and enforcement action would be taken against those who misused the permits to import refined sugar.", "keyword": ["sugar", "oil", "month", "fb", "white", "subsidised", "remains",

yesterday claimed that there is a shortage of subsidised 1kg pack of cooking oil due to under-production by some repackers who have been receiving government subsidies.\n\nThe former deputy minister of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) said the government had allocated RM400 million for the cooking oil price stabilisation scheme this year alone to enable the needy across Malaysia to buy the subsidised cooking oil at RM2.50.\n\n\u201cEvery year, there is government allocation to maintain the price of the 1kg subsidised cooking oil at RM2.50. The allocation for this year is RM400 million and it was also RM400 million last year.\n\n\u201cWhen PH (Pakatan Harapan) was the government, the allocation was RM720 million in 2018 and RM600 million in 2019. During our time, we made sure all this amount go to packing the subsidised cooking oil. But lately I noticed that there is a huge shortage of this 1kg cooking oil,\u201d he said during his Facebook live in e-Mart Batu Kawa here.\n\nChong, who is Stampin MP and Kota Sentosa assemblyman, claimed that some repackers had resorted to over-claiming of subsidies or under-production of subsidised cooking oil.\n\nFor instance, he said a repacker who was supposed to pack 1,500kg of cooking oil only packed 1,000kg but still claimed the subsidy amount for 1,500kg.\n\n\u201cDuring PH\u2019s time, it\u2019s very seldom that you didn\u2019t get the 1kg cooking oil in the market. But after PH is no longer the government, most of the time you can\u2019t get this 1kg cooking oil.\n\n\u201cWhy? I believe the hanky panky thing has found its way back to the system. That\u2019s why we are having this Facebook live to forewarn the government,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also called upon his former colleagues at KPDNHEP to carry out strict enforcement to ensure a stable supply of the subsidised cooking oil.\n\nWhen he was the deputy KPDNHEP minister, Chong said they kept a record of the volume repackers delivered to the retailers, who must then have a record for the ministry to cross check.\n\nWith such strict enforcement, he said the government would be able to make sure that the allocation could benefit the target groups.\n\n\u201cI think the situation is quite bad now, a lot of time you can\u2019t find the 1kg cooking oil. After all, it\u2019s RM400 million of government allocation we are talking about.\u201d\n\nChong said the previous PH government managed to bring down the price of sugar to RM1.70 or RM1.80 per kg for food and beverages (F&B) manufacturers but today, they had to fork out RM2.75 per kg.\n\nHe added that the former federal government opened up sugar import for F&B manufacturers in Sarawak.\n\nHe was glad that the current federal government had carried on the policy but some F&B manufacturers in the state had complained that their applications for sugar import had been rejected by Putrajaya.\n\n\u201c(KPDNHEP Minister Datuk) Alexandar Nanta Linggi is a Sarawakian. He can do much better than what I did as a deputy minister since he is a full minister.\n\n\u201cI will talk to Alexandar Nanta and ask him to make it easier for F&B manufacturers in Sarawak to apply for the sugar import permit,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier, Chong handed out shopping vouchers worth RM100 to about 40 needy individuals under a social programme in collaboration with e-Mart Batu Kawa to

introduced 20 initiatives since 2020 to help companies and entrepreneurs reduce the impact of Covid-19 in their businesses.\n\nOf these initiatives, three of them were also announced in the Pemerkasa agenda.\n\nSSM\u2019s first initiative in Pemerkasa was to increase the current threshold value of indebtedness under Section 466 of the Companies Act 2016 from RM10,000 to RM50,000 until Dec 31, 2020, along with the period to respond to a notice of claim by a company was also extended to six months.\n\n\u201cTaking into account the uncertainties in the global and domestic economic conditions following the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, SSM has also announced that the company\u2019s indebtedness threshold was raised to RM50,000 effective April 1, 2021, as a new permanent threshold value,\u201d said Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi in his speech during SSM\u2019s 19th Anniversary Ceremony in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.\n\nThe second initiative offers free business registration facilities to B40 group entrepreneurs and full -time IPT students who wish to venture into entrepreneurship while the third initiative was offering assistance to the disabled to register and renew their business with SSM for free.\n\nHe added SSM remains committed to helping ease the burden of the business community by implementing initiatives to extend the compound exemption for delays in renewing business registrations and delays in registering new businesses under the Business Registration Act 1956 until Dec 31 this year which will benefit over 330,000 business communities.\n\nThe minister announced this initiative on March 30, as an extension of the implementation of the compound exemption for delays in renewing business registration certificates implemented from March 17 \u2013 Dec 31, 2020, before being extended until June 30 this year.\n\nIn the same event he said SSM has spent a total of RM3.6 million in corporate zakat allocation and RM242,500 in corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives in 2020.\n\n\u201cI hope that SSM will be more successful in the future and be able to continue this noble endeavour,\u201d he added.\n\nSSM also launched the \u2018Usahawan Bijak, Usahawan Berdaftar\u2019 campaign that aims to produce ethical and trusted entrepreneurs and will be implemented throughout 2021.\n\nThe campaign is one of the methods to encourage the public, especially traders to register businesses.\n\nAll businesses need to register with SSM either under the Business Registration Act 1956 which applies in Peninsular Malaysia and the Federal Territory of Labuan or under the Companies Act 2016 and the Limited Liability Partnership Act 2012.\n\nThrough this campaign, SSM calls on all

I have very little information on her and her family as my mother would not want to share much on her sister who was \u2018given away\u2019 or maybe she really didn\u2019t know much about them as she was from another mother,\u201d Sim explained.\n\n\u201cThen 21 years ago we managed to meet up for the first time. Then Toh Puan Sri had just married Tun Pehin Sri Salahuddin. Suddenly our family size grew following the meeting for the first time between Toh Puan Sri and my mum, since their birth.\u201d\n\nAlthough Norkiah was given up for adoption to a Malay family back in the early 50s, when the situations in those days were tough with some households having more than 10 children, it was not unusual for families to give away their children (particularly girls) to young couples who were not able to conceive their own, he said.\n\n\u201cA few months after the family meeting, Tun Pehin Sri Salahuddin was appointed as the Governor of Sarawak again (for the second time) and my late auntie\u2019s life took a huge change. Her role changed drastically from a loving wife to Tun, but was elevated to First Lady of Sarawak.\n\n\u201cThe late Toh Puan Sri was fortunate because her life story would become one that is reminiscent of the Cinderella story when she met, fell in love and married Tun Pehin Sri. She was Tun Pehin Sri\u2019s second wife after his first wife had passed away,\u201d Sim added.\n\n\u201cShe was born into a poor Chinese family and given away to an equally poor Malay family and like Cinderella she ended up happy ever after in the Astana of Sarawak as the First Lady of Sarawak.\n\n\u201cShe made sure that her years as First Lady were not wasted. She started her charity works, helped and touched so many lives like the orphans, elderly and the poor. She was generous, approachable, down to earth and putting others first.\u201d\n\nSince then, she had dedicated her life to the wellbeing of others, playing her role as the mother to all Sarawakians regardless of race or creed, Sim added.\n\n(For the freshest news, join our Telegram channel)\n\n\u201cIndeed Toh Puan\u2019s life is part and parcel of Sarawak\u2019s story. Hers is similar to that of Datin Amar Dato Hajjah Juma\u2019ani Tuanku Haji Bujang, wife of the Chief Minister (Datuk Patinggi Abang Johari Tun Openg), who was also adopted by a Muslim family from a Chinese family.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy aunty and Tun Pehin Sri had brought much peace, harmony and unity of all Sarawakians. They would be joining my activities by lending their support especially during Inter-cultural Mooncake festival. They would not miss any of the annual celebrations held at Carpenter Street. They would grace dinner functions hosted by many associations that me and my late father Datuk Sim Swee Yong were involved in. Their show of love for all Sarawakians irrespective of race and religion is what makes us and Sarawakians unique and special,\u201d added Sim.\n\n\u201cShe was a shining example of our unity in diversity. Her upbringing in a Muslim and Malay family is very typical of our Sarawakian lifestyle in the early 50s and 60s when children were given for adoption due to poverty. This priceless practice is the saving grace of our bond and unity of all races in Sarawak.

Instead, let the interministerial discussion happen, then formulate a pricing index and monitor it.\n\n\u201cMake a one-year action plan, not only for festive season. Run it for a year, check every month (whether it is) working or not. If something is wrong, solve it,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve (TMR).\n\nGeorge, with 45 years of experience addressing public interest issues, said the government is not engaging consumer groups to handle the problem.\n\nHe said price hike will change consumers\u2019 purchasing patterns which activate the panic buying mode where people buy more and impact the distribution chain.\n\n\u201cThe government needs to set a competent task force with intelligent members to sit with policymakers, so they can advise the ministers after being on the ground on a plan of action that can be rolled out to address the issue.\n\n\u201cTo come out with realistic costs, we have to make sure people on the ground or people in the marketplace are not profiteering,\u201d he added.\n\nGeorge said he was part of a task force which was set up before the last election, but the committee didn\u2019t get off the ground with the change in government.\n\nMeanwhile, Federation of Malaysian Consumers Associations (Fomca) CEO Datuk Dr Paul Selvaraj said increases in prices are not just an immediate problem, but caused by investment in agriculture and supply chain competitiveness.\n\nHe said a lot of production is still dependent on imports and when the prices go up in the international market, the country gets affected.\n\n\u201cFomca always advocates moving forward self-sufficiency so that we are not impacted by world trade or problems from other markets.\n\n\u201cWe neglect the agriculture sector and do not beat up the demand of our modern economy. We still import beef, fish and vegetables,\u201d he told TMR.\n\nHe said Malaysia needs to shift focus to agriculture production by maintaining a vibrant industry, not only for production purposes, but also to attract new generations.\n\n\u201cTo make it attractive, it must be viable and (can) provide a good income. In other countries, developing sustainable agriculture is a major stake. Why can\u2019t we do that?\u201d he added.\n\nHe also said the Malaysia Competition Commission did a market surveillance on food and they found that along the supply chain, there is a lot of market manipulation that gets people together and manipulates prices.\n\nWhile conducting the survey, \u201cthey also identified a long supply chain where the market manipulation is going on. Monopolistic behaviour makes consumers suffer\u201d.\n\n\u201cSince the information is there and a survey has been done, the government should take action towards these people who take advantage of profit gearing. It should be a continuing enforcement,\u201d he said.\n\nMalaysian Muslim Consumers Association lead activist Datuk Nadzim Johan said the government does not really play their role to address the increasing prices of essential items.\n\n\u201cIt is a big challenge, but we have an option actually. But we chose the wrong way. Why do we have to buy chillies from Thailand at RM26 per kg?\n\n\u201cOur agriculture is still lagging. Why don\u2019t we plant those vegetables ourselves?\u201d he told TMR.\n\nNadzim said the current state of Emergency needs to end immediately to tackle this issue which can lead to serious problems, such as unemployment, suicide and high debt.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the Emergency is necessary in the first place.

Najib has no privity of contract with the bank,\u201d he said.\n\nSithambaram, who was given a special licence by the attorney-general to prosecute Najib\u2019s SRC International corruption case, said \u201cthe defence has to respond to the prosecution\u2019s case on the seven charges\u201d faced by the former prime minister.\n\n\u201cThe issue of forged or unauthorised scan (of signatures) and electronic transfer is a non-starter, especially for the criminal breach of trust charges.\n\n\u201cThe issue raised is a red herring by the defence, and who would have the audacity to fix a then sitting prime minister?\u201d he asked.\n\nHe said SRC did not sue the bank for negligence or asked the financial institution to pay back the money.\n\n\u201cNo company will keep quiet if there is no proper authorisation and withdrawal of money.\u201d\n\nSithambaram said there was evidence that the SRC directors had authorised the bank to conduct electronic transfers and the bank said it had also acted based on the mandate of SRC signatories.\n\nIn fact, he said, Najib had not returned the RM42 million although he had admitted receiving the money that belonged to SRC.\n\n\u201cHe only said (he did not have) knowledge of how the money came in but we have proven the RM42 million went into his accounts,\u201d he said, adding that the prosecution was raising this issue as \u201cwe want to take the bull by the horns\u201d.\n\nNajib\u2019s lead counsel, Muhammad Shafee Abdullah, had said last week the prosecution\u2019s case would have collapsed if the evidence of one of the signatories and then SRC directors, Suboh Md Yassin, was rejected by the High Court as he had made contradictory statements.\n\nSuboh had said he had at first told Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) investigators who met him in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates on Nov 17, 2015, that the 13 signatures in the electronic fund transfer instructions to the bank were genuine.\n\nHowever, he said while being cross-examined by Shafee, he told MACC officers in Putrajaya on May 28 and 30, 2018 that his signatures could have been forged.\n\nSuboh also said he once again told MACC officers on Aug 13 and 15, 2018 that the signatures were genuine.\n\nThe defence had suggested that former SRC chief executive officer Nik Faisal Ariff Kamil could have \u201cphotoshopped\u201d (digitally manipulated) Suboh\u2019s signature in the scanned copies before sending them to the bank to carry out the instructions to transfer funds.\n\nShafee had also suggested that Nik Faisal, who has gone missing, had forged and misused Suboh\u2019s signature and put it in the hard copies.\n\nNik Faisal and Suboh were the signatories of the SRC account from which money was transferred to Gandingan Mentari, a subsidiary of SRC.\n\nThey were also signatories of the Gandingan Mentari account, where money was transferred to Ihsan Perdana, a company selected to carry out corporate social responsibility programmes for SRC.\n\nThe prosecution contends that RM42 million from Ihsan Perdana was transferred to Najib\u2019s three Ambank accounts at the Jalan Raja Chulan branch through a \u201clayering process\u201d to conceal its origin.\n\nTrial judge Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali sentenced Najib in July last year to 12 years\u2019 jail and ordered him to pay a RM210 million fine after finding him guilty on the seven counts of abuse of power, criminal breach of trust and money laundering in relation to the RM42 million belonging to SRC.\n\nHe is appealing against his conviction and

optimisation, among others\n\nBy NUR HANANI AZMAN\n\nTHE possible merger between Celcom Axiata Bhd and DiGi.com Bhd would allow the combined entity to better compete in the 5G environment via scale, improved balance sheet and operational execution.\n\nWith 5G services offered via a wholesale arrangement (5G special purpose vehicle), mobile operators no longer need to spend heavily on capital expenditure (capex) but instead focus on price and branding, said RHB Investment Bank Bhd analyst Jeffrey Tan.\n\n\u201cConsolidation would, however, see the number of operators reduced and by extension, result in lesser competition,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve.\n\nOn April 8, Axiata Group Bhd and Telenor Asia Pte Ltd announced that they are in advanced discussions on the potential merger of Celcom and Digi, with the joint entity to be known as Celcom Digi Bhd or MergeCo.\n\nAxiata and Digi will have an equal stake of about 33.1% each in MergeCo, while Axiata together with local institutional funds will own over 51% of MergeCo.\n\nThe merged entity would have a combined 19.1 million customers and total revenue of RM12.4 billion.\n\nWhether this merger fails or succeeds, Jeffrey said it is imperative for mobile operators to consider the longer-term sustainability of the industry and to collaborate in ways to ensure their continued existence in the face of digitalisation.\n\n\u201cThere are lower execution risks with this proposal in that the scope of the merger is significantly smaller and national interests are taken into consideration,\u201d he

to spend RM1.8b in subsidy\n\nby SHAHEERA AZNAM SHAH / pic by RAZAK GHAZALI\n\nTHE Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) is maintaining the monthly quota for subsidised cooking oil through the Cooking Oil Stabilisation Scheme (COSS) at 60,000 tonnes amid the spike in the refined bleached and deodorised (RBD) palm olein price this year.\n\nThe price of vegetable cooking oil has surged 83% to RM4,122 per tonne in 2021 against RM2,255 per tonne recorded last year, said Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi (picture).\n\n\u201cKPDNHEP would like to clarify that the government still maintains the quota for subsidised cooking oil at 60,000 tonnes per month for 2020 and 2021 although the price of RBD palm olein has increased by 83% to RM4,122 per tonne in 2021 compared to RM2,255 per tonne in 2020.\n\n\u201cThis is equivalent to 60 million of 1kg polybag packets, allocated for each Malaysians, including in Sarawak and Sabah, and the government is committed to maintaining the allocation,\u201d he said in a statement yesterday.\n\nNanta Linggi added that should the price of vegetable cooking oil continue to increase, the government is expected to spend RM1.8 billion in subsidy, a hefty increase from RM400 million currently.\n\n\u201cIf the RBD palm olein price continues to show an upward trend, the subsidy cost for the scheme is expected to increase from RM400 million to RM1.8 billion.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the government\u2019s decision to maintain the quotas of the COSS programme indicates the level of commitment in reducing the cost of living and safeguarding the wellbeing of the people.\n\n\u201cThe KPDNHEP Enforcement Division has been conducting comprehensive audits regularly,\u201d he said.\n\nNanta Linggi was responding to a report by the local news portal, Borneo Post Online, claiming that there is a shortage of supply of subsidised cooking oil in the market.\n\nIn addressing the illegality of the distribution of subsidised

Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) has issued 84 notices against food and beverage premises operators nationwide for charging more than RM1 for a glass of plain water.\n\nIts Deputy Minister Datuk Rosol Wahid said all the notices were issued through Ops Catut 8.0 carried out since Wednesday (April 7) following complaints from the public.\n\n\u201cThe operation will be carried out until April 15 by enforcement teams nationwide. Based on the number of notices issued, we find that this is quite a common occurrence.\n\n\u201cThis should not happen... maybe a more appropriate price would be between RM0.20 or RM0.30,\u201c he told reporters after officiating the Terengganu state-level Franchise Bay Tour Programme here today.\n\nOf the 84 notices, Kelantan recorded the highest number with 14, followed by Selangor (12), Sabah (eight), Sarawak (eight), Johor (eight), Pahang (seven), Terengganu (six), Kuala Lumpur (five), Melaka (four), Federal Territory of Labuan (three), Penang (three), Perlis (two), Perak (two) and Negeri Sembilan (two).\n\nTraders who are issued with the notice will be given two to five working days to provide the information required by KPDNHEP before further action is taken in accordance with the Price Control and Anti -Profiteering Act 2011.\n\nMeanwhile, Rosol called on more franchisors to take advantage of the Micro and Affordable Franchise Development Programme to help create better opportunities for entrepreneurs, especially those in the B40 and M40 target groups.\n\nHe said there were currently 1,091 franchise brands registered in Malaysia, of which 694 were local franchise brands.\n\n\u201cHowever, so far only 12 franchise brands have offered micro franchises and affordable franchises. The number is still too small compared to the 1,091 registered franchise brands,\u201d he said.\n\nAffordable franchises are business packages worth RM100 thousand and below, while micro franchises are worth RM50 thousand and below.\n\nRosol said KPDNHEP had allocated a total of RM5 million for the Affordable and Micro Franchise Development Programme, comprising full grants worth RM2 million offered to franchisors, and matching grants totalling RM2.5 million for those from the B40 and M40 groups looking to open a franchise.\n\nOn an unrelated matter, Rosol, who is also Hulu Terengganu MP, said KPDNHEP was monitoring motorcycle sales activities around the Klang Valley, where customers were apparently finding it difficult to purchase new two-wheelers in cash.\n\n\u201cRecently I have received complaints from customers who say they find it difficult to buy motorcycles in cash, because sellers prefer customers to purchase them in installments.\n\n\u201cIf there are reports that traders are pressuring customers, KPDNHEP can investigate. There may be offences (committed) that we can take action against, especially if traders set different prices for the purchase of motorcycles in cash or monthly installments,\u201c he said.\n\nHe added that apart from keeping the people away from the burden of debt, he also did not want them to be saddled with interest payments.\n\n\u201cI think there may be an alliance between the motor companies and finance institutions... imagine if there is a charge of 5% or 8% in interest over five years, how much will they earn (compared to the cash deal) ... if there are two different prices according to the method of purchase, this is wrong,\u201c he said. \u2014 Bernama", "keyword": ["water", "issued", "priced", "84", "franchise", "terengganu", "micro", "nationwide", "glass", "plain", "notices", "kpdnhep", "franchises", "purchase", "issues", "customers", "rm1", "worth"], "summary": "KUALA TERENGGANU: The Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) has issued 84 notices against food and beverage premises operators nationwide for charging more than RM1 for a glass of plain water.\nBased on the number of notices issued, we find that this is quite a common occurrence.\n\u201cHowever, so far only 12 franchise brands have offered micro franchises and affordable franchises.\nAffordable franchises are business packages worth RM100 thousand and below, while micro franchises are worth RM50 thousand and below.\n\u201cIf there are reports that traders are pressuring customers, KPDNHEP can investigate.", "news": "The Sun Daily", "date": "2021-04-10 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Kelantan KPDNHEP seizes 800kg of flour sold without licence", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEPdxU7tI-7bms0z3UhdRH6kqGQgEKhAIACoHCAow9sveCjC0m9YBMPDtoQM?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/kpdnKel925_NSTfield_image_socialmedia.var_1618148048.jpg", "text": "", "keyword": ["flour", "licence", "seizes", "kpdnhep", "kelantan", "800kg", "sold"], "summary": "", "news": "New Straits Times", "date": "2021-04-11 00:00:00", "language": "INDONESIA"}, {"title": "Need Refund From Online Sellers Or Chicken Prices Too High?

the state to monitor and inspect various locations such as public markets, farmers\u2019 markets and supermarkets to ensure the supply and prices of essential goods, including chickens, are stable and adequate for the Ramadan month and Hari Raya Aidilfitri.\n\nIt further said according to the National Price Council Division (BHBN)of KPDNHEP Sarawak, the selling price of standard clean chicken from January to this month is between RM7.90 and RM8.80 per kg.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the price is at normal levels and does not show any unusual increase,\u201d it pointed out in a statement

maintaining a subsidised cooking oil quota of 60,000 tonnes per month despite the increase in the price of refined, bleached and deodorised (RBD) palm oil, says Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi (picture).\n\nThis is equivalent to 60 million one-kilogramme (kg) polybag packets, with 1.5 kg allocated for every Malaysian, including in Sabah and Sarawak.\n\nNanta said RBD palm oil increased by about 83 per cent to RM4,122 per tonne this year compared to RM2,255 per tonne in 2020.\n\n\u201cThe government has also increased the allocation based on a commitment to supply 60,000 tonnes although the price of RBD palm olein has gone up,\u201d he said, adding that the government expected the cost of the subsidy scheme to increase from RM400 million to RM1.8 billion if the price of RBD palm olein continued to rise.\n\n\u201cAs such, the government\u2019s decision to maintain the quota in the Cooking Oil Stabilisation Scheme (COSS) shows the government\u2019s high commitment to reduce the cost of living and ensure the well-being of the people,\u201d he said in a statement today.\n\nThe statement was issued following news reports on alleged shortage of subsidised cooking oil in Sarawak which stemmed from the dishonest action of cooking oil packaging companies of not supplying subsidised cooking oil in prescribed quantities for distribution to supermarkets and grocery stores.\n\nThe report also suggested that KPDNHEP step up monitoring and enforcement on subsidised cooking oil packaging activities and ensure that the RM400 million cooking oil subsidy allocation this year is spent prudently.\n\nNanta said KPDNHEP\u2019s enforcement division always conducted comprehensive audits to ensure that every subsidised cooking oil production was acceptable in each of its distribution chains.\n\nFollowing the audit and stern action in tackling the leakage of subsidised cooking oil distribution, Nanta said a total of 318 cases had been recorded nationwide from 2016 to March 2021.\n\nDuring the same period, four cooking oil packaging companies were taken to task by cancelling the quotas given to them earlier, he said.\n\nOn complaints related to cooking oil in Sarawak, Nanta said a review of records found that there had been 25 complaints since 2020 until March 31 (2021) and 4,221 inspections conducted on premises selling cooking oil until yesterday (April 12).\n\nOn the sugar issue which was also touched on in the news report, Nanta said in principle, the selling price of domestic sugar was controlled at a maximum price of RM2.85 per kg for coarse refined white sugar and RM2.95 per kg for refined white sugar for retail sale.\n\nThe wholesale selling price of sugar for use in the food and beverage (F&B) industry is set at RM2.77 per kg for coarse refined white sugar and RM2.85 per kg for refined white sugar.\n\n\u201cThe difference in lower sugar prices can be enjoyed by F&B companies based on the quantity and method of purchase agreed upon with the supplier, and also depending on the price of raw sugar in the world market without government intervention,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the news report, the F&B industry now has to spend more to get refined sugar at RM2.75 per kg.\n\nNanta said local F&B companies and wholesalers could apply for permits to import refined sugar at any time of the year.\n\n\u201cEligible applications will be carefully considered by an evaluation committee represented by several relevant government agencies including the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, the Malaysian Investment Development Authority and the Royal Malaysian Customs Department, he said.\n\n\u201cThe priority of issuing import permits is to any F&B manufacturing company and wholesaler that meets the evaluation criteria set,\u201d he added.\n\nNanta said continuous monitoring would be carried out on the recipients of permits to import refined sugar to prevent misuse and misappropriation, and enforcement action would be taken against those who misused the permits to import refined sugar.", "keyword": ["sugar", "oil", "month", "fb", "white", "subsidised", "remains",

yesterday claimed that there is a shortage of subsidised 1kg pack of cooking oil due to under-production by some repackers who have been receiving government subsidies.\n\nThe former deputy minister of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) said the government had allocated RM400 million for the cooking oil price stabilisation scheme this year alone to enable the needy across Malaysia to buy the subsidised cooking oil at RM2.50.\n\n\u201cEvery year, there is government allocation to maintain the price of the 1kg subsidised cooking oil at RM2.50. The allocation for this year is RM400 million and it was also RM400 million last year.\n\n\u201cWhen PH (Pakatan Harapan) was the government, the allocation was RM720 million in 2018 and RM600 million in 2019. During our time, we made sure all this amount go to packing the subsidised cooking oil. But lately I noticed that there is a huge shortage of this 1kg cooking oil,\u201d he said during his Facebook live in e-Mart Batu Kawa here.\n\nChong, who is Stampin MP and Kota Sentosa assemblyman, claimed that some repackers had resorted to over-claiming of subsidies or under-production of subsidised cooking oil.\n\nFor instance, he said a repacker who was supposed to pack 1,500kg of cooking oil only packed 1,000kg but still claimed the subsidy amount for 1,500kg.\n\n\u201cDuring PH\u2019s time, it\u2019s very seldom that you didn\u2019t get the 1kg cooking oil in the market. But after PH is no longer the government, most of the time you can\u2019t get this 1kg cooking oil.\n\n\u201cWhy? I believe the hanky panky thing has found its way back to the system. That\u2019s why we are having this Facebook live to forewarn the government,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also called upon his former colleagues at KPDNHEP to carry out strict enforcement to ensure a stable supply of the subsidised cooking oil.\n\nWhen he was the deputy KPDNHEP minister, Chong said they kept a record of the volume repackers delivered to the retailers, who must then have a record for the ministry to cross check.\n\nWith such strict enforcement, he said the government would be able to make sure that the allocation could benefit the target groups.\n\n\u201cI think the situation is quite bad now, a lot of time you can\u2019t find the 1kg cooking oil. After all, it\u2019s RM400 million of government allocation we are talking about.\u201d\n\nChong said the previous PH government managed to bring down the price of sugar to RM1.70 or RM1.80 per kg for food and beverages (F&B) manufacturers but today, they had to fork out RM2.75 per kg.\n\nHe added that the former federal government opened up sugar import for F&B manufacturers in Sarawak.\n\nHe was glad that the current federal government had carried on the policy but some F&B manufacturers in the state had complained that their applications for sugar import had been rejected by Putrajaya.\n\n\u201c(KPDNHEP Minister Datuk) Alexandar Nanta Linggi is a Sarawakian. He can do much better than what I did as a deputy minister since he is a full minister.\n\n\u201cI will talk to Alexandar Nanta and ask him to make it easier for F&B manufacturers in Sarawak to apply for the sugar import permit,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier, Chong handed out shopping vouchers worth RM100 to about 40 needy individuals under a social programme in collaboration with e-Mart Batu Kawa to

introduced 20 initiatives since 2020 to help companies and entrepreneurs reduce the impact of Covid-19 in their businesses.\n\nOf these initiatives, three of them were also announced in the Pemerkasa agenda.\n\nSSM\u2019s first initiative in Pemerkasa was to increase the current threshold value of indebtedness under Section 466 of the Companies Act 2016 from RM10,000 to RM50,000 until Dec 31, 2020, along with the period to respond to a notice of claim by a company was also extended to six months.\n\n\u201cTaking into account the uncertainties in the global and domestic economic conditions following the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, SSM has also announced that the company\u2019s indebtedness threshold was raised to RM50,000 effective April 1, 2021, as a new permanent threshold value,\u201d said Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi in his speech during SSM\u2019s 19th Anniversary Ceremony in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.\n\nThe second initiative offers free business registration facilities to B40 group entrepreneurs and full -time IPT students who wish to venture into entrepreneurship while the third initiative was offering assistance to the disabled to register and renew their business with SSM for free.\n\nHe added SSM remains committed to helping ease the burden of the business community by implementing initiatives to extend the compound exemption for delays in renewing business registrations and delays in registering new businesses under the Business Registration Act 1956 until Dec 31 this year which will benefit over 330,000 business communities.\n\nThe minister announced this initiative on March 30, as an extension of the implementation of the compound exemption for delays in renewing business registration certificates implemented from March 17 \u2013 Dec 31, 2020, before being extended until June 30 this year.\n\nIn the same event he said SSM has spent a total of RM3.6 million in corporate zakat allocation and RM242,500 in corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives in 2020.\n\n\u201cI hope that SSM will be more successful in the future and be able to continue this noble endeavour,\u201d he added.\n\nSSM also launched the \u2018Usahawan Bijak, Usahawan Berdaftar\u2019 campaign that aims to produce ethical and trusted entrepreneurs and will be implemented throughout 2021.\n\nThe campaign is one of the methods to encourage the public, especially traders to register businesses.\n\nAll businesses need to register with SSM either under the Business Registration Act 1956 which applies in Peninsular Malaysia and the Federal Territory of Labuan or under the Companies Act 2016 and the Limited Liability Partnership Act 2012.\n\nThrough this campaign, SSM calls on all

I have very little information on her and her family as my mother would not want to share much on her sister who was \u2018given away\u2019 or maybe she really didn\u2019t know much about them as she was from another mother,\u201d Sim explained.\n\n\u201cThen 21 years ago we managed to meet up for the first time. Then Toh Puan Sri had just married Tun Pehin Sri Salahuddin. Suddenly our family size grew following the meeting for the first time between Toh Puan Sri and my mum, since their birth.\u201d\n\nAlthough Norkiah was given up for adoption to a Malay family back in the early 50s, when the situations in those days were tough with some households having more than 10 children, it was not unusual for families to give away their children (particularly girls) to young couples who were not able to conceive their own, he said.\n\n\u201cA few months after the family meeting, Tun Pehin Sri Salahuddin was appointed as the Governor of Sarawak again (for the second time) and my late auntie\u2019s life took a huge change. Her role changed drastically from a loving wife to Tun, but was elevated to First Lady of Sarawak.\n\n\u201cThe late Toh Puan Sri was fortunate because her life story would become one that is reminiscent of the Cinderella story when she met, fell in love and married Tun Pehin Sri. She was Tun Pehin Sri\u2019s second wife after his first wife had passed away,\u201d Sim added.\n\n\u201cShe was born into a poor Chinese family and given away to an equally poor Malay family and like Cinderella she ended up happy ever after in the Astana of Sarawak as the First Lady of Sarawak.\n\n\u201cShe made sure that her years as First Lady were not wasted. She started her charity works, helped and touched so many lives like the orphans, elderly and the poor. She was generous, approachable, down to earth and putting others first.\u201d\n\nSince then, she had dedicated her life to the wellbeing of others, playing her role as the mother to all Sarawakians regardless of race or creed, Sim added.\n\n(For the freshest news, join our Telegram channel)\n\n\u201cIndeed Toh Puan\u2019s life is part and parcel of Sarawak\u2019s story. Hers is similar to that of Datin Amar Dato Hajjah Juma\u2019ani Tuanku Haji Bujang, wife of the Chief Minister (Datuk Patinggi Abang Johari Tun Openg), who was also adopted by a Muslim family from a Chinese family.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy aunty and Tun Pehin Sri had brought much peace, harmony and unity of all Sarawakians. They would be joining my activities by lending their support especially during Inter-cultural Mooncake festival. They would not miss any of the annual celebrations held at Carpenter Street. They would grace dinner functions hosted by many associations that me and my late father Datuk Sim Swee Yong were involved in. Their show of love for all Sarawakians irrespective of race and religion is what makes us and Sarawakians unique and special,\u201d added Sim.\n\n\u201cShe was a shining example of our unity in diversity. Her upbringing in a Muslim and Malay family is very typical of our Sarawakian lifestyle in the early 50s and 60s when children were given for adoption due to poverty. This priceless practice is the saving grace of our bond and unity of all races in Sarawak.

Instead, let the interministerial discussion happen, then formulate a pricing index and monitor it.\n\n\u201cMake a one-year action plan, not only for festive season. Run it for a year, check every month (whether it is) working or not. If something is wrong, solve it,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve (TMR).\n\nGeorge, with 45 years of experience addressing public interest issues, said the government is not engaging consumer groups to handle the problem.\n\nHe said price hike will change consumers\u2019 purchasing patterns which activate the panic buying mode where people buy more and impact the distribution chain.\n\n\u201cThe government needs to set a competent task force with intelligent members to sit with policymakers, so they can advise the ministers after being on the ground on a plan of action that can be rolled out to address the issue.\n\n\u201cTo come out with realistic costs, we have to make sure people on the ground or people in the marketplace are not profiteering,\u201d he added.\n\nGeorge said he was part of a task force which was set up before the last election, but the committee didn\u2019t get off the ground with the change in government.\n\nMeanwhile, Federation of Malaysian Consumers Associations (Fomca) CEO Datuk Dr Paul Selvaraj said increases in prices are not just an immediate problem, but caused by investment in agriculture and supply chain competitiveness.\n\nHe said a lot of production is still dependent on imports and when the prices go up in the international market, the country gets affected.\n\n\u201cFomca always advocates moving forward self-sufficiency so that we are not impacted by world trade or problems from other markets.\n\n\u201cWe neglect the agriculture sector and do not beat up the demand of our modern economy. We still import beef, fish and vegetables,\u201d he told TMR.\n\nHe said Malaysia needs to shift focus to agriculture production by maintaining a vibrant industry, not only for production purposes, but also to attract new generations.\n\n\u201cTo make it attractive, it must be viable and (can) provide a good income. In other countries, developing sustainable agriculture is a major stake. Why can\u2019t we do that?\u201d he added.\n\nHe also said the Malaysia Competition Commission did a market surveillance on food and they found that along the supply chain, there is a lot of market manipulation that gets people together and manipulates prices.\n\nWhile conducting the survey, \u201cthey also identified a long supply chain where the market manipulation is going on. Monopolistic behaviour makes consumers suffer\u201d.\n\n\u201cSince the information is there and a survey has been done, the government should take action towards these people who take advantage of profit gearing. It should be a continuing enforcement,\u201d he said.\n\nMalaysian Muslim Consumers Association lead activist Datuk Nadzim Johan said the government does not really play their role to address the increasing prices of essential items.\n\n\u201cIt is a big challenge, but we have an option actually. But we chose the wrong way. Why do we have to buy chillies from Thailand at RM26 per kg?\n\n\u201cOur agriculture is still lagging. Why don\u2019t we plant those vegetables ourselves?\u201d he told TMR.\n\nNadzim said the current state of Emergency needs to end immediately to tackle this issue which can lead to serious problems, such as unemployment, suicide and high debt.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the Emergency is necessary in the first place.

Najib has no privity of contract with the bank,\u201d he said.\n\nSithambaram, who was given a special licence by the attorney-general to prosecute Najib\u2019s SRC International corruption case, said \u201cthe defence has to respond to the prosecution\u2019s case on the seven charges\u201d faced by the former prime minister.\n\n\u201cThe issue of forged or unauthorised scan (of signatures) and electronic transfer is a non-starter, especially for the criminal breach of trust charges.\n\n\u201cThe issue raised is a red herring by the defence, and who would have the audacity to fix a then sitting prime minister?\u201d he asked.\n\nHe said SRC did not sue the bank for negligence or asked the financial institution to pay back the money.\n\n\u201cNo company will keep quiet if there is no proper authorisation and withdrawal of money.\u201d\n\nSithambaram said there was evidence that the SRC directors had authorised the bank to conduct electronic transfers and the bank said it had also acted based on the mandate of SRC signatories.\n\nIn fact, he said, Najib had not returned the RM42 million although he had admitted receiving the money that belonged to SRC.\n\n\u201cHe only said (he did not have) knowledge of how the money came in but we have proven the RM42 million went into his accounts,\u201d he said, adding that the prosecution was raising this issue as \u201cwe want to take the bull by the horns\u201d.\n\nNajib\u2019s lead counsel, Muhammad Shafee Abdullah, had said last week the prosecution\u2019s case would have collapsed if the evidence of one of the signatories and then SRC directors, Suboh Md Yassin, was rejected by the High Court as he had made contradictory statements.\n\nSuboh had said he had at first told Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) investigators who met him in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates on Nov 17, 2015, that the 13 signatures in the electronic fund transfer instructions to the bank were genuine.\n\nHowever, he said while being cross-examined by Shafee, he told MACC officers in Putrajaya on May 28 and 30, 2018 that his signatures could have been forged.\n\nSuboh also said he once again told MACC officers on Aug 13 and 15, 2018 that the signatures were genuine.\n\nThe defence had suggested that former SRC chief executive officer Nik Faisal Ariff Kamil could have \u201cphotoshopped\u201d (digitally manipulated) Suboh\u2019s signature in the scanned copies before sending them to the bank to carry out the instructions to transfer funds.\n\nShafee had also suggested that Nik Faisal, who has gone missing, had forged and misused Suboh\u2019s signature and put it in the hard copies.\n\nNik Faisal and Suboh were the signatories of the SRC account from which money was transferred to Gandingan Mentari, a subsidiary of SRC.\n\nThey were also signatories of the Gandingan Mentari account, where money was transferred to Ihsan Perdana, a company selected to carry out corporate social responsibility programmes for SRC.\n\nThe prosecution contends that RM42 million from Ihsan Perdana was transferred to Najib\u2019s three Ambank accounts at the Jalan Raja Chulan branch through a \u201clayering process\u201d to conceal its origin.\n\nTrial judge Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali sentenced Najib in July last year to 12 years\u2019 jail and ordered him to pay a RM210 million fine after finding him guilty on the seven counts of abuse of power, criminal breach of trust and money laundering in relation to the RM42 million belonging to SRC.\n\nHe is appealing against his conviction and

optimisation, among others\n\nBy NUR HANANI AZMAN\n\nTHE possible merger between Celcom Axiata Bhd and DiGi.com Bhd would allow the combined entity to better compete in the 5G environment via scale, improved balance sheet and operational execution.\n\nWith 5G services offered via a wholesale arrangement (5G special purpose vehicle), mobile operators no longer need to spend heavily on capital expenditure (capex) but instead focus on price and branding, said RHB Investment Bank Bhd analyst Jeffrey Tan.\n\n\u201cConsolidation would, however, see the number of operators reduced and by extension, result in lesser competition,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve.\n\nOn April 8, Axiata Group Bhd and Telenor Asia Pte Ltd announced that they are in advanced discussions on the potential merger of Celcom and Digi, with the joint entity to be known as Celcom Digi Bhd or MergeCo.\n\nAxiata and Digi will have an equal stake of about 33.1% each in MergeCo, while Axiata together with local institutional funds will own over 51% of MergeCo.\n\nThe merged entity would have a combined 19.1 million customers and total revenue of RM12.4 billion.\n\nWhether this merger fails or succeeds, Jeffrey said it is imperative for mobile operators to consider the longer-term sustainability of the industry and to collaborate in ways to ensure their continued existence in the face of digitalisation.\n\n\u201cThere are lower execution risks with this proposal in that the scope of the merger is significantly smaller and national interests are taken into consideration,\u201d he added.\n\nBoth telecommunications companies (telcos) will work towards finalising the agreement in relation to the proposed transaction within the second quarter of 2021 (2Q21) following due diligence and are expected to complete the exercise latest by 1Q22.\n\nInvestors appear to welcome the merger plan. On resumption of trade last Friday, Digi surged 71 sen or 18.93% to RM4.46, while Axiata rose 31 sen or 8.16% to close at RM4.11 per share.\n\nWhile the parties have committed to no forced layoff of staff, the option of voluntary separation schemes and retraining programmes may be introduced.\n\nAmInvestment Bank Bhd (AmInvest) analyst Alex Goh said the merged entity is expected to generate synergies from cost optimisation, re-engineering of network operations, reduced redundancies and procurement rationalisation.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, the merger aims to catalyse revenue growth from dual-brand strategy, integrating operations, digitalisation and coordination on home fibre convergence play.\n\n\u201cThe enlarged scale of operations will also provide additional financial flexibility for future capex rollouts,\u201d he noted in a report last week.\n\nAssuming a 10% reduction in operating expenditures and capex for the combined entity, AmInvest estimated potential savings of RM4.3 billion over five years, which translates to 10% of Celcom Digi\u2019s potential market capitalisation of RM41 billion.\n\nThis is based on Digi\u2019s current share price which has been adjusted for the RM1.7 billion cash outflow.\n\nAmInvest reckons that Digi could benefit more than Celcom from the exercise.\n\n\u201cWe estimate that Digi\u2019s forecasted financial year ending 2022 earnings per share will increase by 5%, while Axiata will decrease by 10% as Digi\u2019s equity appears to be valued 67% above Celcom\u2019s from the share and cash exchange,\u201d said Goh.\n\nThe investment bank maintained an \u2018Overweight\u2019 call on the telecommunications sector with a \u2018Buy\u2019 call on Telekom Malaysia Bhd and Axiata.\n\n\u201cWhile retaining our \u2018Hold\u2019 call on Digi for now, we expect to upgrade to a \u2018Buy\u2019 should the parties complete the value-accretive agreement.\n\n\u201cMaxis Bhd remains a \u2018Hold\u2019 given the consolidation of its rivals will erode its current pole position,\u201d he explained.\n\nHong Leong Investment Bank Bhd (HLIB) analyst Tan J Young said market consolidation usually leads to healthier market rivalry, less price undercutting for market share, improved operational leverage, effective capex spending (no duplication) and more procurement bargaining power.\n\n\u201cThe MergeCo will be the largest telco with revenue and subs market share of circa 34% and more than 40% respectively.\n\n\u201cThe companies believe this is an addressable issue by taking into consideration over-the-top market share,\u201d he said in a note.\n\nAlthough MergeCo will have the largest airwave holdings, J Young does not think this will attract any concern due to its large subscriber base.\n\nHe does not discount the possibility that MergeCo will consolidate its towers by maximising the usage of Digi towers, thus reducing its tower rental from edotco Group Sdn Bhd.\n\nHLIB maintained its \u2018Neutral\u2019 call on the telco sector and reiterated its emphasis on fixed over mobile as they are the prime beneficiaries in broadband or 5G infrastructure deployment.
