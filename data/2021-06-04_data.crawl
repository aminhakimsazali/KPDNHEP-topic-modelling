Ministry (KPDNHEP) and the Finance Ministry have allocated RM600 million this year compared to last year\u2019s RM528 million for the Cooking Oil Stabilisation Scheme (COSS).\n\nKPDNHEP Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi said his ministry is in discussions with several other ministries and agencies related to improving the price implementation mechanism for subsidised and non-subsidised cooking oil in the market to reduce consumers\u2019 burden.\n\n\u201cThe government will inform the outcome of the discussions and the agreed mechanism,\u201d Nanta Linggi said in a statement.\n\nCOSS is a cooking oil subsidy programme aimed at alleviating consumers\u2019 cost of living, applicable to all groups.\n\nNanta Linggi said the subsidy is given to 1kg cooking oil packed in polybags and offered to consumers at RM2.50 per packet despite the price of crude palm oil (CPO) at the world market currently increasing.\n\n\u201cThe government has allocated 60,000 metric tonnes (MT) per month (or 720,000MT per year) which is equivalent to 60 million polybags per month (720 million polybags per year) for all Malaysians.\n\n\u201cThis is based on a consumption rate of 1.8kg per person per month (22kg per person per year),\u201d he said, adding that the government guarantees the quality of subsidised cooking oil sold in polybags are the same as those sold in bottles, as some are manufactured at the same factory.\n\nMeanwhile, cooking oil sold in plastic bottles and cans (2kg, 3kg, 5kg and 17kg) are not subsidised as the prices are determined by the CPO price at the world market.\n\n\u201cPeople have the choice to buy subsidised cooking oil in 1kg polybags or the unsubsidised ones in bottles and cans,\u201d the minister said.\n\nCurrently, the CPO price in the world market has reached more than RM4,500 per MT compared to around RM2,500 per MT before, which is equivalent to approximately RM4.50 per kg before being processed and bottled.\n\nThis means that CPO\u2019s cost alone, before packaged, is already more than RM22 for 5kg, excluding other costs such as processing, bottling, transportation and profits at all levels of factories, wholesalers, distributors and retailers.\n\nNanta Linggi said KPDNHEP enforcement is consistently monitoring the supply and price of goods in the market.\n\n\u201cThe enforcement will not hesitate to take action under the Price Control and Anti-Monitoring Act 2011 if it finds traders who are profiteering on the price of goods, including cooking oil,\u201d he said.\n\nKPDNHEP will exercise its powers such as enforcing controlled prices or ceiling prices.\n\nThe Festive Season Maximum Price Scheme is one example where the ministry enforced price controls for each festive season, where KPDNHEP anticipates

a basic essential household item and among the main ingredients in the economic sector, especially the hotel, restaurant and cafe (HoReCa) segment.\n\nAs such, he said, any drastic price increase would directly impact the public for their daily use of the commodity and also affect household and business spending.\n\n\u201cThe price must be controlled as it will affect the country\u2019s economic growth, whereby consumers will reduce spending and begin to limit other spending to buy the increasingly costly cooking oil.\n\n\u201cAn uncontrolled increase in the price of cooking oil too will lead to other problems such as traders raising their food prices,\u201d he told Bernama.\n\nHe was commenting on the price increase on the two-kilogramme (kg) and five-kg bottled cooking oil detected since several days ago, up to RM12.50 from between RM9 and RM10 and up to RM33.50 from between RM25 and RM28, respectively.\n\nIn a statement, the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) said the government did not fix the price of the bottled cooking oil as they are not subsidised cooking oil.\n\nThe government only set the price of the 1kg subsidised cooking oil in polybag packs at RM2.50 per pack.\n\nKPDNHEP said the price of crude palm oil was decided by the world market, which was uncertain.\n\nCurrently, the price of crude palm oil in the world market has reached over RM4,300 per tonne compared to around RN2,500 previously, equivalent to about RM4.30 per kg before being processed and bottled.\n\nThis means the cost of crude palm oil has exceeded RM21 for 5 kg, without taking into account the other costs such as bottling, transportation and profit at the factory, wholesaler, distributor and retailer levels.\n\nHowever, Shazali said seeing Malaysia as among the largest producers of palm oil in the world, it was illogical if local consumers were forced to bear the burden of its price increase in the global market.\n\nHe suggested that KPDNHEP use the controlled float system for the price of bottled palm oil as had been done to decide the prices of petrol and diesel.\n\nBut one maximum price must be set although it was not a subsidised item, as a long-term solution, he said.\n\nHe also suggested that the government implement the windfall tax on palm oil producing companies which reaped huge profits from the current hike in the price of crude palm oil globally. \u2014 Bernama", "keyword": ["increase", "fix", "oil", "ceiling", "hike", "price", "avoid", "subsidised", "excessive", "crude", "world", "palm", "bottled", "cooking", "kg"],

additional costs of on-site Covid-19 vaccination programmes, including paying government-owned ProtectHealth Corporation, except the cost of vaccines itself that are provided free by the government.\n\nKUALA LUMPUR, June 9 \u2014 The Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) will set a ceiling price on vaccine administration charges under the Covid-19 inoculation programme for industries that use vaccines provided for free from the government.\n\nVaccine Minister Khairy Jamaluddin said today that CITF is working with various ministries, including the International Trade and Industry Ministry (MITI), Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP), Ministry of Tourism, Arts & Culture (MOTAC), Ministry of Works (KKR), and other government agencies to inoculate economic frontliners in the country.\n\nAt the same time, Khairy, who acknowledged a wide range of charges that are being imposed by companies and industries for vaccine administration costs, said that CITF will set a ceiling price for those charges.\n\n\u201cSo CITF is working together with the relevant agencies to set a schedule of fair and reasonable charges that will be borne by industries and companies that participate in the PPV (public-private vaccination) industrial programme,\u201d Khairy said in a joint press conference today with Health Minister Dr Adham Baba.\n\n\u201cThis is above and beyond the charges paid to ProtectHealth to cover the private health care organisers. This includes the hall rental and all the logistics that are necessary.\u201d\n\nEarlier, CodeBlue reported that the shopping malls are paying to the Ministry of Health (MOH)-owned ProtectHealth Corporation for on-site vaccination programmes.\n\nThe Malaysia Shopping Malls Association (PPK) said that from the total of RM50 fee per person for two doses at on-site vaccination in malls, RM30 would go to ProtectHealth. However, ProtectHealth denied collecting payments from shopping centres purportedly rolling out Covid-19 inoculation drives with vaccinators from ProtectHealth.\n\nBut Khairy today said that the industries will absorb other additional costs of on-site vaccination programmes, except the cost of vaccines itself that will be supplied to industries at no cost from the government\u2019s National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme (PICK).\n\n\u201cSecondly, the industries will bear the cost of administering the vaccination. That will include the payment made to the health care organisations that are organised via ProtectHealth Corporation, which is a fully owned company of MOH,\u201d Khairy said.\n\n\u201cNow the other charges for rental of premises and other services \u2014 this is where there are inconsistencies in terms of the additional charges.\u201d\n\nKhairy also announced that the industrial Covid-19 vaccination programme will start on June 16 in Pengerang, Johor, for workers in oil and gas company Petronas.\n\n\u201cWe have identified the Pengerang Complex as a high-risk area and we will be starting our PPV industries for employees in Petronas complex in Pengerang on 16th of June and the others to follow.\u201d\n\nUnlike the industrial Covid-19 vaccination programme, the Malaysian government has been covering the cost of administering vaccines, as the government-owned ProtectHealth pays private medical practitioners RM14 per dose for their inoculation services under PICK that has also utilised private health care facilities as vaccination centres. Both the industrial inoculation drive and PICK use vaccines supplied from the government.\n\nRecently, the government of India announced that private hospitals in the country will only be allowed to charge a maximum \u201cservice charge\u201d of 150 rupees (RM8.49) per dose in a fixed price of the jabs.\n\nThe Indian government said that it will provide Covid-19 vaccinations for free to all adults aged 18 and older from June 21, reversing an earlier decision that allowed states to procure their own vaccine supplies to vaccinate those aged between 18 and 44.\n\nKhairy also said today that the economic frontliners\u2019 vaccination programme will include a wide range of industries in order to pave the way for them to continue operating during movement control orders (MCO) in the country.\n\n\u201cThe arrangement or the discussions that we have been having with various industries, whether they are manufacturing, construction, retail, hospitality, is that if they would like to facilitate the vaccination of their employees, seeing some of these industries operate during the MCOs, we can proceed on a public-private partnership.\u201d", "keyword": ["fix", "vaccination", "ceiling", "khairy", "vaccines", "price", "cost", "industries", "protecthealth", "ministry", "programmes", "covid19", "health", "citf", "programme", "industrial"], "summary": "Khairy Jamaluddin says industries will absorb all additional costs of on-site Covid-19 vaccination programmes, including paying government-owned ProtectHealth Corporation, except the cost of vaccines itself that are provided free by the government.\nKUALA LUMPUR, June 9 \u2014 The Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) will set a ceiling price on vaccine administration charges under the Covid-19 inoculation programme for industries that use vaccines provided for free from the government.\nThis includes the hall rental and all the logistics that are necessary.\u201dEarlier, CodeBlue reported that the shopping malls are paying to the Ministry of Health (MOH)-owned ProtectHealth Corporation for on-site vaccination programmes.\nHowever, ProtectHealth denied collecting payments from shopping centres purportedly rolling out Covid-19 inoculation drives with vaccinators from ProtectHealth.\n\u201cNow the other charges for rental of premises and other services \u2014 this is where there are inconsistencies in terms of the additional charges.\u201dKhairy also announced that the industrial Covid-19 vaccination programme will start on June 16 in Pengerang, Johor, for workers in oil and gas company Petronas.", "news": "CodeBlue", "date": "2021-06-09 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Did MDCC President Catch MITI In A Gaffe?", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wNi8xMi9kaWQtbWRjYy1wcmVzaWRlbnQtY2F0Y2gtbWl0aS1pbi1hLWdhZmZlL9IBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wNi8xMi9kaWQtbWRjYy1wcmVzaWRlbnQtY2F0Y2gtbWl0aS1pbi1hLWdhZmZlL2FtcC8?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Azizul Rahman Ismail", "Maya Suraya"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dyana-wing-so-PAfM5FQ1Drk-unsplash.jpg", "text": "Subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates.\n\nIt began with a Twitter post by Malaysia Digital Chamber of Commerce (MDCC) president, Chris Daniel Wong, of a letter of permission by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI).

Since the 'total lockdown' or full MCO started on June 1, almost a week ago, there has been more confusion and questions now compared to the first MCO. Here is a list of issues I compiled based on media reports and social media postings over the past week.\n\n20 issues we are still unsure about a week into the full MCO:\n\n1) We still don\u2019t have a comprehensive list of which sectors or industries are under the jurisdiction of which ministry.\n\nWhen the full MCO was announced, I issued a statement asking the PN government to make public a comprehensive list of the different sectors of the economy and which ministries are responsible for overseeing them. This list has not been published.\n\nWe need to know this information even though the issuing of approval letters has gone back to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti)'s Cims 3.0 system. This is because the approvals still have to come from the respective ministries and there is still confusion among the ministries themselves as to which sectors they are responsible for.\n\n2) We still don\u2019t know if restaurants are allowed to operate if they have not gotten an approval letter from Miti\n\nOne example is restaurants. Although food and beverages (F&B) are considered essential items and F&B is considered an essential industry, it is unclear which ministry is responsible for approving the continued operations of the many thousands of restaurants in the entire country.\n\nThe Ministry of Housing and Local Government (KPKT) has said that hawkers only need to produce their license from the local authority to operate and will not have to wait for the Miti letter to continue to operate. But this has not stopped some irresponsible enforcement officers from pressuring hawkers into showing their Miti letter.\n\nSome restaurants continue to remain closed even for takeaway meals because they have not gotten their Miti approval letter yet. I have received some reports that the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) thinks that only franchise restaurants come under its purview but not the non-franchise restaurants. The National Security Council (NSC) has not clarified this issue at the time of writing.\n\n3) We don\u2019t know if those operating roadside stalls selling food and drinks can continue to operate without an approval letter from Miti\n\nThis is similar to the point above except that some of these stalls don\u2019t operate with a valid license from the local authority. But how about those who have been given a temporary license to operate by the local authorities in KL and Selangor, for example, during the Covid-19 pandemic? Can they continue to operate? Are the enforcement officers clear on this policy?\n\n4) We don\u2019t know what criteria was used to ban the sale of alcohol but allow the sale of cigarettes\n\nThe Deputy Minister of Trade and Consumer Affairs was reported to have said that the sale of alcohol was banned because it is considered as a non-essential item but the sale of cigarettes would continue to be allowed to cater for the \u201ccigarette addicts\u201d.\n\nLater on, Senior Minister (Security) Ismail Sabri Yaakob expressed his confusion over this statement since shops that sell beer such as 7-11 were still being allowed to operate. Some supermarkets then closed down the section of their operations selling beer and other alcoholic beverages to comply with the \u2018instruction\u2019 from the deputy minister. The Minister of Domestic Trade has not issued any public statement on this issue, as far as I know.\n\nI am not advocating for a ban on cigarettes. What I am asking, like many other Malaysians, is consistency and clarity in government policies on the part of the government.\n\nIf the production and sale of alcohol are banned during the full MCO, has the government considered that opportunists will take the opportunity to make and sell illegal alcohol which will be much more dangerous to consumers? Or have we forgotten the deaths of those through methanol poisoning by consuming cheap and illegal alcohol back in 2019?\n\n5) We still don\u2019t know if automotive/car workshops are allowed to operate if they have not gotten an approval letter from Miti\n\nEven though car workshops are listed as essential under the distributive trade category, it is still unclear which is the ministry that is supposed to give approval for these workshops to continue to operate.\n\nThe Ministry of Transport does not list auto workshops under the sectors that are under its jurisdiction for approval in its Smile application system. The Ministry of Domestic Trade is maintaining an elegant silence on this issue.\n\nSo many car workshops continue to remain closed. This means that those in the logistics sector needing servicing may face some challenges. And those who need to drive to work because they are working in the essential services sector must hope and pray their cars or motorcycles don\u2019t break down or require major servicing.\n\n6) We don\u2019t know if those who are in the distributive trade sector and supplying the essential services are allowed to operate and from which ministry do they seek approval from\n\nI know of someone who imports various types of PPE equipment to supply to the hospitals and Covid-19 quarantine centres in Malaysia. Without getting approval to operate, his company would not have been able to continue the supply of these essential items to the Ministry of Health.\n\nHe tried applying to the Ministry of Domestic Trade but the website and later, the Google form application, crashed. After trying various options, I was made to understand that his approval was finally granted. I am still unsure as to which was the approving ministry for his particular sector of the economy.\n\n7) We don\u2019t know if air-con maintenance and repair are allowed to operate and from which ministry they should seek approval to operate from\n\nCritical maintenance and repair are listed as one of the 17 essential services during the full MCO but I think it only applies to the construction sector. What about other maintenance and service operations that are critical for the continued operations of other essential sectors?\n\nFor example, if the air-conditioning system at a hospital breaks down, we need those in the air-conditioning service sector to do their repair work. For factories producing food and beverages, they also need their air circulation system to be maintained.\n\nIn fact, one can say that given the airborne nature of the Covid-10 virus, the air-conditioning sector should be considered as essential especially for the servicing of commercial (including factories) and government buildings. We are also unsure which ministry the air-con sector comes under.\n\n8) We don\u2019t know if plumbers are allowed to operate and from which ministry they should seek approval to operate from\n\nPlumbers are also important to ensure that the toilets in hospitals, factories, offices, and government buildings are \u201cflowing\u201d smoothly. But which ministry is in charge of approving plumbers to continue to operate under full MCO?\n\n9) We don\u2019t know if those servicing photocopiers and printers are allowed to operate and from which ministry they need to seek approval from\n\nI also received a request from a company whose sales and marketing arm services the photocopiers and provides printing paper to many government ministries and agencies including the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Finance.\n\nIf such companies are not allowed to operate, the ministries and even hospitals, may not have the required paper to print their documents on and also would not be able to have access to photocopiers and printers which have broken down and are being left unrepaired during the full MCO.\n\n10) We don\u2019t know what criteria are being used to approve or not to approve those who are in the essential services supply chain\n\nThere should have been a clear mapping and understanding of the sectors and companies which are critical to the continued operations of the essential services sectors. This can be used as the basis of approving, not approving, or approving at a much-reduced capacity, companies that are part of this supply chain.\n\nAs of today, we have not seen such a mapping or heard any explanations from any minister with regard to the bigger picture surrounding the supply chain for essential services.\n\n11) We don\u2019t know how children are going to learn online when computer and telco shops are closed and the stationery section in the supermarkets are shut down\n\nThe Minister of Education recently announced that classes will continue to remain online when school reopens on June 13 and 14. But many parents who want to repair their laptops and handphones used by their children for online learning at home cannot do so because all of these services are shut down during the full MCO.\n\nEven stationery sections of some supermarkets have been shut down, preventing parents from even buying stationery for their children to use at home.\n\n12) We don\u2019t know how people are supposed to Work From Home (WFH) if their laptops break down and their phones are damaged but IT and handphone shops are closed\n\nSimilarly, for those who have to work from home using their laptops and handphones, they better hope their devices don\u2019t break down during the full MCO since none of the places which repair these devices are open.\n\n(I had a problem with my laptop which could only be fixed at the HQ of the company and I was informed that this could only be done after the end of the full MCO. Thankfully I have the resources to buy a new laptop but what about those who don\u2019t have the funds to buy a laptop during such an emergency?)\n\n13) We don\u2019t know how those people who seek treatments from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) can continue to seek such treatments\n\nI was also told that those seeking treatments from TCM shops cannot do so during the full MCO. The operators of the TCM shops cannot even go to their shops to pack packages of herbs to send to their customers as they are not considered an essential service even though they provide health and other related relief to their customers.\n\n14) We don\u2019t know why hair colouring is not allowed to be sold at pharmacies\n\nApparently, some pharmacies sealed up the section of their stores selling hair colouring as it is deemed as a non-essential item. I cannot understand why the selling of hair colouring at a pharmacy that is already open can be detrimental to our overall fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n15) We don\u2019t know why the home improvement section in some shops e.g. Mr DIY are not allowed to be opened\n\nApparently, some sections of hardware shops that sell home improvement products have been cordoned off. I received a report via a tweet that a person couldn\u2019t buy \u201chooks\u201d for his bathroom from Mr DIY because this section had been cordoned off.\n\n16) We don\u2019t know how people are going to cook at home if some of their home appliances break down since electrical appliance stores are not opened and the sections selling some of these items in supermarkets are closed (e.g. rice cookers and kettles)\n\nHousehold appliances such as rice cookers and kettles have their shelf life. Some may short circuit during the full MCO because of overuse. But we may not be able to buy their replacements because those shops selling electrical appliances are not open and the sections selling some of these items in some supermarkets have been cordoned off.\n\nOf course, there is the option of buying these items online but delivery may take a few days and for some of the semi-urban areas, the preferred option would still be to go to the physical store to procure these items.\n\n17) We don\u2019t know how companies that are in non-essential sectors can continue to maintain their data centres in case of emergencies\n\nI know of a company that is in the non-essential sector but has an important data centre that stores and processes critical information to the financial services sector. For these companies, they need to have one or two people on standby to access the data center in case there is an emergency or if the server breaks down (for whatever reason).\n\nIs MDEC, the agency under the Ministry of Multimedia and Communications, that is in charge of data centre operations, aware of such issues happening?\n\n18) We cannot understand why some companies were issued letters of approval by Miti but when the QR code for the company is scanned by the police, the details reveal that it is considered as a non-essential industry\n\nThis is a bit of a technical issue but is important in terms of preventing companies and their staff from being unfairly fined. Some companies which are listed as essential services suddenly find that they are not classified as an essential service when the QR code on their Miti letter is scanned by the authorities including the police.\n\nThis means that the employees of companies with this sort of letter can potentially be fined thousands of ringgit for violating the full MCO. The photos above show information from an optometrist which is not classified as essential under the QR code scan even though a letter from Miti has been issued to allow this optometrist to continue to operate under the full MCO.\n\n19) We still don\u2019t understand why jogging is allowed but cycling is banned\n\nI appreciate the fact that jogging and exercising alone in our residential areas are still permitted. But I fail to understand why cycling alone is not permitted, especially if this person is cycling within a 10km radius of his or her home.\n\nFurthermore, some people actually cycle to work (including some factory workers in my constituency) and some people cycle to the morning market to do their grocery shopping. Will they be fined for cycling by the enforcement authorities?\n\n20) We still haven\u2019t heard the following ministers come together and separately give a press briefing on the sectors under their jurisdiction - Miti, Home Ministry, Domestic Trade, Communications and Multimedia, Housing and Local Government (just to name a few)\n\nI am not sure if a gag order has been issued by the prime minister to disallow ministers other than Ismail Sabri to have press briefings for the full MCO. But given the current confusion over the SOPs, shouldn\u2019t the ministers from the key ministries (as suggested above) organise a joint press conference to clear the air? We wait with bated breath for this to happen.\n\nONG KIAN MING is the DAP MP for Bangi and a former deputy minister of international trade and industry.", "keyword": ["sops", "lockdown", "dont",

agreed to be included in the Economic Frontliners Vaccination Programme (retail sector) and have employees at their outlets get vaccinated.\n\nShopping centres are currently applying to Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) to host vaccination centres (PPV) on their premises so retailers can sign up for on-site vaccination.\n\nCentral i-City Shopping Centre chief operating officer Anthony Dylan said 65% of its tenants supported the initiative.\n\n\u201cWe are hoping at least 70% of the mall\u2019s tenants will register with us as we play our part in achieving herd immunity as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cWe are proposing one floor of the carpark to be designated as a vaccination centre, with drive-through function.\n\n\u201cThe location is an alternative to event halls and large-scale venues to get the vaccination done.\n\n\u201cIt is conducive with natural ventilation, proper ingress and egress ramps for drive-through as well as as a suitable location nearby to store the vaccine in accordance with government requirements.\u201d\n\nCapitaLand, which manages seven malls namely 3 Damansara, Melawati Mall, The Mines and Sungei Wang Plaza in Klang Valley, Gurney Plaza as well as Queensbay Mall in Penang and East Coast Mall in Kuantan (Pahang), had also written to the authorities to consider using three of its malls as vaccination centres.\n\n\u201cWe are awaiting further clarifications from the authorities on costs and operational requirements.\n\n\u201cWe have communicated with our tenants to take part in this programme, \u201d said CapitaLand Malaysia Retail head Eddie Lim.\n\n\n\nLim: Over 80% of tenants at malls managed by CapitaLand want to sign up for the vaccination programme for retail frontliners.\n\n\u201cMore than 80% of our tenants are interested to sign up for the vaccination programme for retail frontliners.\n\n\u201cAs our malls remain open during this period, the vaccination exercise will help protect the health and well-being of our shoppers, tenants and staff.\n\n\u201cOur aim is to help the government look at different ideas for decentralisation and expedite the whole vaccination process, \u201d he said.\n\nSunway Malls and Theme Parks chief executive officer HC Chan said Sunway Malls planned to join the PPV drive rolled out by the government.\n\n\u201cThis is still in the early stages and we applaud the government\u2019s efforts to speed up vaccination by opening multiple channels across public and private sectors.\n\n\u201cThe road to recovery hinges on how fast and how wide the vaccination reaches the population.\n\n\u201cSunway had rolled out the first private large-scale vaccination centre for frontliners and the general population in Petaling district since March 2021 at Sunway Pyramid Convention Centre.\n\n\u201cSunway Malls has a staff strength of 12,000.\n\n\u201cThese retail frontliners, especially those in the essential sectors such as supermarket, convenience stores, food and beverage operators as well as pharmacies are in contact with the public daily, thus it is important that they get vaccinated as soon as possible to protect themselves and visitors.\n\n\n\nChan: Sunway Malls and Theme Parks\u2019 ultimate aim is to work with the government to achieve herd immunity as fast as possible.\n\n\u201cOur ultimate aim is to work closely with the government to achieve herd

manages Bangsar Village 1,2 and 3 apart from some commercial lots in the area, has offered space for a vaccination centre.\n\nIts leasing manager Vincent Siow said the company had identified a vacant lot on the third floor of Bangsar Village 2 to be used for a vaccination exercise.\n\nNot only would it benefit its retailers\u2019 staff, he said the management had also proposed to include workers in the Telawi commercial centre.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to work with the Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) and KPDNHEP to propose Bangsar Village 2 as a vaccination centre to speed up the national vaccination programme.\n\n\u201cThe response from retailers has been encouraging.\n\n\u201cIf all goes well, we expect about 4,000 workers to receive their vaccination here, \u201d he said.\n\nSuria KLCC in Kuala Lumpur is another mall offering to be a vaccination centre.\n\nSuria KLCC Sdn Bhd, which manages the mall, issued a letter to its retailers on May 31 to submit names of employees interested to be inoculated at the premises by June 1.\n\nThe letter stated that the vaccination exercise will begin sometime this month.\n\n\n\nMost of the tenants at Sunway Pyramid in Petaling Jaya are eager to get their staff vaccinated under the Economic Frontliners Vaccination Programme (retail sector). \u2014 FAIHAN GHANI/The Star\n\nThe tenants that StarMetro spoke to at various malls said they were supportive of the vaccination initiative despite a nominal fee being charged to tenants.\n\nCaring Pharmacy senior pharmacy practice executive Ng Yi Ling said the company was supportive of the programme for shopping centres to be vaccination centres for their retailers.\n\n\u201cOur staff at Caring outlets nationwide are retail frontliners who deal with a huge number of customers, so they are exposed to a certain level of risk during this Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cVaccination for our staff is the best way to protect themselves and at the same time, boosts customer confidence when patronising our stores.\n\n\u201cIt is also geared towards achieving herd immunity the soonest possible.\n\n\u201cCaring encourages all our staff to be vaccinated once the request to set up a vaccination centre in malls is approved by the government, \u201d she told StarMetro.The pharmacy currently has 144 outlets nationwide with more than 1,100 staff, including pharmacists.\n\nNg opined that a small fee charged to tenants in order to get their workers vaccinated was reasonable.\n\n\u201cThe company is willing to chip in as part of its responsibility to get as many employees as we can vaccinated, \u201d she said.\n\n\n\nBangsar Village 2 management has offered to use a vacant lot on its third floor as a vaccination centre not only for mall staff but also for workers in the Telawi commercial area.\n\nDin Tai Fung Malaysia business development director Jeffrey Lim said all its restaurant employees, excluding pregnant women and those with allergies, were supportive of the programme and wanted to get vaccinated as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cOur 11 restaurants nationwide serve customers on a daily basis and we are very heartened to be considered as frontliners.\n\n\u201cWe believe that we can do our part in flattening the curve by getting vaccinated.\n\n\u201cThe company is also bearing the costs for our employees to ensure their safety, \u201d he said.\n\nTGV Cinemas sales and marketing general manager Mohit Bhargava said the company was fully supportive of the initiative.\n\n\u201cWe have enlisted our staff as part of the vaccination programme being rolled out at the shopping centres where we are tenants.\n\n\u201cIt is a collective effort to achieve herd immunity and definitely our frontline staff\u2019s safety is our priority,

said the list of essential services that have been authorised to operate had been clearly stated in his official statement issued on May 31.\n\n\u201cIn the list provided, it has been explained that

month (22kg per person per year),\u201d he said, adding that the government guarantees the quality of subsidised cooking oil sold in polybags are the same as those sold in bottles, as some are

would directly impact the public for their daily use of the commodity and also affect household and business spending.\n\n\u201cThe price must be controlled as it will affect the country\u2019s

will lead to other problems such as traders raising their food prices,\u201d he told Bernama.\n\nHe was commenting on the price increase on the two-kilogramme (kg) and five-kg bottled cooking oil

over RM4,300 per tonne compared to around RN2,500 previously, equivalent to about RM4.30 per kg before being processed and bottled.\n\nThis means the cost of crude palm oil has exceeded RM21 for 5 kg,

the largest producers of palm oil in the world, it was illogical if local consumers were forced to bear the burden of its price increase in the global market.\n\nHe suggested that KPDNHEP use the

additional costs of on-site Covid-19 vaccination programmes, including paying government-owned ProtectHealth Corporation, except the cost of vaccines itself that are provided free by the government.\n\nKUALA LUMPUR, June 9 \u2014 The Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) will set a ceiling price on vaccine administration charges under the Covid-19 inoculation programme for industries that use vaccines provided for free from the government.\n\nVaccine Minister Khairy Jamaluddin said today that CITF is working with various ministries, including the International Trade and Industry Ministry (MITI), Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP), Ministry of Tourism, Arts & Culture (MOTAC), Ministry of Works (KKR), and other government agencies to inoculate economic frontliners in the country.\n\nAt the same time, Khairy, who acknowledged a wide range of charges that are being imposed by companies and industries for vaccine administration costs, said that CITF will set a ceiling price for those charges.\n\n\u201cSo CITF is working together with the relevant agencies to set a schedule of fair and reasonable charges that will be borne by industries and companies that participate in the PPV (public-private vaccination) industrial programme,\u201d Khairy said in a joint press conference today with Health Minister Dr Adham Baba.\n\n\u201cThis is above and beyond the charges paid to ProtectHealth to cover the private health care organisers. This includes the hall rental and all the logistics that are necessary.\u201d\n\nEarlier, CodeBlue reported that the shopping malls are paying to the Ministry of Health (MOH)-owned ProtectHealth Corporation for on-site vaccination programmes.\n\nThe Malaysia Shopping Malls Association (PPK) said that from the total of RM50 fee per person for two doses at on-site vaccination in malls, RM30 would go to ProtectHealth. However, ProtectHealth denied collecting payments from shopping centres purportedly rolling out Covid-19 inoculation drives with vaccinators from ProtectHealth.\n\nBut Khairy today said that the industries will absorb other additional costs of on-site vaccination programmes, except the cost of vaccines itself that will be supplied to industries at no cost from the government\u2019s National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme (PICK).\n\n\u201cSecondly, the industries will bear the cost of administering the vaccination. That will include the payment made to the health care organisations that are organised via ProtectHealth Corporation, which is a fully owned company of MOH,\u201d Khairy said.\n\n\u201cNow the other charges for rental of premises and other services \u2014 this is where there are inconsistencies in terms of the additional charges.\u201d\n\nKhairy also announced that the industrial Covid-19 vaccination programme will start on June 16 in Pengerang, Johor, for workers in oil and gas company Petronas.\n\n\u201cWe have identified the Pengerang Complex as a high-risk area and we will be starting our PPV industries for employees in Petronas complex in Pengerang on 16th of June and the others to follow.\u201d\n\nUnlike the industrial Covid-19 vaccination programme, the Malaysian government has been covering the cost of administering vaccines, as the government-owned ProtectHealth pays private medical practitioners RM14 per dose for their inoculation services under PICK that has also utilised private health care facilities as vaccination centres. Both the industrial inoculation drive and PICK use vaccines supplied from the government.\n\nRecently, the government of India announced that private hospitals in the country will only be allowed to charge a maximum \u201cservice charge\u201d of 150 rupees (RM8.49) per dose in a fixed price of the jabs.\n\nThe Indian government said that it will provide Covid-19 vaccinations for free to all adults aged 18 and older from June 21, reversing an earlier decision that allowed states to procure their own vaccine supplies to vaccinate those aged between 18 and 44.\n\nKhairy also said today that the economic frontliners\u2019 vaccination programme will include a wide range of industries in order to pave the way for them to continue operating during movement control orders (MCO) in the country.\n\n\u201cThe arrangement or the discussions that we have been having with various industries, whether they are manufacturing, construction, retail, hospitality, is that if they would like to facilitate the vaccination of their employees, seeing some of these industries operate during the MCOs, we can proceed on a public-private partnership.\u201d", "keyword": ["fix", "vaccination", "ceiling", "khairy", "vaccines", "price", "cost", "industries", "protecthealth", "ministry", "programmes", "covid19", "health", "citf", "programme", "industrial"], "summary": "Khairy Jamaluddin says industries will absorb all additional costs of on-site Covid-19 vaccination programmes, including paying government-owned ProtectHealth Corporation, except the cost of vaccines itself that are provided free by the government.\nKUALA LUMPUR, June 9 \u2014 The Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) will set a ceiling price on vaccine administration charges under the Covid-19 inoculation programme for industries that use vaccines provided for free from the government.\nThis includes the hall rental and all the logistics that are necessary.\u201dEarlier, CodeBlue reported that the shopping malls are paying to the Ministry of Health (MOH)-owned ProtectHealth Corporation for on-site vaccination programmes.\nHowever, ProtectHealth denied collecting payments from shopping centres purportedly rolling out Covid-19 inoculation drives with vaccinators from ProtectHealth.\n\u201cNow the other charges for rental of premises and other services \u2014 this is where there are inconsistencies in terms of the additional charges.\u201dKhairy also announced that the industrial Covid-19 vaccination programme will start on June 16 in Pengerang, Johor, for workers in oil and gas company Petronas.", "news": "CodeBlue", "date": "2021-06-09 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Did MDCC President Catch MITI In A Gaffe?", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wNi8xMi9kaWQtbWRjYy1wcmVzaWRlbnQtY2F0Y2gtbWl0aS1pbi1hLWdhZmZlL9IBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wNi8xMi9kaWQtbWRjYy1wcmVzaWRlbnQtY2F0Y2gtbWl0aS1pbi1hLWdhZmZlL2FtcC8?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Azizul Rahman Ismail", "Maya Suraya"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dyana-wing-so-PAfM5FQ1Drk-unsplash.jpg", "text": "Subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates.\n\nIt began with a Twitter post by Malaysia Digital Chamber of Commerce (MDCC) president, Chris Daniel Wong, of a letter of permission by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI).

Since the 'total lockdown' or full MCO started on June 1, almost a week ago, there has been more confusion and questions now compared to the first MCO. Here is a list of issues I compiled based on media reports and social media postings over the past week.\n\n20 issues we are still unsure about a week into the full MCO:\n\n1) We still don\u2019t have a comprehensive list of which sectors or industries are under the jurisdiction of which ministry.\n\nWhen the full MCO was announced, I issued a statement asking the PN government to make public a comprehensive list of the different sectors of the economy and which ministries are responsible for overseeing them. This list has not been published.\n\nWe need to know this information even though the issuing of approval letters has gone back to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti)'s Cims 3.0 system. This is because the approvals still have to come from the respective ministries and there is still confusion among the ministries themselves as to which sectors they are responsible for.\n\n2) We still don\u2019t know if restaurants are allowed to operate if they have not gotten an approval letter from Miti\n\nOne example is restaurants. Although food and beverages (F&B) are considered essential items and F&B is considered an essential industry, it is unclear which ministry is responsible for approving the continued operations of the many thousands of restaurants in the entire country.\n\nThe Ministry of Housing and Local Government (KPKT) has said that hawkers only need to produce their license from the local authority to operate and will not have to wait for the Miti letter to continue to operate. But this has not stopped some irresponsible enforcement officers from pressuring hawkers into showing their Miti letter.\n\nSome restaurants continue to remain closed even for takeaway meals because they have not gotten their Miti approval letter yet. I have received some reports that the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) thinks that only franchise restaurants come under its purview but not the non-franchise restaurants. The National Security Council (NSC) has not clarified this issue at the time of writing.\n\n3) We don\u2019t know if those operating roadside stalls selling food and drinks can continue to operate without an approval letter from Miti\n\nThis is similar to the point above except that some of these stalls don\u2019t operate with a valid license from the local authority. But how about those who have been given a temporary license to operate by the local authorities in KL and Selangor, for example, during the Covid-19 pandemic? Can they continue to operate? Are the enforcement officers clear on this policy?\n\n4) We don\u2019t know what criteria was used to ban the sale of alcohol but allow the sale of cigarettes\n\nThe Deputy Minister of Trade and Consumer Affairs was reported to have said that the sale of alcohol was banned because it is considered as a non-essential item but the sale of cigarettes would continue to be allowed to cater for the \u201ccigarette addicts\u201d.\n\nLater on, Senior Minister (Security) Ismail Sabri Yaakob expressed his confusion over this statement since shops that sell beer such as 7-11 were still being allowed to operate. Some supermarkets then closed down the section of their operations selling beer and other alcoholic beverages to comply with the \u2018instruction\u2019 from the deputy minister. The Minister of Domestic Trade has not issued any public statement on this issue, as far as I know.\n\nI am not advocating for a ban on cigarettes. What I am asking, like many other Malaysians, is consistency and clarity in government policies on the part of the government.\n\nIf the production and sale of alcohol are banned during the full MCO, has the government considered that opportunists will take the opportunity to make and sell illegal alcohol which will be much more dangerous to consumers? Or have we forgotten the deaths of those through methanol poisoning by consuming cheap and illegal alcohol back in 2019?\n\n5) We still don\u2019t know if automotive/car workshops are allowed to operate if they have not gotten an approval letter from Miti\n\nEven though car workshops are listed as essential under the distributive trade category, it is still unclear which is the ministry that is supposed to give approval for these workshops to continue to operate.\n\nThe Ministry of Transport does not list auto workshops under the sectors that are under its jurisdiction for approval in its Smile application system. The Ministry of Domestic Trade is maintaining an elegant silence on this issue.\n\nSo many car workshops continue to remain closed. This means that those in the logistics sector needing servicing may face some challenges. And those who need to drive to work because they are working in the essential services sector must hope and pray their cars or motorcycles don\u2019t break down or require major servicing.\n\n6) We don\u2019t know if those who are in the distributive trade sector and supplying the essential services are allowed to operate and from which ministry do they seek approval from\n\nI know of someone who imports various types of PPE equipment to supply to the hospitals and Covid-19 quarantine centres in Malaysia. Without getting approval to operate, his company would not have been able to continue the supply of these essential items to the Ministry of Health.\n\nHe tried applying to the Ministry of Domestic Trade but the website and later, the Google form application, crashed. After trying various options, I was made to understand that his approval was finally granted. I am still unsure as to which was the approving ministry for his particular sector of the economy.\n\n7) We don\u2019t know if air-con maintenance and repair are allowed to operate and from which ministry they should seek approval to operate from\n\nCritical maintenance and repair are listed as one of the 17 essential services during the full MCO but I think it only applies to the construction sector. What about other maintenance and service operations that are critical for the continued operations of other essential sectors?\n\nFor example, if the air-conditioning system at a hospital breaks down, we need those in the air-conditioning service sector to do their repair work. For factories producing food and beverages, they also need their air circulation system to be maintained.\n\nIn fact, one can say that given the airborne nature of the Covid-10 virus, the air-conditioning sector should be considered as essential especially for the servicing of commercial (including factories) and government buildings. We are also unsure which ministry the air-con sector comes under.\n\n8) We don\u2019t know if plumbers are allowed to operate and from which ministry they should seek approval to operate from\n\nPlumbers are also important to ensure that the toilets in hospitals, factories, offices, and government buildings are \u201cflowing\u201d smoothly. But which ministry is in charge of approving plumbers to continue to operate under full MCO?\n\n9) We don\u2019t know if those servicing photocopiers and printers are allowed to operate and from which ministry they need to seek approval from\n\nI also received a request from a company whose sales and marketing arm services the photocopiers and provides printing paper to many government ministries and agencies including the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Finance.\n\nIf such companies are not allowed to operate, the ministries and even hospitals, may not have the required paper to print their documents on and also would not be able to have access to photocopiers and printers which have broken down and are being left unrepaired during the full MCO.\n\n10) We don\u2019t know what criteria are being used to approve or not to approve those who are in the essential services supply chain\n\nThere should have been a clear mapping and understanding of the sectors and companies which are critical to the continued operations of the essential services sectors. This can be used as the basis of approving, not approving, or approving at a much-reduced capacity, companies that are part of this supply chain.\n\nAs of today, we have not seen such a mapping or heard any explanations from any minister with regard to the bigger picture surrounding the supply chain for essential services.\n\n11) We don\u2019t know how children are going to learn online when computer and telco shops are closed and the stationery section in the supermarkets are shut down\n\nThe Minister of Education recently announced that classes will continue to remain online when school reopens on June 13 and 14. But many parents who want to repair their laptops and handphones used by their children for online learning at home cannot do so because all of these services are shut down during the full MCO.\n\nEven stationery sections of some supermarkets have been shut down, preventing parents from even buying stationery for their children to use at home.\n\n12) We don\u2019t know how people are supposed to Work From Home (WFH) if their laptops break down and their phones are damaged but IT and handphone shops are closed\n\nSimilarly, for those who have to work from home using their laptops and handphones, they better hope their devices don\u2019t break down during the full MCO since none of the places which repair these devices are open.\n\n(I had a problem with my laptop which could only be fixed at the HQ of the company and I was informed that this could only be done after the end of the full MCO. Thankfully I have the resources to buy a new laptop but what about those who don\u2019t have the funds to buy a laptop during such an emergency?)\n\n13) We don\u2019t know how those people who seek treatments from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) can continue to seek such treatments\n\nI was also told that those seeking treatments from TCM shops cannot do so during the full MCO. The operators of the TCM shops cannot even go to their shops to pack packages of herbs to send to their customers as they are not considered an essential service even though they provide health and other related relief to their customers.\n\n14) We don\u2019t know why hair colouring is not allowed to be sold at pharmacies\n\nApparently, some pharmacies sealed up the section of their stores selling hair colouring as it is deemed as a non-essential item. I cannot understand why the selling of hair colouring at a pharmacy that is already open can be detrimental to our overall fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n15) We don\u2019t know why the home improvement section in some shops e.g. Mr DIY are not allowed to be opened\n\nApparently, some sections of hardware shops that sell home improvement products have been cordoned off. I received a report via a tweet that a person couldn\u2019t buy \u201chooks\u201d for his bathroom from Mr DIY because this section had been cordoned off.\n\n16) We don\u2019t know how people are going to cook at home if some of their home appliances break down since electrical appliance stores are not opened and the sections selling some of these items in supermarkets are closed (e.g. rice cookers and kettles)\n\nHousehold appliances such as rice cookers and kettles have their shelf life. Some may short circuit during the full MCO because of overuse. But we may not be able to buy their replacements because those shops selling electrical appliances are not open and the sections selling some of these items in some supermarkets have been cordoned off.\n\nOf course, there is the option of buying these items online but delivery may take a few days and for some of the semi-urban areas, the preferred option would still be to go to the physical store to procure these items.\n\n17) We don\u2019t know how companies that are in non-essential sectors can continue to maintain their data centres in case of emergencies\n\nI know of a company that is in the non-essential sector but has an important data centre that stores and processes critical information to the financial services sector. For these companies, they need to have one or two people on standby to access the data center in case there is an emergency or if the server breaks down (for whatever reason).\n\nIs MDEC, the agency under the Ministry of Multimedia and Communications, that is in charge of data centre operations, aware of such issues happening?\n\n18) We cannot understand why some companies were issued letters of approval by Miti but when the QR code for the company is scanned by the police, the details reveal that it is considered as a non-essential industry\n\nThis is a bit of a technical issue but is important in terms of preventing companies and their staff from being unfairly fined. Some companies which are listed as essential services suddenly find that they are not classified as an essential service when the QR code on their Miti letter is scanned by the authorities including the police.\n\nThis means that the employees of companies with this sort of letter can potentially be fined thousands of ringgit for violating the full MCO. The photos above show information from an optometrist which is not classified as essential under the QR code scan even though a letter from Miti has been issued to allow this optometrist to continue to operate under the full MCO.\n\n19) We still don\u2019t understand why jogging is allowed but cycling is banned\n\nI appreciate the fact that jogging and exercising alone in our residential areas are still permitted. But I fail to understand why cycling alone is not permitted, especially if this person is cycling within a 10km radius of his or her home.\n\nFurthermore, some people actually cycle to work (including some factory workers in my constituency) and some people cycle to the morning market to do their grocery shopping. Will they be fined for cycling by the enforcement authorities?\n\n20) We still haven\u2019t heard the following ministers come together and separately give a press briefing on the sectors under their jurisdiction - Miti, Home Ministry, Domestic Trade, Communications and Multimedia, Housing and Local Government (just to name a few)\n\nI am not sure if a gag order has been issued by the prime minister to disallow ministers other than Ismail Sabri to have press briefings for the full MCO. But given the current confusion over the SOPs, shouldn\u2019t the ministers from the key ministries (as suggested above) organise a joint press conference to clear the air? We wait with bated breath for this to happen.\n\nONG KIAN MING is the DAP MP for Bangi and a former deputy minister of international trade and industry.", "keyword": ["sops", "lockdown", "dont",

Anthony Dylan said 65% of its tenants supported the initiative.\n\n\u201cWe are hoping at least 70% of the mall\u2019s tenants will register with us as we play our part in achieving herd immunity as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cWe are proposing one floor of the carpark to be designated as a vaccination centre, with drive-through function.\n\n\u201cThe location is an alternative to event halls and large-scale venues to get the vaccination done.\n\n\u201cIt is conducive with natural ventilation, proper ingress and egress ramps for drive-through as well as as a suitable location nearby to store the vaccine in accordance with government requirements.\u201d\n\nCapitaLand, which manages seven malls namely 3 Damansara, Melawati Mall, The Mines and Sungei Wang Plaza in Klang Valley, Gurney Plaza as well as Queensbay Mall in Penang and East Coast Mall in Kuantan (Pahang), had also written to the authorities to consider using three of its malls as vaccination centres.\n\n\u201cWe are awaiting further clarifications from the authorities on costs and operational requirements.\n\n\u201cWe have communicated with our tenants to take part in this programme, \u201d said CapitaLand Malaysia Retail head Eddie Lim.\n\n\n\nLim: Over 80% of tenants at malls managed by CapitaLand want to sign up for the vaccination programme for retail frontliners.\n\n\u201cMore than 80% of our tenants are interested to sign up for the vaccination programme for retail frontliners.\n\n\u201cAs our malls remain open during this period, the vaccination exercise will help protect the health and well-being of our shoppers, tenants and staff.\n\n\u201cOur aim is to help the government look at different ideas for decentralisation and expedite the whole vaccination process, \u201d he said.\n\nSunway Malls and Theme Parks chief executive officer HC Chan said Sunway Malls planned to join the PPV drive rolled out by the government.\n\n\u201cThis is still in the early stages and we applaud the government\u2019s efforts to speed up vaccination by opening multiple channels across public and private sectors.\n\n\u201cThe road to recovery hinges on how fast and how wide the vaccination reaches the population.\n\n\u201cSunway had rolled out the first private large-scale vaccination centre for frontliners and the general population in Petaling district since March 2021 at Sunway Pyramid Convention Centre.\n\n\u201cSunway Malls has a staff strength of 12,000.\n\n\u201cThese retail frontliners, especially those in the essential sectors such as supermarket, convenience stores, food and beverage operators as well as pharmacies are in contact with the public daily, thus it is important that they get vaccinated as soon as possible to protect themselves and visitors.\n\n\n\nChan: Sunway Malls and Theme Parks\u2019 ultimate aim is to work with the government to achieve herd immunity as fast as possible.\n\n\u201cOur ultimate aim is to work closely with the government to achieve herd

manages Bangsar Village 1,2 and 3 apart from some commercial lots in the area, has offered space for a vaccination centre.\n\nIts leasing manager Vincent Siow said the company had identified a vacant lot on the third floor of Bangsar Village 2 to be used for a vaccination exercise.\n\nNot only would it benefit its retailers\u2019 staff, he said the management had also proposed to include workers in the Telawi commercial centre.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to work with the Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) and KPDNHEP to propose Bangsar Village 2 as a vaccination centre to speed up the national vaccination programme.\n\n\u201cThe response from retailers has been encouraging.\n\n\u201cIf all goes well, we expect about 4,000 workers to receive their vaccination here, \u201d he said.\n\nSuria KLCC in Kuala Lumpur is another mall offering to be a vaccination centre.\n\nSuria KLCC Sdn Bhd, which manages the mall, issued a letter to its retailers on May 31 to submit names of employees interested to be inoculated at the premises by June 1.\n\nThe letter stated that the vaccination exercise will begin sometime this month.\n\n\n\nMost of the tenants at Sunway Pyramid in

was supportive of the programme for shopping centres to be vaccination centres for their retailers.\n\n\u201cOur staff at Caring outlets nationwide are retail frontliners who deal with a huge number of customers, so they are exposed to a certain level of risk during this Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cVaccination for our staff is the best way to protect themselves and at the same time, boosts customer confidence when patronising our stores.\n\n\u201cIt is also geared towards achieving herd immunity the soonest possible.\n\n\u201cCaring encourages all our staff to be vaccinated once the request to set up a vaccination centre in malls is approved by the government, \u201d she told StarMetro.The pharmacy currently has 144 outlets nationwide with more than 1,100 staff, including pharmacists.\n\nNg opined that a small fee charged to tenants in order to get their workers vaccinated was reasonable.\n\n\u201cThe company is willing to chip in as part of its responsibility to get as many employees as we can vaccinated, \u201d she said.\n\n\n\nBangsar Village 2 management has offered to use a vacant lot on its third floor as a vaccination centre not only for mall staff but also for workers in the Telawi commercial area.\n\nDin Tai Fung Malaysia business development director Jeffrey Lim said all its restaurant employees, excluding pregnant women and those with allergies, were supportive of the programme and wanted to get vaccinated as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cOur 11 restaurants nationwide serve customers on a daily basis and we are very heartened to be considered as frontliners.\n\n\u201cWe believe that we can do our part in flattening the curve by getting vaccinated.\n\n\u201cThe company is also bearing the costs for our employees to ensure their safety, \u201d he said.\n\nTGV Cinemas sales and marketing general manager Mohit Bhargava said the company was fully supportive of the initiative.\n\n\u201cWe have enlisted our staff as part of the vaccination

Ministry (KPDNHEP) and the Finance Ministry have allocated RM600 million this year compared to last year\u2019s RM528 million for the Cooking Oil Stabilisation Scheme (COSS).\n\nKPDNHEP Minister Datuk

cooking oil in the market to reduce consumers\u2019 burden.\n\n\u201cThe government will inform the outcome of the discussions and the agreed mechanism,\u201d Nanta Linggi said in a statement.\n\nCOSS is a cooking oil subsidy programme aimed at alleviating consumers\u2019 cost of living, applicable to all groups.\n\nNanta Linggi said the subsidy is given to 1kg cooking oil packed in polybags and offered to consumers at RM2.50 per packet despite the price of crude palm oil (CPO) at the world market currently increasing.\n\n\u201cThe government has allocated 60,000 metric tonnes (MT) per month (or 720,000MT per year) which is equivalent to 60 million polybags per month (720 million polybags per year) for all Malaysians.\n\n\u201cThis is based on a consumption rate of 1.8kg per person per month (22kg per person per year),\u201d he said, adding that the government guarantees the quality of subsidised cooking oil sold in polybags are the same as those sold in bottles, as some are manufactured at the same factory.\n\nMeanwhile, cooking oil sold in plastic bottles and cans (2kg, 3kg, 5kg and 17kg) are not subsidised as the prices are determined by the CPO price at the world market.\n\n\u201cPeople have the choice to buy subsidised cooking oil in 1kg polybags or the unsubsidised ones in bottles and cans,\u201d the minister said.\n\nCurrently, the CPO price in the world market has reached more than RM4,500 per MT compared to around RM2,500 per MT before, which is equivalent to approximately RM4.50 per kg before being processed and bottled.\n\nThis means that CPO\u2019s cost alone, before packaged, is already more than RM22 for 5kg, excluding other costs such as processing, bottling, transportation and profits at all levels of factories, wholesalers, distributors and retailers.\n\nNanta Linggi said KPDNHEP enforcement is consistently monitoring the supply and price of goods in the market.\n\n\u201cThe enforcement will not hesitate to take action under the Price Control and Anti-Monitoring Act 2011 if it finds traders who are profiteering on the price of goods, including cooking oil,\u201d he said.\n\nKPDNHEP will exercise its powers such as enforcing controlled prices or ceiling prices.\n\nThe Festive Season Maximum Price Scheme is one example where the ministry enforced price controls for each festive season, where KPDNHEP anticipates

additional costs of on-site Covid-19 vaccination programmes, including paying government-owned ProtectHealth Corporation, except the cost of vaccines itself that are provided free by the government.\n\nKUALA LUMPUR, June 9 \u2014 The Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) will set a ceiling price on vaccine administration charges under the Covid-19 inoculation programme for industries that use vaccines provided for free from the government.\n\nVaccine Minister Khairy Jamaluddin said today that CITF is working with various ministries, including the International Trade and Industry Ministry (MITI), Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP), Ministry of Tourism, Arts & Culture (MOTAC), Ministry of Works (KKR), and other government agencies to inoculate economic frontliners in the country.\n\nAt the same time, Khairy, who acknowledged a wide range of charges that are being imposed by companies and industries for vaccine administration costs, said that CITF will set a ceiling price for those charges.\n\n\u201cSo CITF is working together with the relevant agencies to set a schedule of fair and reasonable charges that will be borne by industries and companies that participate in the PPV (public-private vaccination) industrial programme,\u201d Khairy said in a joint press conference today with Health Minister Dr Adham Baba.\n\n\u201cThis is above and beyond the charges paid to ProtectHealth to cover the private health care organisers. This includes the hall rental and all the logistics that are necessary.\u201d\n\nEarlier, CodeBlue reported that the shopping malls are paying to the Ministry of Health (MOH)-owned ProtectHealth Corporation for on-site vaccination programmes.\n\nThe Malaysia Shopping Malls Association (PPK) said that from the total of RM50 fee per person for two doses at on-site vaccination in malls, RM30 would go to ProtectHealth. However, ProtectHealth denied collecting payments from shopping centres purportedly rolling out Covid-19 inoculation drives with vaccinators from ProtectHealth.\n\nBut Khairy today said that the industries will absorb other additional costs of on-site vaccination programmes, except the cost of vaccines itself that will be supplied to industries at no cost from the government\u2019s National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme (PICK).\n\n\u201cSecondly, the industries will bear the cost of administering the vaccination. That will include the payment made to the health care organisations that are organised via ProtectHealth Corporation, which is a fully owned company of MOH,\u201d Khairy said.\n\n\u201cNow the other charges for rental of premises and other services \u2014 this is where there are inconsistencies in terms of the additional charges.\u201d\n\nKhairy also announced that the industrial Covid-19 vaccination programme will start on June 16 in Pengerang, Johor, for workers in oil and gas company Petronas.\n\n\u201cWe have identified the Pengerang Complex as a high-risk area and we will be starting our PPV industries for employees in Petronas complex in Pengerang on 16th of June and the others to follow.\u201d\n\nUnlike the industrial Covid-19 vaccination programme, the Malaysian government has been covering the cost of administering vaccines, as the government-owned ProtectHealth pays private medical practitioners RM14 per dose for their inoculation services under PICK that has also utilised private health care facilities as vaccination centres. Both the industrial inoculation drive and PICK use vaccines supplied from the government.\n\nRecently, the government of India announced that private hospitals in the country will only be allowed to charge a maximum \u201cservice charge\u201d of 150 rupees (RM8.49) per dose in a fixed price of the jabs.\n\nThe Indian government said that it will provide Covid-19 vaccinations for free to all adults aged 18 and older from June 21, reversing an earlier decision that allowed states to procure their own vaccine supplies to vaccinate those aged between 18 and 44.\n\nKhairy also said today that the economic frontliners\u2019 vaccination programme will include a wide range of industries in order to pave the way for them to continue operating during movement control orders (MCO) in the country.\n\n\u201cThe arrangement or the discussions that we have been having with various industries, whether they are manufacturing, construction, retail, hospitality, is that if they would like to facilitate the vaccination of their employees, seeing some of these industries operate during the MCOs, we can proceed on a public-private partnership.\u201d", "keyword": ["fix", "vaccination", "ceiling", "khairy", "vaccines", "price", "cost", "industries", "protecthealth", "ministry", "programmes", "covid19", "health", "citf", "programme", "industrial"], "summary": "Khairy Jamaluddin says industries will absorb all additional costs of on-site Covid-19 vaccination programmes, including paying government-owned ProtectHealth Corporation, except the cost of vaccines itself that are provided free by the government.\nKUALA LUMPUR, June 9 \u2014 The Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) will set a ceiling price on vaccine administration charges under the Covid-19 inoculation programme for industries that use vaccines provided for free from the government.\nThis includes the hall rental and all the logistics that are necessary.\u201dEarlier, CodeBlue reported that the shopping malls are paying to the Ministry of Health (MOH)-owned ProtectHealth Corporation for on-site vaccination programmes.\nHowever, ProtectHealth denied collecting payments from shopping centres purportedly rolling out Covid-19 inoculation drives with vaccinators from ProtectHealth.\n\u201cNow the other charges for rental of premises and other services \u2014 this is where there are inconsistencies in terms of the additional charges.\u201dKhairy also announced that the industrial Covid-19 vaccination programme will start on June 16 in Pengerang, Johor, for workers in oil and gas company Petronas.", "news": "CodeBlue", "date": "2021-06-09 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Did MDCC President Catch MITI In A Gaffe?", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wNi8xMi9kaWQtbWRjYy1wcmVzaWRlbnQtY2F0Y2gtbWl0aS1pbi1hLWdhZmZlL9IBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wNi8xMi9kaWQtbWRjYy1wcmVzaWRlbnQtY2F0Y2gtbWl0aS1pbi1hLWdhZmZlL2FtcC8?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Azizul Rahman Ismail", "Maya Suraya"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dyana-wing-so-PAfM5FQ1Drk-unsplash.jpg", "text": "Subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates.\n\nIt began with a Twitter post by Malaysia Digital Chamber of Commerce (MDCC) president, Chris Daniel Wong, of a letter of permission by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI).

Since the 'total lockdown' or full MCO started on June 1, almost a week ago, there has been more confusion and questions now compared to the first MCO. Here is a list of issues I compiled based on media reports and social media postings over the past week.\n\n20 issues we are still unsure about a week into the full MCO:\n\n1) We still don\u2019t have a comprehensive list of which sectors or industries are under the jurisdiction of which ministry.\n\nWhen the full MCO was announced, I issued a statement asking the PN government to make public a comprehensive list of the different sectors of the economy and which ministries are responsible for overseeing them. This list has not been published.\n\nWe need to know this information even though the issuing of approval letters has gone back to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti)'s Cims 3.0 system. This is because the approvals still have to come from the respective ministries and there is still confusion among the ministries themselves as to which sectors they are responsible for.\n\n2) We still don\u2019t know if restaurants are allowed to operate if they have not gotten an approval letter from Miti\n\nOne example is restaurants. Although food and beverages (F&B) are considered essential items and F&B is considered an essential industry, it is unclear which ministry is responsible for approving the continued operations of the many thousands of restaurants in the entire country.\n\nThe Ministry of Housing and Local Government (KPKT) has said that hawkers only need to produce their license from the local authority to operate and will not have to wait for the Miti letter to continue to operate. But this has not stopped some irresponsible enforcement officers from pressuring hawkers into showing their Miti letter.\n\nSome restaurants continue to remain closed even for takeaway meals because they have not gotten their Miti approval letter yet. I have received some reports that the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) thinks that only franchise restaurants come under its purview but not the non-franchise restaurants. The National Security Council (NSC) has not clarified this issue at the time of writing.\n\n3) We don\u2019t know if those operating roadside stalls selling food and drinks can continue to operate without an approval letter from Miti\n\nThis is similar to the point above except that some of these stalls don\u2019t operate with a valid license from the local authority. But how about those who have been given a temporary license to operate by the local authorities in KL and Selangor, for example, during the Covid-19 pandemic? Can they continue to operate? Are the enforcement officers clear on this policy?\n\n4) We don\u2019t know what criteria was used to ban the sale of alcohol but allow the sale of cigarettes\n\nThe Deputy Minister of Trade and Consumer Affairs was reported to have said that the sale of alcohol was banned because it is considered as a non-essential item but the sale of cigarettes would continue to be allowed to cater for the \u201ccigarette addicts\u201d.\n\nLater on, Senior Minister (Security) Ismail Sabri Yaakob expressed his confusion over this statement since shops that sell beer such as 7-11 were still being allowed to operate. Some supermarkets then closed down the section of their operations selling beer and other alcoholic beverages to comply with the \u2018instruction\u2019 from the deputy minister. The Minister of Domestic Trade has not issued any public statement on this issue, as far as I know.\n\nI am not advocating for a ban on cigarettes. What I am asking, like many other Malaysians, is consistency and clarity in government policies on the part of the government.\n\nIf the production and sale of alcohol are banned during the full MCO, has the government considered that opportunists will take the opportunity to make and sell illegal alcohol which will be much more dangerous to consumers? Or have we forgotten the deaths of those through methanol poisoning by consuming cheap and illegal alcohol back in 2019?\n\n5) We still don\u2019t know if automotive/car workshops are allowed to operate if they have not gotten an approval letter from Miti\n\nEven though car workshops are listed as essential under the distributive trade category, it is still unclear which is the ministry that is supposed to give approval for these workshops to continue to operate.\n\nThe Ministry of Transport does not list auto workshops under the sectors that are under its jurisdiction for approval in its Smile application system. The Ministry of Domestic Trade is maintaining an elegant silence on this issue.\n\nSo many car workshops continue to remain closed. This means that those in the logistics sector needing servicing may face some challenges. And those who need to drive to work because they are working in the essential services sector must hope and pray their cars or motorcycles don\u2019t break down or require major servicing.\n\n6) We don\u2019t know if those who are in the distributive trade sector and supplying the essential services are allowed to operate and from which ministry do they seek approval from\n\nI know of someone who imports various types of PPE equipment to supply to the hospitals and Covid-19 quarantine centres in Malaysia. Without getting approval to operate, his company would not have been able to continue the supply of these essential items to the Ministry of Health.\n\nHe tried applying to the Ministry of Domestic Trade but the website and later, the Google form application, crashed. After trying various options, I was made to understand that his approval was finally granted. I am still unsure as to which was the approving ministry for his particular sector of the economy.\n\n7) We don\u2019t know if air-con maintenance and repair are allowed to operate and from which ministry they should seek approval to operate from\n\nCritical maintenance and repair are listed as one of the 17 essential services during the full MCO but I think it only applies to the construction sector. What about other maintenance and service operations that are critical for the continued operations of other essential sectors?\n\nFor example, if the air-conditioning system at a hospital breaks down, we need those in the air-conditioning service sector to do their repair work. For factories producing food and beverages, they also need their air circulation system to be maintained.\n\nIn fact, one can say that given the airborne nature of the Covid-10 virus, the air-conditioning sector should be considered as essential especially for the servicing of commercial (including factories) and government buildings. We are also unsure which ministry the air-con sector comes under.\n\n8) We don\u2019t know if plumbers are allowed to operate and from which ministry they should seek approval to operate from\n\nPlumbers are also important to ensure that the toilets in hospitals, factories, offices, and government buildings are \u201cflowing\u201d smoothly. But which ministry is in charge of approving plumbers to continue to operate under full MCO?\n\n9) We don\u2019t know if those servicing photocopiers and printers are allowed to operate and from which ministry they need to seek approval from\n\nI also received a request from a company whose sales and marketing arm services the photocopiers and provides printing paper to many government ministries and agencies including the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Finance.\n\nIf such companies are not allowed to operate, the ministries and even hospitals, may not have the required paper to print their documents on and also would not be able to have access to photocopiers and printers which have broken down and are being left unrepaired during the full MCO.\n\n10) We don\u2019t know what criteria are being used to approve or not to approve those who are in the essential services supply chain\n\nThere should have been a clear mapping and understanding of the sectors and companies which are critical to the continued operations of the essential services sectors. This can be used as the basis of approving, not approving, or approving at a much-reduced capacity, companies that are part of this supply chain.\n\nAs of today, we have not seen such a mapping or heard any explanations from any minister with regard to the bigger picture surrounding the supply chain for essential services.\n\n11) We don\u2019t know how children are going to learn online when computer and telco shops are closed and the stationery section in the supermarkets are shut down\n\nThe Minister of Education recently announced that classes will continue to remain online when school reopens on June 13 and 14. But many parents who want to repair their laptops and handphones used by their children for online learning at home cannot do so because all of these services are shut down during the full MCO.\n\nEven stationery sections of some supermarkets have been shut down, preventing parents from even buying stationery for their children to use at home.\n\n12) We don\u2019t know how people are supposed to Work From Home (WFH) if their laptops break down and their phones are damaged but IT and handphone shops are closed\n\nSimilarly, for those who have to work from home using their laptops and handphones, they better hope their devices don\u2019t break down during the full MCO since none of the places which repair these devices are open.\n\n(I had a problem with my laptop which could only be fixed at the HQ of the company and I was informed that this could only be done after the end of the full MCO. Thankfully I have the resources to buy a new laptop but what about those who don\u2019t have the funds to buy a laptop during such an emergency?)\n\n13) We don\u2019t know how those people who seek treatments from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) can continue to seek such treatments\n\nI was also told that those seeking treatments from TCM shops cannot do so during the full MCO. The operators of the TCM shops cannot even go to their shops to pack packages of herbs to send to their customers as they are not considered an essential service even though they provide health and other related relief to their customers.\n\n14) We don\u2019t know why hair colouring is not allowed to be sold at pharmacies\n\nApparently, some pharmacies sealed up the section of their stores selling hair colouring as it is deemed as a non-essential item. I cannot understand why the selling of hair colouring at a pharmacy that is already open can be detrimental to our overall fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n15) We don\u2019t know why the home improvement section in some shops e.g. Mr DIY are not allowed to be opened\n\nApparently, some sections of hardware shops that sell home improvement products have been cordoned off. I received a report via a tweet that a person couldn\u2019t buy \u201chooks\u201d for his bathroom from Mr DIY because this section had been cordoned off.\n\n16) We don\u2019t know how people are going to cook at home if some of their home appliances break down since electrical appliance stores are not opened and the sections selling some of these items in supermarkets are closed (e.g. rice cookers and kettles)\n\nHousehold appliances such as rice cookers and kettles have their shelf life. Some may short circuit during the full MCO because of overuse. But we may not be able to buy their replacements because those shops selling electrical appliances are not open and the sections selling some of these items in some supermarkets have been cordoned off.\n\nOf course, there is the option of buying these items online but delivery may take a few days and for some of the semi-urban areas, the preferred option would still be to go to the physical store to procure these items.\n\n17) We don\u2019t know how companies that are in non-essential sectors can continue to maintain their data centres in case of emergencies\n\nI know of a company that is in the non-essential sector but has an important data centre that stores and processes critical information to the financial services sector. For these companies, they need to have one or two people on standby to access the data center in case there is an emergency or if the server breaks down (for whatever reason).\n\nIs MDEC, the agency under the Ministry of Multimedia and Communications, that is in charge of data centre operations, aware of such issues happening?\n\n18) We cannot understand why some companies were issued letters of approval by Miti but when the QR code for the company is scanned by the police, the details reveal that it is considered as a non-essential industry\n\nThis is a bit of a technical issue but is important in terms of preventing companies and their staff from being unfairly fined. Some companies which are listed as essential services suddenly find that they are not classified as an essential service when the QR code on their Miti letter is scanned by the authorities including the police.\n\nThis means that the employees of companies with this sort of letter can potentially be fined thousands of ringgit for violating the full MCO. The photos above show information from an optometrist which is not classified as essential under the QR code scan even though a letter from Miti has been issued to allow this optometrist to continue to operate under the full MCO.\n\n19) We still don\u2019t understand why jogging is allowed but cycling is banned\n\nI appreciate the fact that jogging and exercising alone in our residential areas are still permitted. But I fail to understand why cycling alone is not permitted, especially if this person is cycling within a 10km radius of his or her home.\n\nFurthermore, some people actually cycle to work (including some factory workers in my constituency) and some people cycle to the morning market to do their grocery shopping. Will they be fined for cycling by the enforcement authorities?\n\n20) We still haven\u2019t heard the following ministers come together and separately give a press briefing on the sectors under their jurisdiction - Miti, Home Ministry, Domestic Trade, Communications and Multimedia, Housing and Local Government (just to name a few)\n\nI am not sure if a gag order has been issued by the prime minister to disallow ministers other than Ismail Sabri to have press briefings for the full MCO. But given the current confusion over the SOPs, shouldn\u2019t the ministers from the key ministries (as suggested above) organise a joint press conference to clear the air? We wait with bated breath for this to happen.\n\nONG KIAN MING is the DAP MP for Bangi and a former deputy minister of international trade and industry.", "keyword": ["sops", "lockdown", "dont",

agreed to be included in the Economic Frontliners Vaccination Programme (retail sector) and have employees at their outlets get vaccinated.\n\nShopping centres are currently applying to Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) to host vaccination centres (PPV) on their premises so retailers can sign up for on-site vaccination.\n\nCentral i-City Shopping Centre chief operating officer Anthony Dylan said 65% of its tenants supported the initiative.\n\n\u201cWe are hoping at least 70% of the mall\u2019s tenants will register with us as we play our part in achieving herd immunity as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cWe are proposing one floor of the carpark to be designated as a vaccination centre, with drive-through function.\n\n\u201cThe location is an alternative to event halls and large-scale venues to get the vaccination done.\n\n\u201cIt is conducive with natural ventilation, proper ingress and egress ramps for drive-through as well as as a suitable location nearby to store the vaccine in accordance with government requirements.\u201d\n\nCapitaLand, which manages seven malls namely 3 Damansara, Melawati Mall, The Mines and Sungei Wang Plaza in Klang Valley, Gurney Plaza as well as Queensbay Mall in Penang and East Coast Mall in Kuantan (Pahang), had also written to the authorities to consider using three of its malls as vaccination centres.\n\n\u201cWe are awaiting further clarifications from the authorities on costs and operational requirements.\n\n\u201cWe have communicated with our tenants to take part in this programme, \u201d said CapitaLand Malaysia Retail head Eddie Lim.\n\n\n\nLim: Over 80% of tenants at malls managed by CapitaLand want to sign up for the vaccination programme for retail frontliners.\n\n\u201cMore than 80% of our tenants are interested to sign up for the vaccination programme for retail frontliners.\n\n\u201cAs our malls remain open during this period, the vaccination exercise will help protect the health and well-being of our shoppers, tenants and staff.\n\n\u201cOur aim is to help the government look at different ideas for decentralisation and expedite the whole vaccination process, \u201d he said.\n\nSunway Malls and Theme Parks chief executive officer HC Chan said Sunway Malls planned to join the PPV drive rolled out by the government.\n\n\u201cThis is still in the early stages and we applaud the government\u2019s efforts to speed up vaccination by opening multiple channels across public and private sectors.\n\n\u201cThe road to recovery hinges on how fast and how wide the vaccination reaches the population.\n\n\u201cSunway had rolled out the first private large-scale vaccination centre for frontliners and the general population in Petaling district since March 2021 at Sunway Pyramid Convention Centre.\n\n\u201cSunway Malls has a staff strength of 12,000.\n\n\u201cThese retail frontliners, especially those in the essential sectors such as supermarket, convenience stores, food and beverage operators as well as pharmacies are in contact with the public daily, thus it is important that they get vaccinated as soon as possible to protect themselves and visitors.\n\n\n\nChan: Sunway Malls and Theme Parks\u2019 ultimate aim is to work with the government to achieve herd immunity as fast as possible.\n\n\u201cOur ultimate aim is to work closely with the government to achieve herd immunity as fast as possible, \u201d he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Bangsar Village 2 could be used as a vaccination centre for workers in the Telawi commercial area.Eng Lian Enterprise Sdn Bhd, which manages Bangsar Village 1,2 and 3 apart from some commercial lots in the area, has offered space for a vaccination centre.\n\nIts leasing manager Vincent Siow said the company had identified a vacant lot on the third floor of Bangsar Village 2 to be used for a vaccination exercise.\n\nNot only would it benefit its retailers\u2019 staff, he said the management had also proposed to include workers in the Telawi commercial centre.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to work with the Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) and KPDNHEP to propose Bangsar Village 2 as a vaccination centre to speed up the national vaccination programme.\n\n\u201cThe response from retailers has been encouraging.\n\n\u201cIf all goes well, we expect about 4,000 workers to receive their vaccination here, \u201d he said.\n\nSuria KLCC in Kuala Lumpur is another mall offering to be a vaccination centre.\n\nSuria KLCC Sdn Bhd, which manages the mall, issued a letter to its retailers on May 31 to submit names of employees interested to be inoculated at the premises by June 1.\n\nThe letter stated that the vaccination exercise will begin sometime this month.\n\n\n\nMost of the tenants at Sunway Pyramid in Petaling Jaya are eager to get their staff vaccinated under the Economic Frontliners Vaccination Programme (retail sector). \u2014 FAIHAN GHANI/The Star\n\nThe tenants that StarMetro spoke to at various malls said they were supportive of the vaccination initiative despite a nominal fee being charged to tenants.\n\nCaring Pharmacy senior pharmacy practice executive Ng Yi Ling said the company was supportive of the programme for shopping centres to be vaccination centres for their retailers.\n\n\u201cOur staff at Caring outlets nationwide are retail frontliners who deal with a huge number of customers, so they are exposed to a certain level of risk during this Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cVaccination for our staff is the best way to protect themselves and at the same time, boosts customer confidence when patronising our stores.\n\n\u201cIt is also geared towards achieving herd immunity the soonest possible.\n\n\u201cCaring encourages all our staff to be vaccinated once the request to set up a vaccination centre in malls is approved by the government, \u201d she told StarMetro.The pharmacy currently has 144 outlets nationwide with more than 1,100 staff, including pharmacists.\n\nNg opined that a small fee charged to tenants in order to get their workers vaccinated was reasonable.\n\n\u201cThe company is willing to chip in as part of its responsibility to get as many employees as we can vaccinated, \u201d she said.\n\n\n\nBangsar Village 2 management has offered to use a vacant lot on its third floor as a vaccination centre not only for mall staff but also for workers in the Telawi commercial area.\n\nDin Tai Fung Malaysia business development director Jeffrey Lim said all its restaurant employees, excluding pregnant women and those with allergies, were supportive of the programme and wanted to get vaccinated as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cOur 11 restaurants nationwide serve customers on a daily basis and we are very heartened to be considered as frontliners.\n\n\u201cWe believe that we can do our part in flattening the curve by getting vaccinated.\n\n\u201cThe company is also bearing the costs for our employees to ensure their safety, \u201d he said.\n\nTGV Cinemas sales and marketing general manager Mohit Bhargava said the company was fully supportive of the initiative.\n\n\u201cWe have enlisted our staff as part of the vaccination programme being rolled out at the shopping centres where we are tenants.\n\n\u201cIt is a collective effort to achieve herd immunity and definitely our frontline staff\u2019s safety is our priority,

sold to consumers, including alcohol and cigarettes.\n\n\u201cIn the supermarket premises and hypermarkets, the sale of goods is limited to food and beverages/basic necessities, pharmacy/personal care stores and convenience stores/mini marts and restaurants (only for takeaway).\n\n\u201cJust like in convenience stores, liquors are also sold among other essentials in supermarket beverages section and therefore, it can be sold to consumers.

However, car wash services are not allowed.\n\n\u201cTherefore, allegation that the ministry is keeping mum on these issues is baseless.

Ministry (KPDNHEP) and the Finance Ministry have allocated RM600 million this year compared to last year\u2019s RM528 million for the Cooking Oil Stabilisation Scheme (COSS).\n\nKPDNHEP Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi said his ministry is in discussions with several other ministries and agencies related to improving the price implementation mechanism for subsidised and non-subsidised cooking oil in the market to reduce consumers\u2019 burden.\n\n\u201cThe government will inform the outcome of the discussions and the agreed mechanism,\u201d Nanta Linggi said in a statement.\n\nCOSS is a cooking oil subsidy programme aimed at alleviating consumers\u2019 cost of living, applicable to all groups.\n\nNanta Linggi said the subsidy is given to 1kg cooking oil packed in polybags and offered to consumers at RM2.50 per packet despite the price of crude palm oil (CPO) at the world market currently increasing.\n\n\u201cThe government has allocated 60,000 metric tonnes (MT) per month (or 720,000MT per year) which is equivalent to 60 million polybags per month (720 million polybags per year) for all Malaysians.\n\n\u201cThis is based on a consumption rate of 1.8kg per person per month (22kg per person per year),\u201d he said, adding that the government guarantees the quality of subsidised cooking oil sold in polybags are the same as those sold in bottles, as some are manufactured at the same factory.\n\nMeanwhile, cooking oil sold in plastic bottles and cans (2kg, 3kg, 5kg and 17kg) are not subsidised as the prices are determined by the CPO price at the world market.\n\n\u201cPeople have the choice to buy subsidised cooking oil in 1kg polybags or the unsubsidised ones in bottles and cans,\u201d the minister said.\n\nCurrently, the CPO price in the world market has reached more than RM4,500 per MT compared to around RM2,500 per MT before, which is equivalent to approximately RM4.50 per kg before being processed and bottled.\n\nThis means that CPO\u2019s cost alone, before packaged, is already more than RM22 for 5kg, excluding other costs such as processing, bottling, transportation and profits at all levels of factories, wholesalers, distributors and retailers.\n\nNanta Linggi said KPDNHEP enforcement is consistently monitoring the supply and price of goods in the market.\n\n\u201cThe enforcement will not hesitate to take action under the Price Control and Anti-Monitoring Act 2011 if it finds traders who are profiteering on the price of goods, including cooking oil,\u201d he said.\n\nKPDNHEP will exercise its powers such as enforcing controlled prices or ceiling prices.\n\nThe Festive Season Maximum Price Scheme is one example where the ministry enforced price controls for each festive season, where KPDNHEP anticipates

Section 21 of the Price Control and Anti-Profiteering Act 2011,\u201d KPDNHEP said in a statement yesterday.\n\nThe rise in cooking oil prices was caused by the increasing costs of major raw materials for cooking oil production such as crude palm oil which continues to increase since last year.\n\n\u201cTraders are reminded not to take advantage by profiteering as this will result in the instability of the price of essential goods in the market which will eventually be a burden to the people.\n\n\u201cStern action will be taken against those who profiteer,\u201d the ministry said.

would directly impact the public for their daily use of the commodity and also affect household and business spending.\n\n\u201cThe price must be controlled as it will affect the country\u2019s

will lead to other problems such as traders raising their food prices,\u201d he told Bernama.\n\nHe was commenting on the price increase on the two-kilogramme (kg) and five-kg bottled cooking oil

over RM4,300 per tonne compared to around RN2,500 previously, equivalent to about RM4.30 per kg before being processed and bottled.\n\nThis means the cost of crude palm oil has exceeded RM21 for 5 kg, without taking into account the other costs such as bottling, transportation and profit at the factory, wholesaler, distributor and retailer levels.\n\nHowever, Shazali said seeing Malaysia as among the largest producers of palm oil in the world, it was illogical if local consumers were forced to bear the burden of its price increase in the global market.\n\nHe suggested that KPDNHEP use the controlled float system for the price of bottled palm oil as had been done to decide the prices of petrol and diesel.\n\nBut one maximum price must be set although it was not a subsidised item, as a long-term solution, he said.\n\nHe also suggested that the government implement the windfall tax on palm oil producing companies which reaped huge profits from the current hike in the price of crude palm oil globally. \u2014 Bernama", "keyword": ["increase", "fix", "oil", "ceiling", "hike", "price", "avoid", "subsidised", "excessive", "crude", "world", "palm", "bottled", "cooking", "kg"],

additional costs of on-site Covid-19 vaccination programmes, including paying government-owned ProtectHealth Corporation, except the cost of vaccines itself that are provided free by the government.\n\nKUALA LUMPUR, June 9 \u2014 The Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) will set a ceiling price on vaccine administration charges under the Covid-19 inoculation programme for industries that use vaccines provided for free from the government.\n\nVaccine Minister Khairy Jamaluddin said today that CITF is working with various ministries, including the International Trade and Industry Ministry (MITI), Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP), Ministry of Tourism, Arts & Culture (MOTAC), Ministry of Works (KKR), and other government agencies to inoculate economic frontliners in the country.\n\nAt the same time, Khairy, who acknowledged a wide range of charges that are being imposed by companies and industries for vaccine administration costs, said that CITF will set a ceiling price for those charges.\n\n\u201cSo CITF is working together with the relevant agencies to set a schedule of fair and reasonable charges that will be borne by industries and companies that participate in the PPV (public-private vaccination) industrial programme,\u201d Khairy said in a joint press conference today with Health Minister Dr Adham Baba.\n\n\u201cThis is above and beyond the charges paid to ProtectHealth to cover the private health care organisers. This includes the hall rental and all the logistics that are necessary.\u201d\n\nEarlier, CodeBlue reported that the shopping malls are paying to the Ministry of Health (MOH)-owned ProtectHealth Corporation for on-site vaccination programmes.\n\nThe Malaysia Shopping Malls Association (PPK) said that from the total of RM50 fee per person for two doses at on-site vaccination in malls, RM30 would go to ProtectHealth. However, ProtectHealth denied collecting payments from shopping centres purportedly rolling out Covid-19 inoculation drives with vaccinators from ProtectHealth.\n\nBut Khairy today said that the industries will absorb other additional costs of on-site vaccination programmes, except the cost of vaccines itself that will be supplied to industries at no cost from the government\u2019s National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme (PICK).\n\n\u201cSecondly, the industries will bear the cost of administering the vaccination. That will include the payment made to the health care organisations that are organised via ProtectHealth Corporation, which is a fully owned company of MOH,\u201d Khairy said.\n\n\u201cNow the other charges for rental of premises and other services \u2014 this is where there are inconsistencies in terms of the additional charges.\u201d\n\nKhairy also announced that the industrial Covid-19 vaccination programme will start on June 16 in Pengerang, Johor, for workers in oil and gas company Petronas.\n\n\u201cWe have identified the Pengerang Complex as a high-risk area and we will be starting our PPV industries for employees in Petronas complex in Pengerang on 16th of June and the others to follow.\u201d\n\nUnlike the industrial Covid-19 vaccination programme, the Malaysian government has been covering the cost of administering vaccines, as the government-owned ProtectHealth pays private medical practitioners RM14 per dose for their inoculation services under PICK that has also utilised private health care facilities as vaccination centres. Both the industrial inoculation drive and PICK use vaccines supplied from the government.\n\nRecently, the government of India announced that private hospitals in the country will only be allowed to charge a maximum \u201cservice charge\u201d of 150 rupees (RM8.49) per dose in a fixed price of the jabs.\n\nThe Indian government said that it will provide Covid-19 vaccinations for free to all adults aged 18 and older from June 21, reversing an earlier decision that allowed states to procure their own vaccine supplies to vaccinate those aged between 18 and 44.\n\nKhairy also said today that the economic frontliners\u2019 vaccination programme will include a wide range of industries in order to pave the way for them to continue operating during movement control orders (MCO) in the country.\n\n\u201cThe arrangement or the discussions that we have been having with various industries, whether they are manufacturing, construction, retail, hospitality, is that if they would like to facilitate the vaccination of their employees, seeing some of these industries operate during the MCOs, we can proceed on a public-private partnership.\u201d", "keyword": ["fix", "vaccination", "ceiling", "khairy", "vaccines", "price", "cost", "industries", "protecthealth", "ministry", "programmes", "covid19", "health", "citf", "programme", "industrial"], "summary": "Khairy Jamaluddin says industries will absorb all additional costs of on-site Covid-19 vaccination programmes, including paying government-owned ProtectHealth Corporation, except the cost of vaccines itself that are provided free by the government.\nKUALA LUMPUR, June 9 \u2014 The Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) will set a ceiling price on vaccine administration charges under the Covid-19 inoculation programme for industries that use vaccines provided for free from the government.\nThis includes the hall rental and all the logistics that are necessary.\u201dEarlier, CodeBlue reported that the shopping malls are paying to the Ministry of Health (MOH)-owned ProtectHealth Corporation for on-site vaccination programmes.\nHowever, ProtectHealth denied collecting payments from shopping centres purportedly rolling out Covid-19 inoculation drives with vaccinators from ProtectHealth.\n\u201cNow the other charges for rental of premises and other services \u2014 this is where there are inconsistencies in terms of the additional charges.\u201dKhairy also announced that the industrial Covid-19 vaccination programme will start on June 16 in Pengerang, Johor, for workers in oil and gas company Petronas.", "news": "CodeBlue", "date": "2021-06-09 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Did MDCC President Catch MITI In A Gaffe?", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wNi8xMi9kaWQtbWRjYy1wcmVzaWRlbnQtY2F0Y2gtbWl0aS1pbi1hLWdhZmZlL9IBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wNi8xMi9kaWQtbWRjYy1wcmVzaWRlbnQtY2F0Y2gtbWl0aS1pbi1hLWdhZmZlL2FtcC8?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Azizul Rahman Ismail", "Maya Suraya"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dyana-wing-so-PAfM5FQ1Drk-unsplash.jpg", "text": "Subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates.\n\nIt began with a Twitter post by Malaysia Digital Chamber of Commerce (MDCC) president, Chris Daniel Wong, of a letter of permission by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI).

Since the 'total lockdown' or full MCO started on June 1, almost a week ago, there has been more confusion and questions now compared to the first MCO. Here is a list of issues I compiled based on media reports and social media postings over the past week.\n\n20 issues we are still unsure about a week into the full MCO:\n\n1) We still don\u2019t have a comprehensive list of which sectors or industries are under the jurisdiction of which ministry.\n\nWhen the full MCO was announced, I issued a statement asking the PN government to make public a comprehensive list of the different sectors of the economy and which ministries are responsible for overseeing them. This list has not been published.\n\nWe need to know this information even though the issuing of approval letters has gone back to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti)'s Cims 3.0 system. This is because the approvals still have to come from the respective ministries and there is still confusion among the ministries themselves as to which sectors they are responsible for.\n\n2) We still don\u2019t know if restaurants are allowed to operate if they have not gotten an approval letter from Miti\n\nOne example is restaurants. Although food and beverages (F&B) are considered essential items and F&B is considered an essential industry, it is unclear which ministry is responsible for approving the continued operations of the many thousands of restaurants in the entire country.\n\nThe Ministry of Housing and Local Government (KPKT) has said that hawkers only need to produce their license from the local authority to operate and will not have to wait for the Miti letter to continue to operate. But this has not stopped some irresponsible enforcement officers from pressuring hawkers into showing their Miti letter.\n\nSome restaurants continue to remain closed even for takeaway meals because they have not gotten their Miti approval letter yet. I have received some reports that the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) thinks that only franchise restaurants come under its purview but not the non-franchise restaurants. The National Security Council (NSC) has not clarified this issue at the time of writing.\n\n3) We don\u2019t know if those operating roadside stalls selling food and drinks can continue to operate without an approval letter from Miti\n\nThis is similar to the point above except that some of these stalls don\u2019t operate with a valid license from the local authority. But how about those who have been given a temporary license to operate by the local authorities in KL and Selangor, for example, during the Covid-19 pandemic? Can they continue to operate? Are the enforcement officers clear on this policy?\n\n4) We don\u2019t know what criteria was used to ban the sale of alcohol but allow the sale of cigarettes\n\nThe Deputy Minister of Trade and Consumer Affairs was reported to have said that the sale of alcohol was banned because it is considered as a non-essential item but the sale of cigarettes would continue to be allowed to cater for the \u201ccigarette addicts\u201d.\n\nLater on, Senior Minister (Security) Ismail Sabri Yaakob expressed his confusion over this statement since shops that sell beer such as 7-11 were still being allowed to operate. Some supermarkets then closed down the section of their operations selling beer and other alcoholic beverages to comply with the \u2018instruction\u2019 from the deputy minister. The Minister of Domestic Trade has not issued any public statement on this issue, as far as I know.\n\nI am not advocating for a ban on cigarettes. What I am asking, like many other Malaysians, is consistency and clarity in government policies on the part of the government.\n\nIf the production and sale of alcohol are banned during the full MCO, has the government considered that opportunists will take the opportunity to make and sell illegal alcohol which will be much more dangerous to consumers? Or have we forgotten the deaths of those through methanol poisoning by consuming cheap and illegal alcohol back in 2019?\n\n5) We still don\u2019t know if automotive/car workshops are allowed to operate if they have not gotten an approval letter from Miti\n\nEven though car workshops are listed as essential under the distributive trade category, it is still unclear which is the ministry that is supposed to give approval for these workshops to continue to operate.\n\nThe Ministry of Transport does not list auto workshops under the sectors that are under its jurisdiction for approval in its Smile application system. The Ministry of Domestic Trade is maintaining an elegant silence on this issue.\n\nSo many car workshops continue to remain closed. This means that those in the logistics sector needing servicing may face some challenges. And those who need to drive to work because they are working in the essential services sector must hope and pray their cars or motorcycles don\u2019t break down or require major servicing.\n\n6) We don\u2019t know if those who are in the distributive trade sector and supplying the essential services are allowed to operate and from which ministry do they seek approval from\n\nI know of someone who imports various types of PPE equipment to supply to the hospitals and Covid-19 quarantine centres in Malaysia. Without getting approval to operate, his company would not have been able to continue the supply of these essential items to the Ministry of Health.\n\nHe tried applying to the Ministry of Domestic Trade but the website and later, the Google form application, crashed. After trying various options, I was made to understand that his approval was finally granted. I am still unsure as to which was the approving ministry for his particular sector of the economy.\n\n7) We don\u2019t know if air-con maintenance and repair are allowed to operate and from which ministry they should seek approval to operate from\n\nCritical maintenance and repair are listed as one of the 17 essential services during the full MCO but I think it only applies to the construction sector. What about other maintenance and service operations that are critical for the continued operations of other essential sectors?\n\nFor example, if the air-conditioning system at a hospital breaks down, we need those in the air-conditioning service sector to do their repair work. For factories producing food and beverages, they also need their air circulation system to be maintained.\n\nIn fact, one can say that given the airborne nature of the Covid-10 virus, the air-conditioning sector should be considered as essential especially for the servicing of commercial (including factories) and government buildings. We are also unsure which ministry the air-con sector comes under.\n\n8) We don\u2019t know if plumbers are allowed to operate and from which ministry they should seek approval to operate from\n\nPlumbers are also important to ensure that the toilets in hospitals, factories, offices, and government buildings are \u201cflowing\u201d smoothly. But which ministry is in charge of approving plumbers to continue to operate under full MCO?\n\n9) We don\u2019t know if those servicing photocopiers and printers are allowed to operate and from which ministry they need to seek approval from\n\nI also received a request from a company whose sales and marketing arm services the photocopiers and provides printing paper to many government ministries and agencies including the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Finance.\n\nIf such companies are not allowed to operate, the ministries and even hospitals, may not have the required paper to print their documents on and also would not be able to have access to photocopiers and printers which have broken down and are being left unrepaired during the full MCO.\n\n10) We don\u2019t know what criteria are being used to approve or not to approve those who are in the essential services supply chain\n\nThere should have been a clear mapping and understanding of the sectors and companies which are critical to the continued operations of the essential services sectors. This can be used as the basis of approving, not approving, or approving at a much-reduced capacity, companies that are part of this supply chain.\n\nAs of today, we have not seen such a mapping or heard any explanations from any minister with regard to the bigger picture surrounding the supply chain for essential services.\n\n11) We don\u2019t know how children are going to learn online when computer and telco shops are closed and the stationery section in the supermarkets are shut down\n\nThe Minister of Education recently announced that classes will continue to remain online when school reopens on June 13 and 14. But many parents who want to repair their laptops and handphones used by their children for online learning at home cannot do so because all of these services are shut down during the full MCO.\n\nEven stationery sections of some supermarkets have been shut down, preventing parents from even buying stationery for their children to use at home.\n\n12) We don\u2019t know how people are supposed to Work From Home (WFH) if their laptops break down and their phones are damaged but IT and handphone shops are closed\n\nSimilarly, for those who have to work from home using their laptops and handphones, they better hope their devices don\u2019t break down during the full MCO since none of the places which repair these devices are open.\n\n(I had a problem with my laptop which could only be fixed at the HQ of the company and I was informed that this could only be done after the end of the full MCO. Thankfully I have the resources to buy a new laptop but what about those who don\u2019t have the funds to buy a laptop during such an emergency?)\n\n13) We don\u2019t know how those people who seek treatments from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) can continue to seek such treatments\n\nI was also told that those seeking treatments from TCM shops cannot do so during the full MCO. The operators of the TCM shops cannot even go to their shops to pack packages of herbs to send to their customers as they are not considered an essential service even though they provide health and other related relief to their customers.\n\n14) We don\u2019t know why hair colouring is not allowed to be sold at pharmacies\n\nApparently, some pharmacies sealed up the section of their stores selling hair colouring as it is deemed as a non-essential item. I cannot understand why the selling of hair colouring at a pharmacy that is already open can be detrimental to our overall fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n15) We don\u2019t know why the home improvement section in some shops e.g. Mr DIY are not allowed to be opened\n\nApparently, some sections of hardware shops that sell home improvement products have been cordoned off. I received a report via a tweet that a person couldn\u2019t buy \u201chooks\u201d for his bathroom from Mr DIY because this section had been cordoned off.\n\n16) We don\u2019t know how people are going to cook at home if some of their home appliances break down since electrical appliance stores are not opened and the sections selling some of these items in supermarkets are closed (e.g. rice cookers and kettles)\n\nHousehold appliances such as rice cookers and kettles have their shelf life. Some may short circuit during the full MCO because of overuse. But we may not be able to buy their replacements because those shops selling electrical appliances are not open and the sections selling some of these items in some supermarkets have been cordoned off.\n\nOf course, there is the option of buying these items online but delivery may take a few days and for some of the semi-urban areas, the preferred option would still be to go to the physical store to procure these items.\n\n17) We don\u2019t know how companies that are in non-essential sectors can continue to maintain their data centres in case of emergencies\n\nI know of a company that is in the non-essential sector but has an important data centre that stores and processes critical information to the financial services sector. For these companies, they need to have one or two people on standby to access the data center in case there is an emergency or if the server breaks down (for whatever reason).\n\nIs MDEC, the agency under the Ministry of Multimedia and Communications, that is in charge of data centre operations, aware of such issues happening?\n\n18) We cannot understand why some companies were issued letters of approval by Miti but when the QR code for the company is scanned by the police, the details reveal that it is considered as a non-essential industry\n\nThis is a bit of a technical issue but is important in terms of preventing companies and their staff from being unfairly fined. Some companies which are listed as essential services suddenly find that they are not classified as an essential service when the QR code on their Miti letter is scanned by the authorities including the police.\n\nThis means that the employees of companies with this sort of letter can potentially be fined thousands of ringgit for violating the full MCO. The photos above show information from an optometrist which is not classified as essential under the QR code scan even though a letter from Miti has been issued to allow this optometrist to continue to operate under the full MCO.\n\n19) We still don\u2019t understand why jogging is allowed but cycling is banned\n\nI appreciate the fact that jogging and exercising alone in our residential areas are still permitted. But I fail to understand why cycling alone is not permitted, especially if this person is cycling within a 10km radius of his or her home.\n\nFurthermore, some people actually cycle to work (including some factory workers in my constituency) and some people cycle to the morning market to do their grocery shopping. Will they be fined for cycling by the enforcement authorities?\n\n20) We still haven\u2019t heard the following ministers come together and separately give a press briefing on the sectors under their jurisdiction - Miti, Home Ministry, Domestic Trade, Communications and Multimedia, Housing and Local Government (just to name a few)\n\nI am not sure if a gag order has been issued by the prime minister to disallow ministers other than Ismail Sabri to have press briefings for the full MCO. But given the current confusion over the SOPs, shouldn\u2019t the ministers from the key ministries (as suggested above) organise a joint press conference to clear the air? We wait with bated breath for this to happen.\n\nONG KIAN MING is the DAP MP for Bangi and a former deputy minister of international trade and industry.", "keyword": ["sops", "lockdown", "dont",

agreed to be included in the Economic Frontliners Vaccination Programme (retail sector) and have employees at their outlets get vaccinated.\n\nShopping centres are currently applying to Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) to host vaccination centres (PPV) on their premises so retailers can sign up for on-site vaccination.\n\nCentral i-City Shopping Centre chief operating officer Anthony Dylan said 65% of its tenants supported the initiative.\n\n\u201cWe are hoping at least 70% of the mall\u2019s tenants will register with us as we play our part in achieving herd immunity as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cWe are proposing one floor of the carpark to be designated as a vaccination centre, with drive-through function.\n\n\u201cThe location is an alternative to event halls and large-scale venues to get the vaccination done.\n\n\u201cIt is conducive with natural ventilation, proper ingress and egress ramps for drive-through as well as as a suitable location nearby to store the vaccine in accordance with government requirements.\u201d\n\nCapitaLand, which manages seven malls namely 3 Damansara, Melawati Mall, The Mines and Sungei Wang Plaza in Klang Valley, Gurney Plaza as well as Queensbay Mall in Penang and East Coast Mall in Kuantan (Pahang), had also written to the authorities to consider using three of its malls as vaccination centres.\n\n\u201cWe are awaiting further clarifications from the authorities on costs and operational requirements.\n\n\u201cWe have communicated with our tenants to take part in this programme, \u201d said CapitaLand Malaysia Retail head Eddie Lim.\n\n\n\nLim: Over 80% of tenants at malls managed by CapitaLand want to sign up for the vaccination programme for retail frontliners.\n\n\u201cMore than 80% of our tenants are interested to sign up for the vaccination programme for retail frontliners.\n\n\u201cAs our malls remain open during this period, the vaccination exercise will help protect the health and well-being of our shoppers, tenants and staff.\n\n\u201cOur aim is to help the government look at different ideas for decentralisation and expedite the whole vaccination process, \u201d he said.\n\nSunway Malls and Theme Parks chief executive officer HC Chan said Sunway Malls planned to join the PPV drive rolled out by the government.\n\n\u201cThis is still in the early stages and we applaud the government\u2019s efforts to speed up vaccination by opening multiple channels across public and private sectors.\n\n\u201cThe road to recovery hinges on how fast and how wide the vaccination reaches the population.\n\n\u201cSunway had rolled out the first private large-scale vaccination centre for frontliners and the general population in Petaling district since March 2021 at Sunway Pyramid Convention Centre.\n\n\u201cSunway Malls has a staff strength of 12,000.\n\n\u201cThese retail frontliners, especially those in the essential sectors such as supermarket, convenience stores, food and beverage operators as well as pharmacies are in contact with the public daily, thus it is important that they get vaccinated as soon as possible to protect themselves and visitors.\n\n\n\nChan: Sunway Malls and Theme Parks\u2019 ultimate aim is to work with the government to achieve herd immunity as fast as possible.\n\n\u201cOur ultimate aim is to work closely with the government to achieve herd immunity as fast as possible, \u201d he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Bangsar Village 2 could be used as a vaccination centre for workers in the Telawi commercial area.Eng Lian Enterprise Sdn Bhd, which manages Bangsar Village 1,2 and 3 apart from some commercial lots in the area, has offered space for a vaccination centre.\n\nIts leasing manager Vincent Siow said the company had identified a vacant lot on the third floor of Bangsar Village 2 to be used for a vaccination exercise.\n\nNot only would it benefit its retailers\u2019 staff, he said the management had also proposed to include workers in the Telawi commercial centre.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to work with the Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) and KPDNHEP to propose Bangsar Village 2 as a vaccination centre to speed up the national vaccination programme.\n\n\u201cThe response from retailers has been encouraging.\n\n\u201cIf all goes well, we expect about 4,000 workers to receive their vaccination here, \u201d he said.\n\nSuria KLCC in Kuala Lumpur is another mall offering to be a vaccination centre.\n\nSuria KLCC Sdn Bhd, which manages the mall, issued a letter to its retailers on May 31 to submit names of employees interested to be inoculated at the premises by June 1.\n\nThe letter stated that the vaccination exercise will begin sometime this month.\n\n\n\nMost of the tenants at Sunway Pyramid in Petaling Jaya are eager to get their staff vaccinated under the Economic Frontliners Vaccination Programme (retail sector). \u2014 FAIHAN GHANI/The Star\n\nThe tenants that StarMetro spoke to at various malls said they were supportive of the vaccination initiative despite a nominal fee being charged to tenants.\n\nCaring Pharmacy senior pharmacy practice executive Ng Yi Ling said the company was supportive of the programme for shopping centres to be vaccination centres for their retailers.\n\n\u201cOur staff at Caring outlets nationwide are retail frontliners who deal with a huge number of customers, so they are exposed to a certain level of risk during this Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cVaccination for our staff is the best way to protect themselves and at the same time, boosts customer confidence when patronising our stores.\n\n\u201cIt is also geared towards achieving herd immunity the soonest possible.\n\n\u201cCaring encourages all our staff to be vaccinated once the request to set up a vaccination centre in malls is approved by the government, \u201d she told StarMetro.The pharmacy currently has 144 outlets nationwide with more than 1,100 staff, including pharmacists.\n\nNg opined that a small fee charged to tenants in order to get their workers vaccinated was reasonable.\n\n\u201cThe company is willing to chip in as part of its responsibility to get as many employees as we can vaccinated, \u201d she said.\n\n\n\nBangsar Village 2 management has offered to use a vacant lot on its third floor as a vaccination centre not only for mall staff but also for workers in the Telawi commercial area.\n\nDin Tai Fung Malaysia business development director Jeffrey Lim said all its restaurant employees, excluding pregnant women and those with allergies, were supportive of the programme and wanted to get vaccinated as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cOur 11 restaurants nationwide serve customers on a daily basis and we are very heartened to be considered as frontliners.\n\n\u201cWe believe that we can do our part in flattening the curve by getting vaccinated.\n\n\u201cThe company is also bearing the costs for our employees to ensure their safety, \u201d he said.\n\nTGV Cinemas sales and marketing general manager Mohit Bhargava said the company was fully supportive of the initiative.\n\n\u201cWe have enlisted our staff as part of the vaccination programme being rolled out at the shopping centres where we are tenants.\n\n\u201cIt is a collective effort to achieve herd immunity and definitely our frontline staff\u2019s safety is our priority,

said the list of essential services that have been authorised to operate had been clearly stated in his official statement issued on May 31.\n\n\u201cIn the list provided, it has been explained that convenience stores or mini markets and grocery stores are categorised as essential and given permission to operate \u2013 it simply means that all items in these convenience stores, therefore, can be

However, car wash services are not allowed.\n\n\u201cTherefore, allegation that the ministry is keeping mum on these issues is baseless.

Ministry (KPDNHEP) and the Finance Ministry have allocated RM600 million this year compared to last year\u2019s RM528 million for the Cooking Oil Stabilisation Scheme (COSS).\n\nKPDNHEP Minister Datuk

cooking oil in the market to reduce consumers\u2019 burden.\n\n\u201cThe government will inform the outcome of the discussions and the agreed mechanism,\u201d Nanta Linggi said in a statement.\n\nCOSS is a cooking oil subsidy programme aimed at alleviating consumers\u2019 cost of living, applicable to all groups.\n\nNanta Linggi said the subsidy is given to 1kg cooking oil packed in polybags and offered to consumers at RM2.50 per packet despite the price of crude palm oil (CPO) at the world market currently increasing.\n\n\u201cThe government has allocated 60,000 metric tonnes (MT) per month (or 720,000MT per year) which is equivalent to 60 million polybags per month (720 million polybags per year) for all Malaysians.\n\n\u201cThis is based on a consumption rate of 1.8kg per person per month (22kg per person per year),\u201d he said, adding that the government guarantees the quality of subsidised cooking oil sold in polybags are the same as those sold in bottles, as some are manufactured at the same factory.\n\nMeanwhile, cooking oil sold in plastic bottles and cans (2kg, 3kg, 5kg and 17kg) are not subsidised as the prices are determined by the CPO price at the world market.\n\n\u201cPeople have the choice to buy subsidised cooking oil in 1kg polybags or the unsubsidised ones in bottles and cans,\u201d the minister said.\n\nCurrently, the CPO price in the world market has reached more than RM4,500 per MT compared to around RM2,500 per MT before, which is equivalent to approximately RM4.50 per kg before being processed and bottled.\n\nThis means that CPO\u2019s cost alone, before packaged, is already more than RM22 for 5kg, excluding other costs such as processing, bottling, transportation and profits at all levels of factories, wholesalers, distributors and retailers.\n\nNanta Linggi said KPDNHEP enforcement is consistently monitoring the supply and price of goods in the market.\n\n\u201cThe enforcement will not hesitate to take action under the Price Control and Anti-Monitoring Act 2011 if it finds traders who are profiteering on the price of goods, including cooking oil,\u201d he said.\n\nKPDNHEP will exercise its powers such as enforcing controlled prices or ceiling prices.\n\nThe Festive Season Maximum Price Scheme is one example where the ministry enforced price controls for each festive season, where KPDNHEP anticipates

still being investigated.\n\n\u201cWe are still monitoring the price of cooking oil in the market to weed out uncontrolled price activities and ensure action taken against profiteering traders under Section 21 of the Price Control and Anti-Profiteering Act 2011,\u201d KPDNHEP said in a statement yesterday.\n\nThe rise in cooking oil prices was caused by the increasing costs of major raw materials for cooking oil production such as crude palm oil which continues to increase since last year.\n\n\u201cTraders are reminded not to take advantage by profiteering as this will result in the instability of the price of essential goods in the market which will eventually be a burden to the people.\n\n\u201cStern action will be taken against those who profiteer,\u201d the ministry said. KPDNHEP also clarified that the 1kg polybag cooking oil is of similar quality to those sold in bottles.\n\nThe ministry stressed that there is no issue of cooking oil sold in polybags are of poor quality or recycled oil, such as the views of certain parties.\n\nThe price of 1kg polybag cooking oil has been subsidised by the government which makes it lower compared to cooking oil sold in bottles.\n\n\u201cThe main goal is to ensure people can get the price of cooking oil for household use with a reasonable price of RM2.50 per 1kg polybag.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the packaging cost for the polybag is more economical,\u201d it added.\n\nKPDNHEP is conducting Ops Rantai 7.0 to monitor cooking oil prices in the market and profiteering activities among manufacturers and retailers.", "keyword": ["oil", "163", "controlled", "polybag", "prices", "price", "market", "profiteering", "kpdnhep", "items", "ministry", "sold", "cooking"], "summary": "The rise in cooking oil prices was caused by the increasing costs of major raw materials for cooking oil production such as crude palm oil which continues to increase since last year.\nKPDNHEP also clarified that the 1kg polybag cooking oil is of similar quality to those sold in bottles.\nThe ministry stressed that there is no issue of cooking oil sold in polybags are of poor quality or recycled oil, such as the views of certain parties.\nThe price of 1kg polybag cooking oil has been subsidised by the government which makes it lower compared to cooking oil sold in bottles.\nKPDNHEP is conducting Ops Rantai 7.0 to monitor cooking oil prices in the market and profiteering activities among manufacturers and retailers.", "news": "The Malaysian Reserve", "date": "2021-06-10 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Cooking oil: Govt to conduct study to determine ceiling price for 5kg bottles", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN1bmRhaWx5Lm15L2xvY2FsL2Nvb2tpbmctb2lsLWdvdnQtdG8tY29uZHVjdC1zdHVkeS10by1kZXRlcm1pbmUtY2VpbGluZy1wcmljZS1mb3ItNWtnLWJvdHRsZXMtSkw3OTYyOTY00gEA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://www.thesundaily.my/binrepository/480x305/0c9/480d250/none/11808/FXOY/datuk-rosol-wahid-cooking-oil-sop-check-bernama_1711670_20210612192211.jpg", "text": "SUNGAI BESAR: The government, through the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP), will conduct a study to set a ceiling price for 5kg bottled cooking oil based on the current market price.\n\nKPDNHEP Deputy Minister Datuk Rosol Wahid said his team would also discuss the recommended ceiling price with both the Plantation Industries and Commodities Ministry and Finance Ministry.\n\n\u201cMeetings will be held on how to overcome this problem (increase in cooking oil prices).\n\n\u201cWe will see the decision (adjustment of the ceiling price of cooking oil) in the meeting later,\u201c he told reporters after visiting and inspecting cooking oil supplies and compliance with standard operating procedures (SOP), here, today.\n\nHe said cooking oil had experienced a price hike due to an increase in the price of crude palm oil.\n\n\u201cI assure you that the government is working hard to ensure that people are not affected by the Covid-19 situation,\u201c he said.\n\nRosol also denied an opposition representative\u2019s claims that the 1kg oil subsidised by the government was recycled oil.\n\nHe also said that a total of 590,876 business premises, including petrol stations, restaurants, supermarkets and shopping malls, had been inspected to date.\n\n\u201cThere were 346 compounds issued on offenders who did not comply with the prescribed SOPs.

would directly impact the public for their daily use of the commodity and also affect household and business spending.\n\n\u201cThe price must be controlled as it will affect the country\u2019s

will lead to other problems such as traders raising their food prices,\u201d he told Bernama.\n\nHe was commenting on the price increase on the two-kilogramme (kg) and five-kg bottled cooking oil

over RM4,300 per tonne compared to around RN2,500 previously, equivalent to about RM4.30 per kg before being processed and bottled.\n\nThis means the cost of crude palm oil has exceeded RM21 for 5 kg, without taking into account the other costs such as bottling, transportation and profit at the factory, wholesaler, distributor and retailer levels.\n\nHowever, Shazali said seeing Malaysia as among the largest producers of palm oil in the world, it was illogical if local consumers were forced to bear the burden of its price increase in the global market.\n\nHe suggested that KPDNHEP use the controlled float system for the price of bottled palm oil as had been done to decide the prices of petrol and diesel.\n\nBut one maximum price must be set although it was not a subsidised item, as a long-term solution, he said.\n\nHe also suggested that the government implement the windfall tax on palm oil producing companies which reaped huge profits from the current hike in the price of crude palm oil globally. \u2014 Bernama", "keyword": ["increase", "fix", "oil", "ceiling", "hike", "price", "avoid", "subsidised", "excessive", "crude", "world", "palm", "bottled", "cooking", "kg"],

additional costs of on-site Covid-19 vaccination programmes, including paying government-owned ProtectHealth Corporation, except the cost of vaccines itself that are provided free by the government.\n\nKUALA LUMPUR, June 9 \u2014 The Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) will set a ceiling price on vaccine administration charges under the Covid-19 inoculation programme for industries that use vaccines provided for free from the government.\n\nVaccine Minister Khairy Jamaluddin said today that CITF is working with various ministries, including the International Trade and Industry Ministry (MITI), Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP), Ministry of Tourism, Arts & Culture (MOTAC), Ministry of Works (KKR), and other government agencies to inoculate economic frontliners in the country.\n\nAt the same time, Khairy, who acknowledged a wide range of charges that are being imposed by companies and industries for vaccine administration costs, said that CITF will set a ceiling price for those charges.\n\n\u201cSo CITF is working together with the relevant agencies to set a schedule of fair and reasonable charges that will be borne by industries and companies that participate in the PPV (public-private vaccination) industrial programme,\u201d Khairy said in a joint press conference today with Health Minister Dr Adham Baba.\n\n\u201cThis is above and beyond the charges paid to ProtectHealth to cover the private health care organisers. This includes the hall rental and all the logistics that are necessary.\u201d\n\nEarlier, CodeBlue reported that the shopping malls are paying to the Ministry of Health (MOH)-owned ProtectHealth Corporation for on-site vaccination programmes.\n\nThe Malaysia Shopping Malls Association (PPK) said that from the total of RM50 fee per person for two doses at on-site vaccination in malls, RM30 would go to ProtectHealth. However, ProtectHealth denied collecting payments from shopping centres purportedly rolling out Covid-19 inoculation drives with vaccinators from ProtectHealth.\n\nBut Khairy today said that the industries will absorb other additional costs of on-site vaccination programmes, except the cost of vaccines itself that will be supplied to industries at no cost from the government\u2019s National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme (PICK).\n\n\u201cSecondly, the industries will bear the cost of administering the vaccination. That will include the payment made to the health care organisations that are organised via ProtectHealth Corporation, which is a fully owned company of MOH,\u201d Khairy said.\n\n\u201cNow the other charges for rental of premises and other services \u2014 this is where there are inconsistencies in terms of the additional charges.\u201d\n\nKhairy also announced that the industrial Covid-19 vaccination programme will start on June 16 in Pengerang, Johor, for workers in oil and gas company Petronas.\n\n\u201cWe have identified the Pengerang Complex as a high-risk area and we will be starting our PPV industries for employees in Petronas complex in Pengerang on 16th of June and the others to follow.\u201d\n\nUnlike the industrial Covid-19 vaccination programme, the Malaysian government has been covering the cost of administering vaccines, as the government-owned ProtectHealth pays private medical practitioners RM14 per dose for their inoculation services under PICK that has also utilised private health care facilities as vaccination centres. Both the industrial inoculation drive and PICK use vaccines supplied from the government.\n\nRecently, the government of India announced that private hospitals in the country will only be allowed to charge a maximum \u201cservice charge\u201d of 150 rupees (RM8.49) per dose in a fixed price of the jabs.\n\nThe Indian government said that it will provide Covid-19 vaccinations for free to all adults aged 18 and older from June 21, reversing an earlier decision that allowed states to procure their own vaccine supplies to vaccinate those aged between 18 and 44.\n\nKhairy also said today that the economic frontliners\u2019 vaccination programme will include a wide range of industries in order to pave the way for them to continue operating during movement control orders (MCO) in the country.\n\n\u201cThe arrangement or the discussions that we have been having with various industries, whether they are manufacturing, construction, retail, hospitality, is that if they would like to facilitate the vaccination of their employees, seeing some of these industries operate during the MCOs, we can proceed on a public-private partnership.\u201d", "keyword": ["fix", "vaccination", "ceiling", "khairy", "vaccines", "price", "cost", "industries", "protecthealth", "ministry", "programmes", "covid19", "health", "citf", "programme", "industrial"], "summary": "Khairy Jamaluddin says industries will absorb all additional costs of on-site Covid-19 vaccination programmes, including paying government-owned ProtectHealth Corporation, except the cost of vaccines itself that are provided free by the government.\nKUALA LUMPUR, June 9 \u2014 The Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) will set a ceiling price on vaccine administration charges under the Covid-19 inoculation programme for industries that use vaccines provided for free from the government.\nThis includes the hall rental and all the logistics that are necessary.\u201dEarlier, CodeBlue reported that the shopping malls are paying to the Ministry of Health (MOH)-owned ProtectHealth Corporation for on-site vaccination programmes.\nHowever, ProtectHealth denied collecting payments from shopping centres purportedly rolling out Covid-19 inoculation drives with vaccinators from ProtectHealth.\n\u201cNow the other charges for rental of premises and other services \u2014 this is where there are inconsistencies in terms of the additional charges.\u201dKhairy also announced that the industrial Covid-19 vaccination programme will start on June 16 in Pengerang, Johor, for workers in oil and gas company Petronas.", "news": "CodeBlue", "date": "2021-06-09 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Did MDCC President Catch MITI In A Gaffe?", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wNi8xMi9kaWQtbWRjYy1wcmVzaWRlbnQtY2F0Y2gtbWl0aS1pbi1hLWdhZmZlL9IBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wNi8xMi9kaWQtbWRjYy1wcmVzaWRlbnQtY2F0Y2gtbWl0aS1pbi1hLWdhZmZlL2FtcC8?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Azizul Rahman Ismail", "Maya Suraya"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dyana-wing-so-PAfM5FQ1Drk-unsplash.jpg", "text": "Subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates.\n\nIt began with a Twitter post by Malaysia Digital Chamber of Commerce (MDCC) president, Chris Daniel Wong, of a letter of permission by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI).

Since the 'total lockdown' or full MCO started on June 1, almost a week ago, there has been more confusion and questions now compared to the first MCO. Here is a list of issues I compiled based on media reports and social media postings over the past week.\n\n20 issues we are still unsure about a week into the full MCO:\n\n1) We still don\u2019t have a comprehensive list of which sectors or industries are under the jurisdiction of which ministry.\n\nWhen the full MCO was announced, I issued a statement asking the PN government to make public a comprehensive list of the different sectors of the economy and which ministries are responsible for overseeing them. This list has not been published.\n\nWe need to know this information even though the issuing of approval letters has gone back to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti)'s Cims 3.0 system. This is because the approvals still have to come from the respective ministries and there is still confusion among the ministries themselves as to which sectors they are responsible for.\n\n2) We still don\u2019t know if restaurants are allowed to operate if they have not gotten an approval letter from Miti\n\nOne example is restaurants. Although food and beverages (F&B) are considered essential items and F&B is considered an essential industry, it is unclear which ministry is responsible for approving the continued operations of the many thousands of restaurants in the entire country.\n\nThe Ministry of Housing and Local Government (KPKT) has said that hawkers only need to produce their license from the local authority to operate and will not have to wait for the Miti letter to continue to operate. But this has not stopped some irresponsible enforcement officers from pressuring hawkers into showing their Miti letter.\n\nSome restaurants continue to remain closed even for takeaway meals because they have not gotten their Miti approval letter yet. I have received some reports that the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) thinks that only franchise restaurants come under its purview but not the non-franchise restaurants. The National Security Council (NSC) has not clarified this issue at the time of writing.\n\n3) We don\u2019t know if those operating roadside stalls selling food and drinks can continue to operate without an approval letter from Miti\n\nThis is similar to the point above except that some of these stalls don\u2019t operate with a valid license from the local authority. But how about those who have been given a temporary license to operate by the local authorities in KL and Selangor, for example, during the Covid-19 pandemic? Can they continue to operate? Are the enforcement officers clear on this policy?\n\n4) We don\u2019t know what criteria was used to ban the sale of alcohol but allow the sale of cigarettes\n\nThe Deputy Minister of Trade and Consumer Affairs was reported to have said that the sale of alcohol was banned because it is considered as a non-essential item but the sale of cigarettes would continue to be allowed to cater for the \u201ccigarette addicts\u201d.\n\nLater on, Senior Minister (Security) Ismail Sabri Yaakob expressed his confusion over this statement since shops that sell beer such as 7-11 were still being allowed to operate. Some supermarkets then closed down the section of their operations selling beer and other alcoholic beverages to comply with the \u2018instruction\u2019 from the deputy minister. The Minister of Domestic Trade has not issued any public statement on this issue, as far as I know.\n\nI am not advocating for a ban on cigarettes. What I am asking, like many other Malaysians, is consistency and clarity in government policies on the part of the government.\n\nIf the production and sale of alcohol are banned during the full MCO, has the government considered that opportunists will take the opportunity to make and sell illegal alcohol which will be much more dangerous to consumers? Or have we forgotten the deaths of those through methanol poisoning by consuming cheap and illegal alcohol back in 2019?\n\n5) We still don\u2019t know if automotive/car workshops are allowed to operate if they have not gotten an approval letter from Miti\n\nEven though car workshops are listed as essential under the distributive trade category, it is still unclear which is the ministry that is supposed to give approval for these workshops to continue to operate.\n\nThe Ministry of Transport does not list auto workshops under the sectors that are under its jurisdiction for approval in its Smile application system. The Ministry of Domestic Trade is maintaining an elegant silence on this issue.\n\nSo many car workshops continue to remain closed. This means that those in the logistics sector needing servicing may face some challenges. And those who need to drive to work because they are working in the essential services sector must hope and pray their cars or motorcycles don\u2019t break down or require major servicing.\n\n6) We don\u2019t know if those who are in the distributive trade sector and supplying the essential services are allowed to operate and from which ministry do they seek approval from\n\nI know of someone who imports various types of PPE equipment to supply to the hospitals and Covid-19 quarantine centres in Malaysia. Without getting approval to operate, his company would not have been able to continue the supply of these essential items to the Ministry of Health.\n\nHe tried applying to the Ministry of Domestic Trade but the website and later, the Google form application, crashed. After trying various options, I was made to understand that his approval was finally granted. I am still unsure as to which was the approving ministry for his particular sector of the economy.\n\n7) We don\u2019t know if air-con maintenance and repair are allowed to operate and from which ministry they should seek approval to operate from\n\nCritical maintenance and repair are listed as one of the 17 essential services during the full MCO but I think it only applies to the construction sector. What about other maintenance and service operations that are critical for the continued operations of other essential sectors?\n\nFor example, if the air-conditioning system at a hospital breaks down, we need those in the air-conditioning service sector to do their repair work. For factories producing food and beverages, they also need their air circulation system to be maintained.\n\nIn fact, one can say that given the airborne nature of the Covid-10 virus, the air-conditioning sector should be considered as essential especially for the servicing of commercial (including factories) and government buildings. We are also unsure which ministry the air-con sector comes under.\n\n8) We don\u2019t know if plumbers are allowed to operate and from which ministry they should seek approval to operate from\n\nPlumbers are also important to ensure that the toilets in hospitals, factories, offices, and government buildings are \u201cflowing\u201d smoothly. But which ministry is in charge of approving plumbers to continue to operate under full MCO?\n\n9) We don\u2019t know if those servicing photocopiers and printers are allowed to operate and from which ministry they need to seek approval from\n\nI also received a request from a company whose sales and marketing arm services the photocopiers and provides printing paper to many government ministries and agencies including the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Finance.\n\nIf such companies are not allowed to operate, the ministries and even hospitals, may not have the required paper to print their documents on and also would not be able to have access to photocopiers and printers which have broken down and are being left unrepaired during the full MCO.\n\n10) We don\u2019t know what criteria are being used to approve or not to approve those who are in the essential services supply chain\n\nThere should have been a clear mapping and understanding of the sectors and companies which are critical to the continued operations of the essential services sectors. This can be used as the basis of approving, not approving, or approving at a much-reduced capacity, companies that are part of this supply chain.\n\nAs of today, we have not seen such a mapping or heard any explanations from any minister with regard to the bigger picture surrounding the supply chain for essential services.\n\n11) We don\u2019t know how children are going to learn online when computer and telco shops are closed and the stationery section in the supermarkets are shut down\n\nThe Minister of Education recently announced that classes will continue to remain online when school reopens on June 13 and 14. But many parents who want to repair their laptops and handphones used by their children for online learning at home cannot do so because all of these services are shut down during the full MCO.\n\nEven stationery sections of some supermarkets have been shut down, preventing parents from even buying stationery for their children to use at home.\n\n12) We don\u2019t know how people are supposed to Work From Home (WFH) if their laptops break down and their phones are damaged but IT and handphone shops are closed\n\nSimilarly, for those who have to work from home using their laptops and handphones, they better hope their devices don\u2019t break down during the full MCO since none of the places which repair these devices are open.\n\n(I had a problem with my laptop which could only be fixed at the HQ of the company and I was informed that this could only be done after the end of the full MCO. Thankfully I have the resources to buy a new laptop but what about those who don\u2019t have the funds to buy a laptop during such an emergency?)\n\n13) We don\u2019t know how those people who seek treatments from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) can continue to seek such treatments\n\nI was also told that those seeking treatments from TCM shops cannot do so during the full MCO. The operators of the TCM shops cannot even go to their shops to pack packages of herbs to send to their customers as they are not considered an essential service even though they provide health and other related relief to their customers.\n\n14) We don\u2019t know why hair colouring is not allowed to be sold at pharmacies\n\nApparently, some pharmacies sealed up the section of their stores selling hair colouring as it is deemed as a non-essential item. I cannot understand why the selling of hair colouring at a pharmacy that is already open can be detrimental to our overall fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n15) We don\u2019t know why the home improvement section in some shops e.g. Mr DIY are not allowed to be opened\n\nApparently, some sections of hardware shops that sell home improvement products have been cordoned off. I received a report via a tweet that a person couldn\u2019t buy \u201chooks\u201d for his bathroom from Mr DIY because this section had been cordoned off.\n\n16) We don\u2019t know how people are going to cook at home if some of their home appliances break down since electrical appliance stores are not opened and the sections selling some of these items in supermarkets are closed (e.g. rice cookers and kettles)\n\nHousehold appliances such as rice cookers and kettles have their shelf life. Some may short circuit during the full MCO because of overuse. But we may not be able to buy their replacements because those shops selling electrical appliances are not open and the sections selling some of these items in some supermarkets have been cordoned off.\n\nOf course, there is the option of buying these items online but delivery may take a few days and for some of the semi-urban areas, the preferred option would still be to go to the physical store to procure these items.\n\n17) We don\u2019t know how companies that are in non-essential sectors can continue to maintain their data centres in case of emergencies\n\nI know of a company that is in the non-essential sector but has an important data centre that stores and processes critical information to the financial services sector. For these companies, they need to have one or two people on standby to access the data center in case there is an emergency or if the server breaks down (for whatever reason).\n\nIs MDEC, the agency under the Ministry of Multimedia and Communications, that is in charge of data centre operations, aware of such issues happening?\n\n18) We cannot understand why some companies were issued letters of approval by Miti but when the QR code for the company is scanned by the police, the details reveal that it is considered as a non-essential industry\n\nThis is a bit of a technical issue but is important in terms of preventing companies and their staff from being unfairly fined. Some companies which are listed as essential services suddenly find that they are not classified as an essential service when the QR code on their Miti letter is scanned by the authorities including the police.\n\nThis means that the employees of companies with this sort of letter can potentially be fined thousands of ringgit for violating the full MCO. The photos above show information from an optometrist which is not classified as essential under the QR code scan even though a letter from Miti has been issued to allow this optometrist to continue to operate under the full MCO.\n\n19) We still don\u2019t understand why jogging is allowed but cycling is banned\n\nI appreciate the fact that jogging and exercising alone in our residential areas are still permitted. But I fail to understand why cycling alone is not permitted, especially if this person is cycling within a 10km radius of his or her home.\n\nFurthermore, some people actually cycle to work (including some factory workers in my constituency) and some people cycle to the morning market to do their grocery shopping. Will they be fined for cycling by the enforcement authorities?\n\n20) We still haven\u2019t heard the following ministers come together and separately give a press briefing on the sectors under their jurisdiction - Miti, Home Ministry, Domestic Trade, Communications and Multimedia, Housing and Local Government (just to name a few)\n\nI am not sure if a gag order has been issued by the prime minister to disallow ministers other than Ismail Sabri to have press briefings for the full MCO. But given the current confusion over the SOPs, shouldn\u2019t the ministers from the key ministries (as suggested above) organise a joint press conference to clear the air? We wait with bated breath for this to happen.\n\nONG KIAN MING is the DAP MP for Bangi and a former deputy minister of international trade and industry.", "keyword": ["sops", "lockdown", "dont",

agreed to be included in the Economic Frontliners Vaccination Programme (retail sector) and have employees at their outlets get vaccinated.\n\nShopping centres are currently applying to Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) to host vaccination centres (PPV) on their premises so retailers can sign up for on-site vaccination.\n\nCentral i-City Shopping Centre chief operating officer Anthony Dylan said 65% of its tenants supported the initiative.\n\n\u201cWe are hoping at least 70% of the mall\u2019s tenants will register with us as we play our part in achieving herd immunity as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cWe are proposing one floor of the carpark to be designated as a vaccination centre, with drive-through function.\n\n\u201cThe location is an alternative to event halls and large-scale venues to get the vaccination done.\n\n\u201cIt is conducive with natural ventilation, proper ingress and egress ramps for drive-through as well as as a suitable location nearby to store the vaccine in accordance with government requirements.\u201d\n\nCapitaLand, which manages seven malls namely 3 Damansara, Melawati Mall, The Mines and Sungei Wang Plaza in Klang Valley, Gurney Plaza as well as Queensbay Mall in Penang and East Coast Mall in Kuantan (Pahang), had also written to the authorities to consider using three of its malls as vaccination centres.\n\n\u201cWe are awaiting further clarifications from the authorities on costs and operational requirements.\n\n\u201cWe have communicated with our tenants to take part in this programme, \u201d said CapitaLand Malaysia Retail head Eddie Lim.\n\n\n\nLim: Over 80% of tenants at malls managed by CapitaLand want to sign up for the vaccination programme for retail frontliners.\n\n\u201cMore than 80% of our tenants are interested to sign up for the vaccination programme for retail frontliners.\n\n\u201cAs our malls remain open during this period, the vaccination exercise will help protect the health and well-being of our shoppers, tenants and staff.\n\n\u201cOur aim is to help the government look at different ideas for decentralisation and expedite the whole vaccination process, \u201d he said.\n\nSunway Malls and Theme Parks chief executive officer HC Chan said Sunway Malls planned to join the PPV drive rolled out by the government.\n\n\u201cThis is still in the early stages and we applaud the government\u2019s efforts to speed up vaccination by opening multiple channels across public and private sectors.\n\n\u201cThe road to recovery hinges on how fast and how wide the vaccination reaches the population.\n\n\u201cSunway had rolled out the first private large-scale vaccination centre for frontliners and the general population in Petaling district since March 2021 at Sunway Pyramid Convention Centre.\n\n\u201cSunway Malls has a staff strength of 12,000.\n\n\u201cThese retail frontliners, especially those in the essential sectors such as supermarket, convenience stores, food and beverage operators as well as pharmacies are in contact with the public daily, thus it is important that they get vaccinated as soon as possible to protect themselves and visitors.\n\n\n\nChan: Sunway Malls and Theme Parks\u2019 ultimate aim is to work with the government to achieve herd immunity as fast as possible.\n\n\u201cOur ultimate aim is to work closely with the government to achieve herd immunity as fast as possible, \u201d he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Bangsar Village 2 could be used as a vaccination centre for workers in the Telawi commercial area.Eng Lian Enterprise Sdn Bhd, which manages Bangsar Village 1,2 and 3 apart from some commercial lots in the area, has offered space for a vaccination centre.\n\nIts leasing manager Vincent Siow said the company had identified a vacant lot on the third floor of Bangsar Village 2 to be used for a vaccination exercise.\n\nNot only would it benefit its retailers\u2019 staff, he said the management had also proposed to include workers in the Telawi commercial centre.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to work with the Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) and KPDNHEP to propose Bangsar Village 2 as a vaccination centre to speed up the national vaccination programme.\n\n\u201cThe response from retailers has been encouraging.\n\n\u201cIf all goes well, we expect about 4,000 workers to receive their vaccination here, \u201d he said.\n\nSuria KLCC in Kuala Lumpur is another mall offering to be a vaccination centre.\n\nSuria KLCC Sdn Bhd, which manages the mall, issued a letter to its retailers on May 31 to submit names of employees interested to be inoculated at the premises by June 1.\n\nThe letter stated that the vaccination exercise will begin sometime this month.\n\n\n\nMost of the tenants at Sunway Pyramid in Petaling Jaya are eager to get their staff vaccinated under the Economic Frontliners Vaccination Programme (retail sector). \u2014 FAIHAN GHANI/The Star\n\nThe tenants that StarMetro spoke to at various malls said they were supportive of the vaccination initiative despite a nominal fee being charged to tenants.\n\nCaring Pharmacy senior pharmacy practice executive Ng Yi Ling said the company was supportive of the programme for shopping centres to be vaccination centres for their retailers.\n\n\u201cOur staff at Caring outlets nationwide are retail frontliners who deal with a huge number of customers, so they are exposed to a certain level of risk during this Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cVaccination for our staff is the best way to protect themselves and at the same time, boosts customer confidence when patronising our stores.\n\n\u201cIt is also geared towards achieving herd immunity the soonest possible.\n\n\u201cCaring encourages all our staff to be vaccinated once the request to set up a vaccination centre in malls is approved by the government, \u201d she told StarMetro.The pharmacy currently has 144 outlets nationwide with more than 1,100 staff, including pharmacists.\n\nNg opined that a small fee charged to tenants in order to get their workers vaccinated was reasonable.\n\n\u201cThe company is willing to chip in as part of its responsibility to get as many employees as we can vaccinated, \u201d she said.\n\n\n\nBangsar Village 2 management has offered to use a vacant lot on its third floor as a vaccination centre not only for mall staff but also for workers in the Telawi commercial area.\n\nDin Tai Fung Malaysia business development director Jeffrey Lim said all its restaurant employees, excluding pregnant women and those with allergies, were supportive of the programme and wanted to get vaccinated as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cOur 11 restaurants nationwide serve customers on a daily basis and we are very heartened to be considered as frontliners.\n\n\u201cWe believe that we can do our part in flattening the curve by getting vaccinated.\n\n\u201cThe company is also bearing the costs for our employees to ensure their safety, \u201d he said.\n\nTGV Cinemas sales and marketing general manager Mohit Bhargava said the company was fully supportive of the initiative.\n\n\u201cWe have enlisted our staff as part of the vaccination programme being rolled out at the shopping centres where we are tenants.\n\n\u201cIt is a collective effort to achieve herd immunity and definitely our frontline staff\u2019s safety is our priority,

said the list of essential services that have been authorised to operate had been clearly stated in his official statement issued on May 31.\n\n\u201cIn the list provided, it has been explained that convenience stores or mini markets and grocery stores are categorised as essential and given permission to operate \u2013 it simply means that all items in these convenience stores, therefore, can be

stores and convenience stores/mini marts and restaurants (only for takeaway).\n\n\u201cJust like in convenience stores, liquors are also sold among other essentials in supermarket beverages section and therefore, it can be sold to consumers. It must be stressed here that stores selling only liquor products are not allowed to operate,\u201d he added.\n\nNanta said the ministry took note of the National Security Council\u2019s (NSC) decision that allows the sale of liquor in convenience stores, given that the premises is licensed to sell them.\n\nThis was following claims by Bangi MP Dr Ong Kian Ming that the ministry had never issued any statements on this matter to clear the air as this issue had drawn the attention of the public.\n\nDr Ong also claimed that the ministry had \u2018maintained an elegant silence\u2019 on the issue of car workshops operation, which led to more confusion among business owners who were clueless on whether they were given permission to operate \u2013 causing many workshops to be closed and caused unnecessary inconveniences to many parties including consumers.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of car workshops, the media statement issued had also clarified that vehicle workshop services, maintenance and spare parts are listed as activities that are allowed to operate with the capacity of employees limited to 60 per cent only. However, car wash services are not allowed.\n\n\u201cTherefore, allegation that the ministry is keeping mum on these issues is baseless.

cooking oil in the market to reduce consumers\u2019 burden.\n\n\u201cThe government will inform the outcome of the discussions and the agreed mechanism,\u201d Nanta Linggi said in a statement.\n\nCOSS is a cooking oil subsidy programme aimed at alleviating consumers\u2019 cost of living, applicable to all groups.\n\nNanta Linggi said the subsidy is given to 1kg cooking oil packed in polybags and offered to consumers at RM2.50 per packet despite the price of crude palm oil (CPO) at the world market currently increasing.\n\n\u201cThe government has allocated 60,000 metric tonnes (MT) per month (or 720,000MT per year) which is equivalent to 60 million polybags per month (720 million polybags per year) for all Malaysians.\n\n\u201cThis is based on a consumption rate of 1.8kg per person per month (22kg per person per year),\u201d he said, adding that the government guarantees the quality of subsidised cooking oil sold in polybags are the same as those sold in bottles, as some are manufactured at the same factory.\n\nMeanwhile, cooking oil sold in plastic bottles and cans (2kg, 3kg, 5kg and 17kg) are not subsidised as the prices are determined by the CPO price at the world market.\n\n\u201cPeople have the choice to buy subsidised cooking oil in 1kg polybags or the unsubsidised ones in bottles and cans,\u201d the minister said.\n\nCurrently, the CPO price in the world market has reached more than RM4,500 per MT compared to around RM2,500 per MT before, which is equivalent to approximately RM4.50 per kg before being processed and bottled.\n\nThis means that CPO\u2019s cost alone, before packaged, is already more than RM22 for 5kg, excluding other costs such as processing, bottling, transportation and profits at all levels of factories, wholesalers, distributors and retailers.\n\nNanta Linggi said KPDNHEP enforcement is consistently monitoring the supply and price of goods in the market.\n\n\u201cThe enforcement will not hesitate to take action under the Price Control and Anti-Monitoring Act 2011 if it finds traders who are profiteering on the price of goods, including cooking oil,\u201d he said.\n\nKPDNHEP will exercise its powers such as enforcing controlled prices or ceiling prices.\n\nThe Festive Season Maximum Price Scheme is one example where the ministry enforced price controls for each festive season, where KPDNHEP anticipates

additional costs of on-site Covid-19 vaccination programmes, including paying government-owned ProtectHealth Corporation, except the cost of vaccines itself that are provided free by the government.\n\nKUALA LUMPUR, June 9 \u2014 The Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) will set a ceiling price on vaccine administration charges under the Covid-19 inoculation programme for industries that use vaccines provided for free from the government.\n\nVaccine Minister Khairy Jamaluddin said today that CITF is working with various ministries, including the International Trade and Industry Ministry (MITI), Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP), Ministry of Tourism, Arts & Culture (MOTAC), Ministry of Works (KKR), and other government agencies to inoculate economic frontliners in the country.\n\nAt the same time, Khairy, who acknowledged a wide range of charges that are being imposed by companies and industries for vaccine administration costs, said that CITF will set a ceiling price for those charges.\n\n\u201cSo CITF is working together with the relevant agencies to set a schedule of fair and reasonable charges that will be borne by industries and companies that participate in the PPV (public-private vaccination) industrial programme,\u201d Khairy said in a joint press conference today with Health Minister Dr Adham Baba.\n\n\u201cThis is above and beyond the charges paid to ProtectHealth to cover the private health care organisers. This includes the hall rental and all the logistics that are necessary.\u201d\n\nEarlier, CodeBlue reported that the shopping malls are paying to the Ministry of Health (MOH)-owned ProtectHealth Corporation for on-site vaccination programmes.\n\nThe Malaysia Shopping Malls Association (PPK) said that from the total of RM50 fee per person for two doses at on-site vaccination in malls, RM30 would go to ProtectHealth. However, ProtectHealth denied collecting payments from shopping centres purportedly rolling out Covid-19 inoculation drives with vaccinators from ProtectHealth.\n\nBut Khairy today said that the industries will absorb other additional costs of on-site vaccination programmes, except the cost of vaccines itself that will be supplied to industries at no cost from the government\u2019s National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme (PICK).\n\n\u201cSecondly, the industries will bear the cost of administering the vaccination. That will include the payment made to the health care organisations that are organised via ProtectHealth Corporation, which is a fully owned company of MOH,\u201d Khairy said.\n\n\u201cNow the other charges for rental of premises and other services \u2014 this is where there are inconsistencies in terms of the additional charges.\u201d\n\nKhairy also announced that the industrial Covid-19 vaccination programme will start on June 16 in Pengerang, Johor, for workers in oil and gas company Petronas.\n\n\u201cWe have identified the Pengerang Complex as a high-risk area and we will be starting our PPV industries for employees in Petronas complex in Pengerang on 16th of June and the others to follow.\u201d\n\nUnlike the industrial Covid-19 vaccination programme, the Malaysian government has been covering the cost of administering vaccines, as the government-owned ProtectHealth pays private medical practitioners RM14 per dose for their inoculation services under PICK that has also utilised private health care facilities as vaccination centres. Both the industrial inoculation drive and PICK use vaccines supplied from the government.\n\nRecently, the government of India announced that private hospitals in the country will only be allowed to charge a maximum \u201cservice charge\u201d of 150 rupees (RM8.49) per dose in a fixed price of the jabs.\n\nThe Indian government said that it will provide Covid-19 vaccinations for free to all adults aged 18 and older from June 21, reversing an earlier decision that allowed states to procure their own vaccine supplies to vaccinate those aged between 18 and 44.\n\nKhairy also said today that the economic frontliners\u2019 vaccination programme will include a wide range of industries in order to pave the way for them to continue operating during movement control orders (MCO) in the country.\n\n\u201cThe arrangement or the discussions that we have been having with various industries, whether they are manufacturing, construction, retail, hospitality, is that if they would like to facilitate the vaccination of their employees, seeing some of these industries operate during the MCOs, we can proceed on a public-private partnership.\u201d", "keyword": ["fix", "vaccination", "ceiling", "khairy", "vaccines", "price", "cost", "industries", "protecthealth", "ministry", "programmes", "covid19", "health", "citf", "programme", "industrial"], "summary": "Khairy Jamaluddin says industries will absorb all additional costs of on-site Covid-19 vaccination programmes, including paying government-owned ProtectHealth Corporation, except the cost of vaccines itself that are provided free by the government.\nKUALA LUMPUR, June 9 \u2014 The Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) will set a ceiling price on vaccine administration charges under the Covid-19 inoculation programme for industries that use vaccines provided for free from the government.\nThis includes the hall rental and all the logistics that are necessary.\u201dEarlier, CodeBlue reported that the shopping malls are paying to the Ministry of Health (MOH)-owned ProtectHealth Corporation for on-site vaccination programmes.\nHowever, ProtectHealth denied collecting payments from shopping centres purportedly rolling out Covid-19 inoculation drives with vaccinators from ProtectHealth.\n\u201cNow the other charges for rental of premises and other services \u2014 this is where there are inconsistencies in terms of the additional charges.\u201dKhairy also announced that the industrial Covid-19 vaccination programme will start on June 16 in Pengerang, Johor, for workers in oil and gas company Petronas.", "news": "CodeBlue", "date": "2021-06-09 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Did MDCC President Catch MITI In A Gaffe?", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wNi8xMi9kaWQtbWRjYy1wcmVzaWRlbnQtY2F0Y2gtbWl0aS1pbi1hLWdhZmZlL9IBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wNi8xMi9kaWQtbWRjYy1wcmVzaWRlbnQtY2F0Y2gtbWl0aS1pbi1hLWdhZmZlL2FtcC8?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Azizul Rahman Ismail", "Maya Suraya"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dyana-wing-so-PAfM5FQ1Drk-unsplash.jpg", "text": "Subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates.\n\nIt began with a Twitter post by Malaysia Digital Chamber of Commerce (MDCC) president, Chris Daniel Wong, of a letter of permission by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI).

Since the 'total lockdown' or full MCO started on June 1, almost a week ago, there has been more confusion and questions now compared to the first MCO. Here is a list of issues I compiled based on media reports and social media postings over the past week.\n\n20 issues we are still unsure about a week into the full MCO:\n\n1) We still don\u2019t have a comprehensive list of which sectors or industries are under the jurisdiction of which ministry.\n\nWhen the full MCO was announced, I issued a statement asking the PN government to make public a comprehensive list of the different sectors of the economy and which ministries are responsible for overseeing them. This list has not been published.\n\nWe need to know this information even though the issuing of approval letters has gone back to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti)'s Cims 3.0 system. This is because the approvals still have to come from the respective ministries and there is still confusion among the ministries themselves as to which sectors they are responsible for.\n\n2) We still don\u2019t know if restaurants are allowed to operate if they have not gotten an approval letter from Miti\n\nOne example is restaurants. Although food and beverages (F&B) are considered essential items and F&B is considered an essential industry, it is unclear which ministry is responsible for approving the continued operations of the many thousands of restaurants in the entire country.\n\nThe Ministry of Housing and Local Government (KPKT) has said that hawkers only need to produce their license from the local authority to operate and will not have to wait for the Miti letter to continue to operate. But this has not stopped some irresponsible enforcement officers from pressuring hawkers into showing their Miti letter.\n\nSome restaurants continue to remain closed even for takeaway meals because they have not gotten their Miti approval letter yet. I have received some reports that the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) thinks that only franchise restaurants come under its purview but not the non-franchise restaurants. The National Security Council (NSC) has not clarified this issue at the time of writing.\n\n3) We don\u2019t know if those operating roadside stalls selling food and drinks can continue to operate without an approval letter from Miti\n\nThis is similar to the point above except that some of these stalls don\u2019t operate with a valid license from the local authority. But how about those who have been given a temporary license to operate by the local authorities in KL and Selangor, for example, during the Covid-19 pandemic? Can they continue to operate? Are the enforcement officers clear on this policy?\n\n4) We don\u2019t know what criteria was used to ban the sale of alcohol but allow the sale of cigarettes\n\nThe Deputy Minister of Trade and Consumer Affairs was reported to have said that the sale of alcohol was banned because it is considered as a non-essential item but the sale of cigarettes would continue to be allowed to cater for the \u201ccigarette addicts\u201d.\n\nLater on, Senior Minister (Security) Ismail Sabri Yaakob expressed his confusion over this statement since shops that sell beer such as 7-11 were still being allowed to operate. Some supermarkets then closed down the section of their operations selling beer and other alcoholic beverages to comply with the \u2018instruction\u2019 from the deputy minister. The Minister of Domestic Trade has not issued any public statement on this issue, as far as I know.\n\nI am not advocating for a ban on cigarettes. What I am asking, like many other Malaysians, is consistency and clarity in government policies on the part of the government.\n\nIf the production and sale of alcohol are banned during the full MCO, has the government considered that opportunists will take the opportunity to make and sell illegal alcohol which will be much more dangerous to consumers? Or have we forgotten the deaths of those through methanol poisoning by consuming cheap and illegal alcohol back in 2019?\n\n5) We still don\u2019t know if automotive/car workshops are allowed to operate if they have not gotten an approval letter from Miti\n\nEven though car workshops are listed as essential under the distributive trade category, it is still unclear which is the ministry that is supposed to give approval for these workshops to continue to operate.\n\nThe Ministry of Transport does not list auto workshops under the sectors that are under its jurisdiction for approval in its Smile application system. The Ministry of Domestic Trade is maintaining an elegant silence on this issue.\n\nSo many car workshops continue to remain closed. This means that those in the logistics sector needing servicing may face some challenges. And those who need to drive to work because they are working in the essential services sector must hope and pray their cars or motorcycles don\u2019t break down or require major servicing.\n\n6) We don\u2019t know if those who are in the distributive trade sector and supplying the essential services are allowed to operate and from which ministry do they seek approval from\n\nI know of someone who imports various types of PPE equipment to supply to the hospitals and Covid-19 quarantine centres in Malaysia. Without getting approval to operate, his company would not have been able to continue the supply of these essential items to the Ministry of Health.\n\nHe tried applying to the Ministry of Domestic Trade but the website and later, the Google form application, crashed. After trying various options, I was made to understand that his approval was finally granted. I am still unsure as to which was the approving ministry for his particular sector of the economy.\n\n7) We don\u2019t know if air-con maintenance and repair are allowed to operate and from which ministry they should seek approval to operate from\n\nCritical maintenance and repair are listed as one of the 17 essential services during the full MCO but I think it only applies to the construction sector. What about other maintenance and service operations that are critical for the continued operations of other essential sectors?\n\nFor example, if the air-conditioning system at a hospital breaks down, we need those in the air-conditioning service sector to do their repair work. For factories producing food and beverages, they also need their air circulation system to be maintained.\n\nIn fact, one can say that given the airborne nature of the Covid-10 virus, the air-conditioning sector should be considered as essential especially for the servicing of commercial (including factories) and government buildings. We are also unsure which ministry the air-con sector comes under.\n\n8) We don\u2019t know if plumbers are allowed to operate and from which ministry they should seek approval to operate from\n\nPlumbers are also important to ensure that the toilets in hospitals, factories, offices, and government buildings are \u201cflowing\u201d smoothly. But which ministry is in charge of approving plumbers to continue to operate under full MCO?\n\n9) We don\u2019t know if those servicing photocopiers and printers are allowed to operate and from which ministry they need to seek approval from\n\nI also received a request from a company whose sales and marketing arm services the photocopiers and provides printing paper to many government ministries and agencies including the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Finance.\n\nIf such companies are not allowed to operate, the ministries and even hospitals, may not have the required paper to print their documents on and also would not be able to have access to photocopiers and printers which have broken down and are being left unrepaired during the full MCO.\n\n10) We don\u2019t know what criteria are being used to approve or not to approve those who are in the essential services supply chain\n\nThere should have been a clear mapping and understanding of the sectors and companies which are critical to the continued operations of the essential services sectors. This can be used as the basis of approving, not approving, or approving at a much-reduced capacity, companies that are part of this supply chain.\n\nAs of today, we have not seen such a mapping or heard any explanations from any minister with regard to the bigger picture surrounding the supply chain for essential services.\n\n11) We don\u2019t know how children are going to learn online when computer and telco shops are closed and the stationery section in the supermarkets are shut down\n\nThe Minister of Education recently announced that classes will continue to remain online when school reopens on June 13 and 14. But many parents who want to repair their laptops and handphones used by their children for online learning at home cannot do so because all of these services are shut down during the full MCO.\n\nEven stationery sections of some supermarkets have been shut down, preventing parents from even buying stationery for their children to use at home.\n\n12) We don\u2019t know how people are supposed to Work From Home (WFH) if their laptops break down and their phones are damaged but IT and handphone shops are closed\n\nSimilarly, for those who have to work from home using their laptops and handphones, they better hope their devices don\u2019t break down during the full MCO since none of the places which repair these devices are open.\n\n(I had a problem with my laptop which could only be fixed at the HQ of the company and I was informed that this could only be done after the end of the full MCO. Thankfully I have the resources to buy a new laptop but what about those who don\u2019t have the funds to buy a laptop during such an emergency?)\n\n13) We don\u2019t know how those people who seek treatments from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) can continue to seek such treatments\n\nI was also told that those seeking treatments from TCM shops cannot do so during the full MCO. The operators of the TCM shops cannot even go to their shops to pack packages of herbs to send to their customers as they are not considered an essential service even though they provide health and other related relief to their customers.\n\n14) We don\u2019t know why hair colouring is not allowed to be sold at pharmacies\n\nApparently, some pharmacies sealed up the section of their stores selling hair colouring as it is deemed as a non-essential item. I cannot understand why the selling of hair colouring at a pharmacy that is already open can be detrimental to our overall fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n15) We don\u2019t know why the home improvement section in some shops e.g. Mr DIY are not allowed to be opened\n\nApparently, some sections of hardware shops that sell home improvement products have been cordoned off. I received a report via a tweet that a person couldn\u2019t buy \u201chooks\u201d for his bathroom from Mr DIY because this section had been cordoned off.\n\n16) We don\u2019t know how people are going to cook at home if some of their home appliances break down since electrical appliance stores are not opened and the sections selling some of these items in supermarkets are closed (e.g. rice cookers and kettles)\n\nHousehold appliances such as rice cookers and kettles have their shelf life. Some may short circuit during the full MCO because of overuse. But we may not be able to buy their replacements because those shops selling electrical appliances are not open and the sections selling some of these items in some supermarkets have been cordoned off.\n\nOf course, there is the option of buying these items online but delivery may take a few days and for some of the semi-urban areas, the preferred option would still be to go to the physical store to procure these items.\n\n17) We don\u2019t know how companies that are in non-essential sectors can continue to maintain their data centres in case of emergencies\n\nI know of a company that is in the non-essential sector but has an important data centre that stores and processes critical information to the financial services sector. For these companies, they need to have one or two people on standby to access the data center in case there is an emergency or if the server breaks down (for whatever reason).\n\nIs MDEC, the agency under the Ministry of Multimedia and Communications, that is in charge of data centre operations, aware of such issues happening?\n\n18) We cannot understand why some companies were issued letters of approval by Miti but when the QR code for the company is scanned by the police, the details reveal that it is considered as a non-essential industry\n\nThis is a bit of a technical issue but is important in terms of preventing companies and their staff from being unfairly fined. Some companies which are listed as essential services suddenly find that they are not classified as an essential service when the QR code on their Miti letter is scanned by the authorities including the police.\n\nThis means that the employees of companies with this sort of letter can potentially be fined thousands of ringgit for violating the full MCO. The photos above show information from an optometrist which is not classified as essential under the QR code scan even though a letter from Miti has been issued to allow this optometrist to continue to operate under the full MCO.\n\n19) We still don\u2019t understand why jogging is allowed but cycling is banned\n\nI appreciate the fact that jogging and exercising alone in our residential areas are still permitted. But I fail to understand why cycling alone is not permitted, especially if this person is cycling within a 10km radius of his or her home.\n\nFurthermore, some people actually cycle to work (including some factory workers in my constituency) and some people cycle to the morning market to do their grocery shopping. Will they be fined for cycling by the enforcement authorities?\n\n20) We still haven\u2019t heard the following ministers come together and separately give a press briefing on the sectors under their jurisdiction - Miti, Home Ministry, Domestic Trade, Communications and Multimedia, Housing and Local Government (just to name a few)\n\nI am not sure if a gag order has been issued by the prime minister to disallow ministers other than Ismail Sabri to have press briefings for the full MCO. But given the current confusion over the SOPs, shouldn\u2019t the ministers from the key ministries (as suggested above) organise a joint press conference to clear the air? We wait with bated breath for this to happen.\n\nONG KIAN MING is the DAP MP for Bangi and a former deputy minister of international trade and industry.", "keyword": ["sops", "lockdown", "dont",

agreed to be included in the Economic Frontliners Vaccination Programme (retail sector) and have employees at their outlets get vaccinated.\n\nShopping centres are currently applying to Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) to host vaccination centres (PPV) on their premises so retailers can sign up for on-site vaccination.\n\nCentral i-City Shopping Centre chief operating officer Anthony Dylan said 65% of its tenants supported the initiative.\n\n\u201cWe are hoping at least 70% of the mall\u2019s tenants will register with us as we play our part in achieving herd immunity as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cWe are proposing one floor of the carpark to be designated as a vaccination centre, with drive-through function.\n\n\u201cThe location is an alternative to event halls and large-scale venues to get the vaccination done.\n\n\u201cIt is conducive with natural ventilation, proper ingress and egress ramps for drive-through as well as as a suitable location nearby to store the vaccine in accordance with government requirements.\u201d\n\nCapitaLand, which manages seven malls namely 3 Damansara, Melawati Mall, The Mines and Sungei Wang Plaza in Klang Valley, Gurney Plaza as well as Queensbay Mall in Penang and East Coast Mall in Kuantan (Pahang), had also written to the authorities to consider using three of its malls as vaccination centres.\n\n\u201cWe are awaiting further clarifications from the authorities on costs and operational requirements.\n\n\u201cWe have communicated with our tenants to take part in this programme, \u201d said CapitaLand Malaysia Retail head Eddie Lim.\n\n\n\nLim: Over 80% of tenants at malls managed by CapitaLand want to sign up for the vaccination programme for retail frontliners.\n\n\u201cMore than 80% of our tenants are interested to sign up for the vaccination programme for retail frontliners.\n\n\u201cAs our malls remain open during this period, the vaccination exercise will help protect the health and well-being of our shoppers, tenants and staff.\n\n\u201cOur aim is to help the government look at different ideas for decentralisation and expedite the whole vaccination process, \u201d he said.\n\nSunway Malls and Theme Parks chief executive officer HC Chan said Sunway Malls planned to join the PPV drive rolled out by the government.\n\n\u201cThis is still in the early stages and we applaud the government\u2019s efforts to speed up vaccination by opening multiple channels across public and private sectors.\n\n\u201cThe road to recovery hinges on how fast and how wide the vaccination reaches the population.\n\n\u201cSunway had rolled out the first private large-scale vaccination centre for frontliners and the general population in Petaling district since March 2021 at Sunway Pyramid Convention Centre.\n\n\u201cSunway Malls has a staff strength of 12,000.\n\n\u201cThese retail frontliners, especially those in the essential sectors such as supermarket, convenience stores, food and beverage operators as well as pharmacies are in contact with the public daily, thus it is important that they get vaccinated as soon as possible to protect themselves and visitors.\n\n\n\nChan: Sunway Malls and Theme Parks\u2019 ultimate aim is to work with the government to achieve herd immunity as fast as possible.\n\n\u201cOur ultimate aim is to work closely with the government to achieve herd immunity as fast as possible, \u201d he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Bangsar Village 2 could be used as a vaccination centre for workers in the Telawi commercial area.Eng Lian Enterprise Sdn Bhd, which manages Bangsar Village 1,2 and 3 apart from some commercial lots in the area, has offered space for a vaccination centre.\n\nIts leasing manager Vincent Siow said the company had identified a vacant lot on the third floor of Bangsar Village 2 to be used for a vaccination exercise.\n\nNot only would it benefit its retailers\u2019 staff, he said the management had also proposed to include workers in the Telawi commercial centre.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to work with the Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) and KPDNHEP to propose Bangsar Village 2 as a vaccination centre to speed up the national vaccination programme.\n\n\u201cThe response from retailers has been encouraging.\n\n\u201cIf all goes well, we expect about 4,000 workers to receive their vaccination here, \u201d he said.\n\nSuria KLCC in Kuala Lumpur is another mall offering to be a vaccination centre.\n\nSuria KLCC Sdn Bhd, which manages the mall, issued a letter to its retailers on May 31 to submit names of employees interested to be inoculated at the premises by June 1.\n\nThe letter stated that the vaccination exercise will begin sometime this month.\n\n\n\nMost of the tenants at Sunway Pyramid in Petaling Jaya are eager to get their staff vaccinated under the Economic Frontliners Vaccination Programme (retail sector). \u2014 FAIHAN GHANI/The Star\n\nThe tenants that StarMetro spoke to at various malls said they were supportive of the vaccination initiative despite a nominal fee being charged to tenants.\n\nCaring Pharmacy senior pharmacy practice executive Ng Yi Ling said the company was supportive of the programme for shopping centres to be vaccination centres for their retailers.\n\n\u201cOur staff at Caring outlets nationwide are retail frontliners who deal with a huge number of customers, so they are exposed to a certain level of risk during this Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cVaccination for our staff is the best way to protect themselves and at the same time, boosts customer confidence when patronising our stores.\n\n\u201cIt is also geared towards achieving herd immunity the soonest possible.\n\n\u201cCaring encourages all our staff to be vaccinated once the request to set up a vaccination centre in malls is approved by the government, \u201d she told StarMetro.The pharmacy currently has 144 outlets nationwide with more than 1,100 staff, including pharmacists.\n\nNg opined that a small fee charged to tenants in order to get their workers vaccinated was reasonable.\n\n\u201cThe company is willing to chip in as part of its responsibility to get as many employees as we can vaccinated, \u201d she said.\n\n\n\nBangsar Village 2 management has offered to use a vacant lot on its third floor as a vaccination centre not only for mall staff but also for workers in the Telawi commercial area.\n\nDin Tai Fung Malaysia business development director Jeffrey Lim said all its restaurant employees, excluding pregnant women and those with allergies, were supportive of the programme and wanted to get vaccinated as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cOur 11 restaurants nationwide serve customers on a daily basis and we are very heartened to be considered as frontliners.\n\n\u201cWe believe that we can do our part in flattening the curve by getting vaccinated.\n\n\u201cThe company is also bearing the costs for our employees to ensure their safety, \u201d he said.\n\nTGV Cinemas sales and marketing general manager Mohit Bhargava said the company was fully supportive of the initiative.\n\n\u201cWe have enlisted our staff as part of the vaccination programme being rolled out at the shopping centres where we are tenants.\n\n\u201cIt is a collective effort to achieve herd immunity and definitely our frontline staff\u2019s safety is our priority,

sold to consumers, including alcohol and cigarettes.\n\n\u201cIn the supermarket premises and hypermarkets, the sale of goods is limited to food and beverages/basic necessities, pharmacy/personal care stores and convenience stores/mini marts and restaurants (only for takeaway).\n\n\u201cJust like in convenience stores, liquors are also sold among other essentials in supermarket beverages section and therefore, it can be sold to consumers.

However, car wash services are not allowed.\n\n\u201cTherefore, allegation that the ministry is keeping mum on these issues is baseless.

Ministry (KPDNHEP) and the Finance Ministry have allocated RM600 million this year compared to last year\u2019s RM528 million for the Cooking Oil Stabilisation Scheme (COSS).\n\nKPDNHEP Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi said his ministry is in discussions with several other ministries and agencies related to improving the price implementation mechanism for subsidised and non-subsidised cooking oil in the market to reduce consumers\u2019 burden.\n\n\u201cThe government will inform the outcome of the discussions and the agreed mechanism,\u201d Nanta Linggi said in a statement.\n\nCOSS is a cooking oil subsidy programme aimed at alleviating consumers\u2019 cost of living, applicable to all groups.\n\nNanta Linggi said the subsidy is given to 1kg cooking oil packed in polybags and offered to consumers at RM2.50 per packet despite the price of crude palm oil (CPO) at the world market currently increasing.\n\n\u201cThe government has allocated 60,000 metric tonnes (MT) per month (or 720,000MT per year) which is equivalent to 60 million polybags per month (720 million polybags per year) for all Malaysians.\n\n\u201cThis is based on a consumption rate of 1.8kg per person per month (22kg per person per year),\u201d he said, adding that the government guarantees the quality of subsidised cooking oil sold in polybags are the same as those sold in bottles, as some are manufactured at the same factory.\n\nMeanwhile, cooking oil sold in plastic bottles and cans (2kg, 3kg, 5kg and 17kg) are not subsidised as the prices are determined by the CPO price at the world market.\n\n\u201cPeople have the choice to buy subsidised cooking oil in 1kg polybags or the unsubsidised ones in bottles and cans,\u201d the minister said.\n\nCurrently, the CPO price in the world market has reached more than RM4,500 per MT compared to around RM2,500 per MT before, which is equivalent to approximately RM4.50 per kg before being processed and bottled.\n\nThis means that CPO\u2019s cost alone, before packaged, is already more than RM22 for 5kg, excluding other costs such as processing, bottling, transportation and profits at all levels of factories, wholesalers, distributors and retailers.\n\nNanta Linggi said KPDNHEP enforcement is consistently monitoring the supply and price of goods in the market.\n\n\u201cThe enforcement will not hesitate to take action under the Price Control and Anti-Monitoring Act 2011 if it finds traders who are profiteering on the price of goods, including cooking oil,\u201d he said.\n\nKPDNHEP will exercise its powers such as enforcing controlled prices or ceiling prices.\n\nThe Festive Season Maximum Price Scheme is one example where the ministry enforced price controls for each festive season, where KPDNHEP anticipates

Section 21 of the Price Control and Anti-Profiteering Act 2011,\u201d KPDNHEP said in a statement yesterday.\n\nThe rise in cooking oil prices was caused by the increasing costs of major raw materials for cooking oil production such as crude palm oil which continues to increase since last year.\n\n\u201cTraders are reminded not to take advantage by profiteering as this will result in the instability of the price of essential goods in the market which will eventually be a burden to the people.\n\n\u201cStern action will be taken against those who profiteer,\u201d the ministry said.

would directly impact the public for their daily use of the commodity and also affect household and business spending.\n\n\u201cThe price must be controlled as it will affect the country\u2019s

will lead to other problems such as traders raising their food prices,\u201d he told Bernama.\n\nHe was commenting on the price increase on the two-kilogramme (kg) and five-kg bottled cooking oil

over RM4,300 per tonne compared to around RN2,500 previously, equivalent to about RM4.30 per kg before being processed and bottled.\n\nThis means the cost of crude palm oil has exceeded RM21 for 5 kg, without taking into account the other costs such as bottling, transportation and profit at the factory, wholesaler, distributor and retailer levels.\n\nHowever, Shazali said seeing Malaysia as among the largest producers of palm oil in the world, it was illogical if local consumers were forced to bear the burden of its price increase in the global market.\n\nHe suggested that KPDNHEP use the controlled float system for the price of bottled palm oil as had been done to decide the prices of petrol and diesel.\n\nBut one maximum price must be set although it was not a subsidised item, as a long-term solution, he said.\n\nHe also suggested that the government implement the windfall tax on palm oil producing companies which reaped huge profits from the current hike in the price of crude palm oil globally. \u2014 Bernama", "keyword": ["increase", "fix", "oil", "ceiling", "hike", "price", "avoid", "subsidised", "excessive", "crude", "world", "palm", "bottled", "cooking", "kg"],

additional costs of on-site Covid-19 vaccination programmes, including paying government-owned ProtectHealth Corporation, except the cost of vaccines itself that are provided free by the government.\n\nKUALA LUMPUR, June 9 \u2014 The Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) will set a ceiling price on vaccine administration charges under the Covid-19 inoculation programme for industries that use vaccines provided for free from the government.\n\nVaccine Minister Khairy Jamaluddin said today that CITF is working with various ministries, including the International Trade and Industry Ministry (MITI), Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP), Ministry of Tourism, Arts & Culture (MOTAC), Ministry of Works (KKR), and other government agencies to inoculate economic frontliners in the country.\n\nAt the same time, Khairy, who acknowledged a wide range of charges that are being imposed by companies and industries for vaccine administration costs, said that CITF will set a ceiling price for those charges.\n\n\u201cSo CITF is working together with the relevant agencies to set a schedule of fair and reasonable charges that will be borne by industries and companies that participate in the PPV (public-private vaccination) industrial programme,\u201d Khairy said in a joint press conference today with Health Minister Dr Adham Baba.\n\n\u201cThis is above and beyond the charges paid to ProtectHealth to cover the private health care organisers. This includes the hall rental and all the logistics that are necessary.\u201d\n\nEarlier, CodeBlue reported that the shopping malls are paying to the Ministry of Health (MOH)-owned ProtectHealth Corporation for on-site vaccination programmes.\n\nThe Malaysia Shopping Malls Association (PPK) said that from the total of RM50 fee per person for two doses at on-site vaccination in malls, RM30 would go to ProtectHealth. However, ProtectHealth denied collecting payments from shopping centres purportedly rolling out Covid-19 inoculation drives with vaccinators from ProtectHealth.\n\nBut Khairy today said that the industries will absorb other additional costs of on-site vaccination programmes, except the cost of vaccines itself that will be supplied to industries at no cost from the government\u2019s National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme (PICK).\n\n\u201cSecondly, the industries will bear the cost of administering the vaccination. That will include the payment made to the health care organisations that are organised via ProtectHealth Corporation, which is a fully owned company of MOH,\u201d Khairy said.\n\n\u201cNow the other charges for rental of premises and other services \u2014 this is where there are inconsistencies in terms of the additional charges.\u201d\n\nKhairy also announced that the industrial Covid-19 vaccination programme will start on June 16 in Pengerang, Johor, for workers in oil and gas company Petronas.\n\n\u201cWe have identified the Pengerang Complex as a high-risk area and we will be starting our PPV industries for employees in Petronas complex in Pengerang on 16th of June and the others to follow.\u201d\n\nUnlike the industrial Covid-19 vaccination programme, the Malaysian government has been covering the cost of administering vaccines, as the government-owned ProtectHealth pays private medical practitioners RM14 per dose for their inoculation services under PICK that has also utilised private health care facilities as vaccination centres. Both the industrial inoculation drive and PICK use vaccines supplied from the government.\n\nRecently, the government of India announced that private hospitals in the country will only be allowed to charge a maximum \u201cservice charge\u201d of 150 rupees (RM8.49) per dose in a fixed price of the jabs.\n\nThe Indian government said that it will provide Covid-19 vaccinations for free to all adults aged 18 and older from June 21, reversing an earlier decision that allowed states to procure their own vaccine supplies to vaccinate those aged between 18 and 44.\n\nKhairy also said today that the economic frontliners\u2019 vaccination programme will include a wide range of industries in order to pave the way for them to continue operating during movement control orders (MCO) in the country.\n\n\u201cThe arrangement or the discussions that we have been having with various industries, whether they are manufacturing, construction, retail, hospitality, is that if they would like to facilitate the vaccination of their employees, seeing some of these industries operate during the MCOs, we can proceed on a public-private partnership.\u201d", "keyword": ["fix", "vaccination", "ceiling", "khairy", "vaccines", "price", "cost", "industries", "protecthealth", "ministry", "programmes", "covid19", "health", "citf", "programme", "industrial"], "summary": "Khairy Jamaluddin says industries will absorb all additional costs of on-site Covid-19 vaccination programmes, including paying government-owned ProtectHealth Corporation, except the cost of vaccines itself that are provided free by the government.\nKUALA LUMPUR, June 9 \u2014 The Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) will set a ceiling price on vaccine administration charges under the Covid-19 inoculation programme for industries that use vaccines provided for free from the government.\nThis includes the hall rental and all the logistics that are necessary.\u201dEarlier, CodeBlue reported that the shopping malls are paying to the Ministry of Health (MOH)-owned ProtectHealth Corporation for on-site vaccination programmes.\nHowever, ProtectHealth denied collecting payments from shopping centres purportedly rolling out Covid-19 inoculation drives with vaccinators from ProtectHealth.\n\u201cNow the other charges for rental of premises and other services \u2014 this is where there are inconsistencies in terms of the additional charges.\u201dKhairy also announced that the industrial Covid-19 vaccination programme will start on June 16 in Pengerang, Johor, for workers in oil and gas company Petronas.", "news": "CodeBlue", "date": "2021-06-09 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Did MDCC President Catch MITI In A Gaffe?", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wNi8xMi9kaWQtbWRjYy1wcmVzaWRlbnQtY2F0Y2gtbWl0aS1pbi1hLWdhZmZlL9IBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wNi8xMi9kaWQtbWRjYy1wcmVzaWRlbnQtY2F0Y2gtbWl0aS1pbi1hLWdhZmZlL2FtcC8?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Azizul Rahman Ismail", "Maya Suraya"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dyana-wing-so-PAfM5FQ1Drk-unsplash.jpg", "text": "Subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates.\n\nIt began with a Twitter post by Malaysia Digital Chamber of Commerce (MDCC) president, Chris Daniel Wong, of a letter of permission by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI).

Since the 'total lockdown' or full MCO started on June 1, almost a week ago, there has been more confusion and questions now compared to the first MCO. Here is a list of issues I compiled based on media reports and social media postings over the past week.\n\n20 issues we are still unsure about a week into the full MCO:\n\n1) We still don\u2019t have a comprehensive list of which sectors or industries are under the jurisdiction of which ministry.\n\nWhen the full MCO was announced, I issued a statement asking the PN government to make public a comprehensive list of the different sectors of the economy and which ministries are responsible for overseeing them. This list has not been published.\n\nWe need to know this information even though the issuing of approval letters has gone back to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti)'s Cims 3.0 system. This is because the approvals still have to come from the respective ministries and there is still confusion among the ministries themselves as to which sectors they are responsible for.\n\n2) We still don\u2019t know if restaurants are allowed to operate if they have not gotten an approval letter from Miti\n\nOne example is restaurants. Although food and beverages (F&B) are considered essential items and F&B is considered an essential industry, it is unclear which ministry is responsible for approving the continued operations of the many thousands of restaurants in the entire country.\n\nThe Ministry of Housing and Local Government (KPKT) has said that hawkers only need to produce their license from the local authority to operate and will not have to wait for the Miti letter to continue to operate. But this has not stopped some irresponsible enforcement officers from pressuring hawkers into showing their Miti letter.\n\nSome restaurants continue to remain closed even for takeaway meals because they have not gotten their Miti approval letter yet. I have received some reports that the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) thinks that only franchise restaurants come under its purview but not the non-franchise restaurants. The National Security Council (NSC) has not clarified this issue at the time of writing.\n\n3) We don\u2019t know if those operating roadside stalls selling food and drinks can continue to operate without an approval letter from Miti\n\nThis is similar to the point above except that some of these stalls don\u2019t operate with a valid license from the local authority. But how about those who have been given a temporary license to operate by the local authorities in KL and Selangor, for example, during the Covid-19 pandemic? Can they continue to operate? Are the enforcement officers clear on this policy?\n\n4) We don\u2019t know what criteria was used to ban the sale of alcohol but allow the sale of cigarettes\n\nThe Deputy Minister of Trade and Consumer Affairs was reported to have said that the sale of alcohol was banned because it is considered as a non-essential item but the sale of cigarettes would continue to be allowed to cater for the \u201ccigarette addicts\u201d.\n\nLater on, Senior Minister (Security) Ismail Sabri Yaakob expressed his confusion over this statement since shops that sell beer such as 7-11 were still being allowed to operate. Some supermarkets then closed down the section of their operations selling beer and other alcoholic beverages to comply with the \u2018instruction\u2019 from the deputy minister. The Minister of Domestic Trade has not issued any public statement on this issue, as far as I know.\n\nI am not advocating for a ban on cigarettes. What I am asking, like many other Malaysians, is consistency and clarity in government policies on the part of the government.\n\nIf the production and sale of alcohol are banned during the full MCO, has the government considered that opportunists will take the opportunity to make and sell illegal alcohol which will be much more dangerous to consumers? Or have we forgotten the deaths of those through methanol poisoning by consuming cheap and illegal alcohol back in 2019?\n\n5) We still don\u2019t know if automotive/car workshops are allowed to operate if they have not gotten an approval letter from Miti\n\nEven though car workshops are listed as essential under the distributive trade category, it is still unclear which is the ministry that is supposed to give approval for these workshops to continue to operate.\n\nThe Ministry of Transport does not list auto workshops under the sectors that are under its jurisdiction for approval in its Smile application system. The Ministry of Domestic Trade is maintaining an elegant silence on this issue.\n\nSo many car workshops continue to remain closed. This means that those in the logistics sector needing servicing may face some challenges. And those who need to drive to work because they are working in the essential services sector must hope and pray their cars or motorcycles don\u2019t break down or require major servicing.\n\n6) We don\u2019t know if those who are in the distributive trade sector and supplying the essential services are allowed to operate and from which ministry do they seek approval from\n\nI know of someone who imports various types of PPE equipment to supply to the hospitals and Covid-19 quarantine centres in Malaysia. Without getting approval to operate, his company would not have been able to continue the supply of these essential items to the Ministry of Health.\n\nHe tried applying to the Ministry of Domestic Trade but the website and later, the Google form application, crashed. After trying various options, I was made to understand that his approval was finally granted. I am still unsure as to which was the approving ministry for his particular sector of the economy.\n\n7) We don\u2019t know if air-con maintenance and repair are allowed to operate and from which ministry they should seek approval to operate from\n\nCritical maintenance and repair are listed as one of the 17 essential services during the full MCO but I think it only applies to the construction sector. What about other maintenance and service operations that are critical for the continued operations of other essential sectors?\n\nFor example, if the air-conditioning system at a hospital breaks down, we need those in the air-conditioning service sector to do their repair work. For factories producing food and beverages, they also need their air circulation system to be maintained.\n\nIn fact, one can say that given the airborne nature of the Covid-10 virus, the air-conditioning sector should be considered as essential especially for the servicing of commercial (including factories) and government buildings. We are also unsure which ministry the air-con sector comes under.\n\n8) We don\u2019t know if plumbers are allowed to operate and from which ministry they should seek approval to operate from\n\nPlumbers are also important to ensure that the toilets in hospitals, factories, offices, and government buildings are \u201cflowing\u201d smoothly. But which ministry is in charge of approving plumbers to continue to operate under full MCO?\n\n9) We don\u2019t know if those servicing photocopiers and printers are allowed to operate and from which ministry they need to seek approval from\n\nI also received a request from a company whose sales and marketing arm services the photocopiers and provides printing paper to many government ministries and agencies including the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Finance.\n\nIf such companies are not allowed to operate, the ministries and even hospitals, may not have the required paper to print their documents on and also would not be able to have access to photocopiers and printers which have broken down and are being left unrepaired during the full MCO.\n\n10) We don\u2019t know what criteria are being used to approve or not to approve those who are in the essential services supply chain\n\nThere should have been a clear mapping and understanding of the sectors and companies which are critical to the continued operations of the essential services sectors. This can be used as the basis of approving, not approving, or approving at a much-reduced capacity, companies that are part of this supply chain.\n\nAs of today, we have not seen such a mapping or heard any explanations from any minister with regard to the bigger picture surrounding the supply chain for essential services.\n\n11) We don\u2019t know how children are going to learn online when computer and telco shops are closed and the stationery section in the supermarkets are shut down\n\nThe Minister of Education recently announced that classes will continue to remain online when school reopens on June 13 and 14. But many parents who want to repair their laptops and handphones used by their children for online learning at home cannot do so because all of these services are shut down during the full MCO.\n\nEven stationery sections of some supermarkets have been shut down, preventing parents from even buying stationery for their children to use at home.\n\n12) We don\u2019t know how people are supposed to Work From Home (WFH) if their laptops break down and their phones are damaged but IT and handphone shops are closed\n\nSimilarly, for those who have to work from home using their laptops and handphones, they better hope their devices don\u2019t break down during the full MCO since none of the places which repair these devices are open.\n\n(I had a problem with my laptop which could only be fixed at the HQ of the company and I was informed that this could only be done after the end of the full MCO. Thankfully I have the resources to buy a new laptop but what about those who don\u2019t have the funds to buy a laptop during such an emergency?)\n\n13) We don\u2019t know how those people who seek treatments from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) can continue to seek such treatments\n\nI was also told that those seeking treatments from TCM shops cannot do so during the full MCO. The operators of the TCM shops cannot even go to their shops to pack packages of herbs to send to their customers as they are not considered an essential service even though they provide health and other related relief to their customers.\n\n14) We don\u2019t know why hair colouring is not allowed to be sold at pharmacies\n\nApparently, some pharmacies sealed up the section of their stores selling hair colouring as it is deemed as a non-essential item. I cannot understand why the selling of hair colouring at a pharmacy that is already open can be detrimental to our overall fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n15) We don\u2019t know why the home improvement section in some shops e.g. Mr DIY are not allowed to be opened\n\nApparently, some sections of hardware shops that sell home improvement products have been cordoned off. I received a report via a tweet that a person couldn\u2019t buy \u201chooks\u201d for his bathroom from Mr DIY because this section had been cordoned off.\n\n16) We don\u2019t know how people are going to cook at home if some of their home appliances break down since electrical appliance stores are not opened and the sections selling some of these items in supermarkets are closed (e.g. rice cookers and kettles)\n\nHousehold appliances such as rice cookers and kettles have their shelf life. Some may short circuit during the full MCO because of overuse. But we may not be able to buy their replacements because those shops selling electrical appliances are not open and the sections selling some of these items in some supermarkets have been cordoned off.\n\nOf course, there is the option of buying these items online but delivery may take a few days and for some of the semi-urban areas, the preferred option would still be to go to the physical store to procure these items.\n\n17) We don\u2019t know how companies that are in non-essential sectors can continue to maintain their data centres in case of emergencies\n\nI know of a company that is in the non-essential sector but has an important data centre that stores and processes critical information to the financial services sector. For these companies, they need to have one or two people on standby to access the data center in case there is an emergency or if the server breaks down (for whatever reason).\n\nIs MDEC, the agency under the Ministry of Multimedia and Communications, that is in charge of data centre operations, aware of such issues happening?\n\n18) We cannot understand why some companies were issued letters of approval by Miti but when the QR code for the company is scanned by the police, the details reveal that it is considered as a non-essential industry\n\nThis is a bit of a technical issue but is important in terms of preventing companies and their staff from being unfairly fined. Some companies which are listed as essential services suddenly find that they are not classified as an essential service when the QR code on their Miti letter is scanned by the authorities including the police.\n\nThis means that the employees of companies with this sort of letter can potentially be fined thousands of ringgit for violating the full MCO. The photos above show information from an optometrist which is not classified as essential under the QR code scan even though a letter from Miti has been issued to allow this optometrist to continue to operate under the full MCO.\n\n19) We still don\u2019t understand why jogging is allowed but cycling is banned\n\nI appreciate the fact that jogging and exercising alone in our residential areas are still permitted. But I fail to understand why cycling alone is not permitted, especially if this person is cycling within a 10km radius of his or her home.\n\nFurthermore, some people actually cycle to work (including some factory workers in my constituency) and some people cycle to the morning market to do their grocery shopping. Will they be fined for cycling by the enforcement authorities?\n\n20) We still haven\u2019t heard the following ministers come together and separately give a press briefing on the sectors under their jurisdiction - Miti, Home Ministry, Domestic Trade, Communications and Multimedia, Housing and Local Government (just to name a few)\n\nI am not sure if a gag order has been issued by the prime minister to disallow ministers other than Ismail Sabri to have press briefings for the full MCO. But given the current confusion over the SOPs, shouldn\u2019t the ministers from the key ministries (as suggested above) organise a joint press conference to clear the air? We wait with bated breath for this to happen.\n\nONG KIAN MING is the DAP MP for Bangi and a former deputy minister of international trade and industry.", "keyword": ["sops", "lockdown", "dont",

agreed to be included in the Economic Frontliners Vaccination Programme (retail sector) and have employees at their outlets get vaccinated.\n\nShopping centres are currently applying to Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) to host vaccination centres (PPV) on their premises so retailers can sign up for on-site vaccination.\n\nCentral i-City Shopping Centre chief operating officer Anthony Dylan said 65% of its tenants supported the initiative.\n\n\u201cWe are hoping at least 70% of the mall\u2019s tenants will register with us as we play our part in achieving herd immunity as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cWe are proposing one floor of the carpark to be designated as a vaccination centre, with drive-through function.\n\n\u201cThe location is an alternative to event halls and large-scale venues to get the vaccination done.\n\n\u201cIt is conducive with natural ventilation, proper ingress and egress ramps for drive-through as well as as a suitable location nearby to store the vaccine in accordance with government requirements.\u201d\n\nCapitaLand, which manages seven malls namely 3 Damansara, Melawati Mall, The Mines and Sungei Wang Plaza in Klang Valley, Gurney Plaza as well as Queensbay Mall in Penang and East Coast Mall in Kuantan (Pahang), had also written to the authorities to consider using three of its malls as vaccination centres.\n\n\u201cWe are awaiting further clarifications from the authorities on costs and operational requirements.\n\n\u201cWe have communicated with our tenants to take part in this programme, \u201d said CapitaLand Malaysia Retail head Eddie Lim.\n\n\n\nLim: Over 80% of tenants at malls managed by CapitaLand want to sign up for the vaccination programme for retail frontliners.\n\n\u201cMore than 80% of our tenants are interested to sign up for the vaccination programme for retail frontliners.\n\n\u201cAs our malls remain open during this period, the vaccination exercise will help protect the health and well-being of our shoppers, tenants and staff.\n\n\u201cOur aim is to help the government look at different ideas for decentralisation and expedite the whole vaccination process, \u201d he said.\n\nSunway Malls and Theme Parks chief executive officer HC Chan said Sunway Malls planned to join the PPV drive rolled out by the government.\n\n\u201cThis is still in the early stages and we applaud the government\u2019s efforts to speed up vaccination by opening multiple channels across public and private sectors.\n\n\u201cThe road to recovery hinges on how fast and how wide the vaccination reaches the population.\n\n\u201cSunway had rolled out the first private large-scale vaccination centre for frontliners and the general population in Petaling district since March 2021 at Sunway Pyramid Convention Centre.\n\n\u201cSunway Malls has a staff strength of 12,000.\n\n\u201cThese retail frontliners, especially those in the essential sectors such as supermarket, convenience stores, food and beverage operators as well as pharmacies are in contact with the public daily, thus it is important that they get vaccinated as soon as possible to protect themselves and visitors.\n\n\n\nChan: Sunway Malls and Theme Parks\u2019 ultimate aim is to work with the government to achieve herd immunity as fast as possible.\n\n\u201cOur ultimate aim is to work closely with the government to achieve herd immunity as fast as possible, \u201d he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Bangsar Village 2 could be used as a vaccination centre for workers in the Telawi commercial area.Eng Lian Enterprise Sdn Bhd, which manages Bangsar Village 1,2 and 3 apart from some commercial lots in the area, has offered space for a vaccination centre.\n\nIts leasing manager Vincent Siow said the company had identified a vacant lot on the third floor of Bangsar Village 2 to be used for a vaccination exercise.\n\nNot only would it benefit its retailers\u2019 staff, he said the management had also proposed to include workers in the Telawi commercial centre.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to work with the Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) and KPDNHEP to propose Bangsar Village 2 as a vaccination centre to speed up the national vaccination programme.\n\n\u201cThe response from retailers has been encouraging.\n\n\u201cIf all goes well, we expect about 4,000 workers to receive their vaccination here, \u201d he said.\n\nSuria KLCC in Kuala Lumpur is another mall offering to be a vaccination centre.\n\nSuria KLCC Sdn Bhd, which manages the mall, issued a letter to its retailers on May 31 to submit names of employees interested to be inoculated at the premises by June 1.\n\nThe letter stated that the vaccination exercise will begin sometime this month.\n\n\n\nMost of the tenants at Sunway Pyramid in Petaling Jaya are eager to get their staff vaccinated under the Economic Frontliners Vaccination Programme (retail sector). \u2014 FAIHAN GHANI/The Star\n\nThe tenants that StarMetro spoke to at various malls said they were supportive of the vaccination initiative despite a nominal fee being charged to tenants.\n\nCaring Pharmacy senior pharmacy practice executive Ng Yi Ling said the company was supportive of the programme for shopping centres to be vaccination centres for their retailers.\n\n\u201cOur staff at Caring outlets nationwide are retail frontliners who deal with a huge number of customers, so they are exposed to a certain level of risk during this Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cVaccination for our staff is the best way to protect themselves and at the same time, boosts customer confidence when patronising our stores.\n\n\u201cIt is also geared towards achieving herd immunity the soonest possible.\n\n\u201cCaring encourages all our staff to be vaccinated once the request to set up a vaccination centre in malls is approved by the government, \u201d she told StarMetro.The pharmacy currently has 144 outlets nationwide with more than 1,100 staff, including pharmacists.\n\nNg opined that a small fee charged to tenants in order to get their workers vaccinated was reasonable.\n\n\u201cThe company is willing to chip in as part of its responsibility to get as many employees as we can vaccinated, \u201d she said.\n\n\n\nBangsar Village 2 management has offered to use a vacant lot on its third floor as a vaccination centre not only for mall staff but also for workers in the Telawi commercial area.\n\nDin Tai Fung Malaysia business development director Jeffrey Lim said all its restaurant employees, excluding pregnant women and those with allergies, were supportive of the programme and wanted to get vaccinated as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cOur 11 restaurants nationwide serve customers on a daily basis and we are very heartened to be considered as frontliners.\n\n\u201cWe believe that we can do our part in flattening the curve by getting vaccinated.\n\n\u201cThe company is also bearing the costs for our employees to ensure their safety, \u201d he said.\n\nTGV Cinemas sales and marketing general manager Mohit Bhargava said the company was fully supportive of the initiative.\n\n\u201cWe have enlisted our staff as part of the vaccination programme being rolled out at the shopping centres where we are tenants.\n\n\u201cIt is a collective effort to achieve herd immunity and definitely our frontline staff\u2019s safety is our priority,

Ministry (KPDNHEP) and the Finance Ministry have allocated RM600 million this year compared to last year\u2019s RM528 million for the Cooking Oil Stabilisation Scheme (COSS).\n\nKPDNHEP Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi said his ministry is in discussions with several other ministries and agencies related to improving the price implementation mechanism for subsidised and non-subsidised cooking oil in the market to reduce consumers\u2019 burden.\n\n\u201cThe government will inform the outcome of the discussions and the agreed mechanism,\u201d Nanta Linggi said in a statement.\n\nCOSS is a cooking oil subsidy programme aimed at alleviating consumers\u2019 cost of living, applicable to all groups.\n\nNanta Linggi said the subsidy is given to 1kg cooking oil packed in polybags and offered to consumers at RM2.50 per packet despite the price of crude palm oil (CPO) at the world market currently increasing.\n\n\u201cThe government has allocated 60,000 metric tonnes (MT) per month (or 720,000MT per year) which is equivalent to 60 million polybags per month (720 million polybags per year) for all Malaysians.\n\n\u201cThis is based on a consumption rate of 1.8kg per person per month (22kg per person per year),\u201d he said, adding that the government guarantees the quality of subsidised cooking oil sold in polybags are the same as those sold in bottles, as some are manufactured at the same factory.\n\nMeanwhile, cooking oil sold in plastic bottles and cans (2kg, 3kg, 5kg and 17kg) are not subsidised as the prices are determined by the CPO price at the world market.\n\n\u201cPeople have the choice to buy subsidised cooking oil in 1kg polybags or the unsubsidised ones in bottles and cans,\u201d the minister said.\n\nCurrently, the CPO price in the world market has reached more than RM4,500 per MT compared to around RM2,500 per MT before, which is equivalent to approximately RM4.50 per kg before being processed and bottled.\n\nThis means that CPO\u2019s cost alone, before packaged, is already more than RM22 for 5kg, excluding other costs such as processing, bottling, transportation and profits at all levels of factories, wholesalers, distributors and retailers.\n\nNanta Linggi said KPDNHEP enforcement is consistently monitoring the supply and price of goods in the market.\n\n\u201cThe enforcement will not hesitate to take action under the Price Control and Anti-Monitoring Act 2011 if it finds traders who are profiteering on the price of goods, including cooking oil,\u201d he said.\n\nKPDNHEP will exercise its powers such as enforcing controlled prices or ceiling prices.\n\nThe Festive Season Maximum Price Scheme is one example where the ministry enforced price controls for each festive season, where KPDNHEP anticipates

the largest producers of palm oil in the world, it was illogical if local consumers were forced to bear the burden of its price increase in the global market.\n\nHe suggested that KPDNHEP use the

additional costs of on-site Covid-19 vaccination programmes, including paying government-owned ProtectHealth Corporation, except the cost of vaccines itself that are provided free by the government.\n\nKUALA LUMPUR, June 9 \u2014 The Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) will set a ceiling price on vaccine administration charges under the Covid-19 inoculation programme for industries that use vaccines provided for free from the government.\n\nVaccine Minister Khairy Jamaluddin said today that CITF is working with various ministries, including the International Trade and Industry Ministry (MITI), Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP), Ministry of Tourism, Arts & Culture (MOTAC), Ministry of Works (KKR), and other government agencies to inoculate economic frontliners in the country.\n\nAt the same time, Khairy, who acknowledged a wide range of charges that are being imposed by companies and industries for vaccine administration costs, said that CITF will set a ceiling price for those charges.\n\n\u201cSo CITF is working together with the relevant agencies to set a schedule of fair and reasonable charges that will be borne by industries and companies that participate in the PPV (public-private vaccination) industrial programme,\u201d Khairy said in a joint press conference today with Health Minister Dr Adham Baba.\n\n\u201cThis is above and beyond the charges paid to ProtectHealth to cover the private health care organisers. This includes the hall rental and all the logistics that are necessary.\u201d\n\nEarlier, CodeBlue reported that the shopping malls are paying to the Ministry of Health (MOH)-owned ProtectHealth Corporation for on-site vaccination programmes.\n\nThe Malaysia Shopping Malls Association (PPK) said that from the total of RM50 fee per person for two doses at on-site vaccination in malls, RM30 would go to ProtectHealth. However, ProtectHealth denied collecting payments from shopping centres purportedly rolling out Covid-19 inoculation drives with vaccinators from ProtectHealth.\n\nBut Khairy today said that the industries will absorb other additional costs of on-site vaccination programmes, except the cost of vaccines itself that will be supplied to industries at no cost from the government\u2019s National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme (PICK).\n\n\u201cSecondly, the industries will bear the cost of administering the vaccination. That will include the payment made to the health care organisations that are organised via ProtectHealth Corporation, which is a fully owned company of MOH,\u201d Khairy said.\n\n\u201cNow the other charges for rental of premises and other services \u2014 this is where there are inconsistencies in terms of the additional charges.\u201d\n\nKhairy also announced that the industrial Covid-19 vaccination programme will start on June 16 in Pengerang, Johor, for workers in oil and gas company Petronas.\n\n\u201cWe have identified the Pengerang Complex as a high-risk area and we will be starting our PPV industries for employees in Petronas complex in Pengerang on 16th of June and the others to follow.\u201d\n\nUnlike the industrial Covid-19 vaccination programme, the Malaysian government has been covering the cost of administering vaccines, as the government-owned ProtectHealth pays private medical practitioners RM14 per dose for their inoculation services under PICK that has also utilised private health care facilities as vaccination centres. Both the industrial inoculation drive and PICK use vaccines supplied from the government.\n\nRecently, the government of India announced that private hospitals in the country will only be allowed to charge a maximum \u201cservice charge\u201d of 150 rupees (RM8.49) per dose in a fixed price of the jabs.\n\nThe Indian government said that it will provide Covid-19 vaccinations for free to all adults aged 18 and older from June 21, reversing an earlier decision that allowed states to procure their own vaccine supplies to vaccinate those aged between 18 and 44.\n\nKhairy also said today that the economic frontliners\u2019 vaccination programme will include a wide range of industries in order to pave the way for them to continue operating during movement control orders (MCO) in the country.\n\n\u201cThe arrangement or the discussions that we have been having with various industries, whether they are manufacturing, construction, retail, hospitality, is that if they would like to facilitate the vaccination of their employees, seeing some of these industries operate during the MCOs, we can proceed on a public-private partnership.\u201d", "keyword": ["fix", "vaccination", "ceiling", "khairy", "vaccines", "price", "cost", "industries", "protecthealth", "ministry", "programmes", "covid19", "health", "citf", "programme", "industrial"], "summary": "Khairy Jamaluddin says industries will absorb all additional costs of on-site Covid-19 vaccination programmes, including paying government-owned ProtectHealth Corporation, except the cost of vaccines itself that are provided free by the government.\nKUALA LUMPUR, June 9 \u2014 The Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) will set a ceiling price on vaccine administration charges under the Covid-19 inoculation programme for industries that use vaccines provided for free from the government.\nThis includes the hall rental and all the logistics that are necessary.\u201dEarlier, CodeBlue reported that the shopping malls are paying to the Ministry of Health (MOH)-owned ProtectHealth Corporation for on-site vaccination programmes.\nHowever, ProtectHealth denied collecting payments from shopping centres purportedly rolling out Covid-19 inoculation drives with vaccinators from ProtectHealth.\n\u201cNow the other charges for rental of premises and other services \u2014 this is where there are inconsistencies in terms of the additional charges.\u201dKhairy also announced that the industrial Covid-19 vaccination programme will start on June 16 in Pengerang, Johor, for workers in oil and gas company Petronas.", "news": "CodeBlue", "date": "2021-06-09 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Did MDCC President Catch MITI In A Gaffe?", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wNi8xMi9kaWQtbWRjYy1wcmVzaWRlbnQtY2F0Y2gtbWl0aS1pbi1hLWdhZmZlL9IBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wNi8xMi9kaWQtbWRjYy1wcmVzaWRlbnQtY2F0Y2gtbWl0aS1pbi1hLWdhZmZlL2FtcC8?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Azizul Rahman Ismail", "Maya Suraya"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dyana-wing-so-PAfM5FQ1Drk-unsplash.jpg", "text": "Subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates.\n\nIt began with a Twitter post by Malaysia Digital Chamber of Commerce (MDCC) president, Chris Daniel Wong, of a letter of permission by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI).

Since the 'total lockdown' or full MCO started on June 1, almost a week ago, there has been more confusion and questions now compared to the first MCO. Here is a list of issues I compiled based on media reports and social media postings over the past week.\n\n20 issues we are still unsure about a week into the full MCO:\n\n1) We still don\u2019t have a comprehensive list of which sectors or industries are under the jurisdiction of which ministry.\n\nWhen the full MCO was announced, I issued a statement asking the PN government to make public a comprehensive list of the different sectors of the economy and which ministries are responsible for overseeing them. This list has not been published.\n\nWe need to know this information even though the issuing of approval letters has gone back to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti)'s Cims 3.0 system. This is because the approvals still have to come from the respective ministries and there is still confusion among the ministries themselves as to which sectors they are responsible for.\n\n2) We still don\u2019t know if restaurants are allowed to operate if they have not gotten an approval letter from Miti\n\nOne example is restaurants. Although food and beverages (F&B) are considered essential items and F&B is considered an essential industry, it is unclear which ministry is responsible for approving the continued operations of the many thousands of restaurants in the entire country.\n\nThe Ministry of Housing and Local Government (KPKT) has said that hawkers only need to produce their license from the local authority to operate and will not have to wait for the Miti letter to continue to operate. But this has not stopped some irresponsible enforcement officers from pressuring hawkers into showing their Miti letter.\n\nSome restaurants continue to remain closed even for takeaway meals because they have not gotten their Miti approval letter yet. I have received some reports that the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) thinks that only franchise restaurants come under its purview but not the non-franchise restaurants. The National Security Council (NSC) has not clarified this issue at the time of writing.\n\n3) We don\u2019t know if those operating roadside stalls selling food and drinks can continue to operate without an approval letter from Miti\n\nThis is similar to the point above except that some of these stalls don\u2019t operate with a valid license from the local authority. But how about those who have been given a temporary license to operate by the local authorities in KL and Selangor, for example, during the Covid-19 pandemic? Can they continue to operate? Are the enforcement officers clear on this policy?\n\n4) We don\u2019t know what criteria was used to ban the sale of alcohol but allow the sale of cigarettes\n\nThe Deputy Minister of Trade and Consumer Affairs was reported to have said that the sale of alcohol was banned because it is considered as a non-essential item but the sale of cigarettes would continue to be allowed to cater for the \u201ccigarette addicts\u201d.\n\nLater on, Senior Minister (Security) Ismail Sabri Yaakob expressed his confusion over this statement since shops that sell beer such as 7-11 were still being allowed to operate. Some supermarkets then closed down the section of their operations selling beer and other alcoholic beverages to comply with the \u2018instruction\u2019 from the deputy minister. The Minister of Domestic Trade has not issued any public statement on this issue, as far as I know.\n\nI am not advocating for a ban on cigarettes. What I am asking, like many other Malaysians, is consistency and clarity in government policies on the part of the government.\n\nIf the production and sale of alcohol are banned during the full MCO, has the government considered that opportunists will take the opportunity to make and sell illegal alcohol which will be much more dangerous to consumers? Or have we forgotten the deaths of those through methanol poisoning by consuming cheap and illegal alcohol back in 2019?\n\n5) We still don\u2019t know if automotive/car workshops are allowed to operate if they have not gotten an approval letter from Miti\n\nEven though car workshops are listed as essential under the distributive trade category, it is still unclear which is the ministry that is supposed to give approval for these workshops to continue to operate.\n\nThe Ministry of Transport does not list auto workshops under the sectors that are under its jurisdiction for approval in its Smile application system. The Ministry of Domestic Trade is maintaining an elegant silence on this issue.\n\nSo many car workshops continue to remain closed. This means that those in the logistics sector needing servicing may face some challenges. And those who need to drive to work because they are working in the essential services sector must hope and pray their cars or motorcycles don\u2019t break down or require major servicing.\n\n6) We don\u2019t know if those who are in the distributive trade sector and supplying the essential services are allowed to operate and from which ministry do they seek approval from\n\nI know of someone who imports various types of PPE equipment to supply to the hospitals and Covid-19 quarantine centres in Malaysia. Without getting approval to operate, his company would not have been able to continue the supply of these essential items to the Ministry of Health.\n\nHe tried applying to the Ministry of Domestic Trade but the website and later, the Google form application, crashed. After trying various options, I was made to understand that his approval was finally granted. I am still unsure as to which was the approving ministry for his particular sector of the economy.\n\n7) We don\u2019t know if air-con maintenance and repair are allowed to operate and from which ministry they should seek approval to operate from\n\nCritical maintenance and repair are listed as one of the 17 essential services during the full MCO but I think it only applies to the construction sector. What about other maintenance and service operations that are critical for the continued operations of other essential sectors?\n\nFor example, if the air-conditioning system at a hospital breaks down, we need those in the air-conditioning service sector to do their repair work. For factories producing food and beverages, they also need their air circulation system to be maintained.\n\nIn fact, one can say that given the airborne nature of the Covid-10 virus, the air-conditioning sector should be considered as essential especially for the servicing of commercial (including factories) and government buildings. We are also unsure which ministry the air-con sector comes under.\n\n8) We don\u2019t know if plumbers are allowed to operate and from which ministry they should seek approval to operate from\n\nPlumbers are also important to ensure that the toilets in hospitals, factories, offices, and government buildings are \u201cflowing\u201d smoothly. But which ministry is in charge of approving plumbers to continue to operate under full MCO?\n\n9) We don\u2019t know if those servicing photocopiers and printers are allowed to operate and from which ministry they need to seek approval from\n\nI also received a request from a company whose sales and marketing arm services the photocopiers and provides printing paper to many government ministries and agencies including the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Finance.\n\nIf such companies are not allowed to operate, the ministries and even hospitals, may not have the required paper to print their documents on and also would not be able to have access to photocopiers and printers which have broken down and are being left unrepaired during the full MCO.\n\n10) We don\u2019t know what criteria are being used to approve or not to approve those who are in the essential services supply chain\n\nThere should have been a clear mapping and understanding of the sectors and companies which are critical to the continued operations of the essential services sectors. This can be used as the basis of approving, not approving, or approving at a much-reduced capacity, companies that are part of this supply chain.\n\nAs of today, we have not seen such a mapping or heard any explanations from any minister with regard to the bigger picture surrounding the supply chain for essential services.\n\n11) We don\u2019t know how children are going to learn online when computer and telco shops are closed and the stationery section in the supermarkets are shut down\n\nThe Minister of Education recently announced that classes will continue to remain online when school reopens on June 13 and 14. But many parents who want to repair their laptops and handphones used by their children for online learning at home cannot do so because all of these services are shut down during the full MCO.\n\nEven stationery sections of some supermarkets have been shut down, preventing parents from even buying stationery for their children to use at home.\n\n12) We don\u2019t know how people are supposed to Work From Home (WFH) if their laptops break down and their phones are damaged but IT and handphone shops are closed\n\nSimilarly, for those who have to work from home using their laptops and handphones, they better hope their devices don\u2019t break down during the full MCO since none of the places which repair these devices are open.\n\n(I had a problem with my laptop which could only be fixed at the HQ of the company and I was informed that this could only be done after the end of the full MCO. Thankfully I have the resources to buy a new laptop but what about those who don\u2019t have the funds to buy a laptop during such an emergency?)\n\n13) We don\u2019t know how those people who seek treatments from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) can continue to seek such treatments\n\nI was also told that those seeking treatments from TCM shops cannot do so during the full MCO. The operators of the TCM shops cannot even go to their shops to pack packages of herbs to send to their customers as they are not considered an essential service even though they provide health and other related relief to their customers.\n\n14) We don\u2019t know why hair colouring is not allowed to be sold at pharmacies\n\nApparently, some pharmacies sealed up the section of their stores selling hair colouring as it is deemed as a non-essential item. I cannot understand why the selling of hair colouring at a pharmacy that is already open can be detrimental to our overall fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n15) We don\u2019t know why the home improvement section in some shops e.g. Mr DIY are not allowed to be opened\n\nApparently, some sections of hardware shops that sell home improvement products have been cordoned off. I received a report via a tweet that a person couldn\u2019t buy \u201chooks\u201d for his bathroom from Mr DIY because this section had been cordoned off.\n\n16) We don\u2019t know how people are going to cook at home if some of their home appliances break down since electrical appliance stores are not opened and the sections selling some of these items in supermarkets are closed (e.g. rice cookers and kettles)\n\nHousehold appliances such as rice cookers and kettles have their shelf life. Some may short circuit during the full MCO because of overuse. But we may not be able to buy their replacements because those shops selling electrical appliances are not open and the sections selling some of these items in some supermarkets have been cordoned off.\n\nOf course, there is the option of buying these items online but delivery may take a few days and for some of the semi-urban areas, the preferred option would still be to go to the physical store to procure these items.\n\n17) We don\u2019t know how companies that are in non-essential sectors can continue to maintain their data centres in case of emergencies\n\nI know of a company that is in the non-essential sector but has an important data centre that stores and processes critical information to the financial services sector. For these companies, they need to have one or two people on standby to access the data center in case there is an emergency or if the server breaks down (for whatever reason).\n\nIs MDEC, the agency under the Ministry of Multimedia and Communications, that is in charge of data centre operations, aware of such issues happening?\n\n18) We cannot understand why some companies were issued letters of approval by Miti but when the QR code for the company is scanned by the police, the details reveal that it is considered as a non-essential industry\n\nThis is a bit of a technical issue but is important in terms of preventing companies and their staff from being unfairly fined. Some companies which are listed as essential services suddenly find that they are not classified as an essential service when the QR code on their Miti letter is scanned by the authorities including the police.\n\nThis means that the employees of companies with this sort of letter can potentially be fined thousands of ringgit for violating the full MCO. The photos above show information from an optometrist which is not classified as essential under the QR code scan even though a letter from Miti has been issued to allow this optometrist to continue to operate under the full MCO.\n\n19) We still don\u2019t understand why jogging is allowed but cycling is banned\n\nI appreciate the fact that jogging and exercising alone in our residential areas are still permitted. But I fail to understand why cycling alone is not permitted, especially if this person is cycling within a 10km radius of his or her home.\n\nFurthermore, some people actually cycle to work (including some factory workers in my constituency) and some people cycle to the morning market to do their grocery shopping. Will they be fined for cycling by the enforcement authorities?\n\n20) We still haven\u2019t heard the following ministers come together and separately give a press briefing on the sectors under their jurisdiction - Miti, Home Ministry, Domestic Trade, Communications and Multimedia, Housing and Local Government (just to name a few)\n\nI am not sure if a gag order has been issued by the prime minister to disallow ministers other than Ismail Sabri to have press briefings for the full MCO. But given the current confusion over the SOPs, shouldn\u2019t the ministers from the key ministries (as suggested above) organise a joint press conference to clear the air? We wait with bated breath for this to happen.\n\nONG KIAN MING is the DAP MP for Bangi and a former deputy minister of international trade and industry.", "keyword": ["sops", "lockdown", "dont",

agreed to be included in the Economic Frontliners Vaccination Programme (retail sector) and have employees at their outlets get vaccinated.\n\nShopping centres are currently applying to Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) to host vaccination centres (PPV) on their premises so retailers can sign up for on-site vaccination.\n\nCentral i-City Shopping Centre chief operating officer Anthony Dylan said 65% of its tenants supported the initiative.\n\n\u201cWe are hoping at least 70% of the mall\u2019s tenants will register with us as we play our part in achieving herd immunity as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cWe are proposing one floor of the carpark to be designated as a vaccination centre, with drive-through function.\n\n\u201cThe location is an alternative to event halls and large-scale venues to get the vaccination done.\n\n\u201cIt is conducive with natural ventilation, proper ingress and egress ramps for drive-through as well as as a suitable location nearby to store the vaccine in accordance with government requirements.\u201d\n\nCapitaLand, which manages seven malls namely 3 Damansara, Melawati Mall, The Mines and Sungei Wang Plaza in Klang Valley, Gurney Plaza as well as Queensbay Mall in Penang and East Coast Mall in Kuantan (Pahang), had also written to the authorities to consider using three of its malls as vaccination centres.\n\n\u201cWe are awaiting further clarifications from the authorities on costs and operational requirements.\n\n\u201cWe have communicated with our tenants to take part in this programme, \u201d said CapitaLand Malaysia Retail head Eddie Lim.\n\n\n\nLim: Over 80% of tenants at malls managed by CapitaLand want to sign up for the vaccination programme for retail frontliners.\n\n\u201cMore than 80% of our tenants are interested to sign up for the vaccination programme for retail frontliners.\n\n\u201cAs our malls remain open during this period, the vaccination exercise will help protect the health and well-being of our shoppers, tenants and staff.\n\n\u201cOur aim is to help the government look at different ideas for decentralisation and expedite the whole vaccination process, \u201d he said.\n\nSunway Malls and Theme Parks chief executive officer HC Chan said Sunway Malls planned to join the PPV drive rolled out by the government.\n\n\u201cThis is still in the early stages and we applaud the government\u2019s efforts to speed up vaccination by opening multiple channels across public and private sectors.\n\n\u201cThe road to recovery hinges on how fast and how wide the vaccination reaches the population.\n\n\u201cSunway had rolled out the first private large-scale vaccination centre for frontliners and the general population in Petaling district since March 2021 at Sunway Pyramid Convention Centre.\n\n\u201cSunway Malls has a staff strength of 12,000.\n\n\u201cThese retail frontliners, especially those in the essential sectors such as supermarket, convenience stores, food and beverage operators as well as pharmacies are in contact with the public daily, thus it is important that they get vaccinated as soon as possible to protect themselves and visitors.\n\n\n\nChan: Sunway Malls and Theme Parks\u2019 ultimate aim is to work with the government to achieve herd immunity as fast as possible.\n\n\u201cOur ultimate aim is to work closely with the government to achieve herd immunity as fast as possible, \u201d he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Bangsar Village 2 could be used as a vaccination centre for workers in the Telawi commercial area.Eng Lian Enterprise Sdn Bhd, which manages Bangsar Village 1,2 and 3 apart from some commercial lots in the area, has offered space for a vaccination centre.\n\nIts leasing manager Vincent Siow said the company had identified a vacant lot on the third floor of Bangsar Village 2 to be used for a vaccination exercise.\n\nNot only would it benefit its retailers\u2019 staff, he said the management had also proposed to include workers in the Telawi commercial centre.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to work with the Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) and KPDNHEP to propose Bangsar Village 2 as a vaccination centre to speed up the national vaccination programme.\n\n\u201cThe response from retailers has been encouraging.\n\n\u201cIf all goes well, we expect about 4,000 workers to receive their vaccination here, \u201d he said.\n\nSuria KLCC in Kuala Lumpur is another mall offering to be a vaccination centre.\n\nSuria KLCC Sdn Bhd, which manages the mall, issued a letter to its retailers on May 31 to submit names of employees interested to be inoculated at the premises by June 1.\n\nThe letter stated that the vaccination exercise will begin sometime this month.\n\n\n\nMost of the tenants at Sunway Pyramid in Petaling Jaya are eager to get their staff vaccinated under the Economic Frontliners Vaccination Programme (retail sector). \u2014 FAIHAN GHANI/The Star\n\nThe tenants that StarMetro spoke to at various malls said they were supportive of the vaccination initiative despite a nominal fee being charged to tenants.\n\nCaring Pharmacy senior pharmacy practice executive Ng Yi Ling said the company was supportive of the programme for shopping centres to be vaccination centres for their retailers.\n\n\u201cOur staff at Caring outlets nationwide are retail frontliners who deal with a huge number of customers, so they are exposed to a certain level of risk during this Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cVaccination for our staff is the best way to protect themselves and at the same time, boosts customer confidence when patronising our stores.\n\n\u201cIt is also geared towards achieving herd immunity the soonest possible.\n\n\u201cCaring encourages all our staff to be vaccinated once the request to set up a vaccination centre in malls is approved by the government, \u201d she told StarMetro.The pharmacy currently has 144 outlets nationwide with more than 1,100 staff, including pharmacists.\n\nNg opined that a small fee charged to tenants in order to get their workers vaccinated was reasonable.\n\n\u201cThe company is willing to chip in as part of its responsibility to get as many employees as we can vaccinated, \u201d she said.\n\n\n\nBangsar Village 2 management has offered to use a vacant lot on its third floor as a vaccination centre not only for mall staff but also for workers in the Telawi commercial area.\n\nDin Tai Fung Malaysia business development director Jeffrey Lim said all its restaurant employees, excluding pregnant women and those with allergies, were supportive of the programme and wanted to get vaccinated as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cOur 11 restaurants nationwide serve customers on a daily basis and we are very heartened to be considered as frontliners.\n\n\u201cWe believe that we can do our part in flattening the curve by getting vaccinated.\n\n\u201cThe company is also bearing the costs for our employees to ensure their safety, \u201d he said.\n\nTGV Cinemas sales and marketing general manager Mohit Bhargava said the company was fully supportive of the initiative.\n\n\u201cWe have enlisted our staff as part of the vaccination programme being rolled out at the shopping centres where we are tenants.\n\n\u201cIt is a collective effort to achieve herd immunity and definitely our frontline staff\u2019s safety is our priority,

Ministry (KPDNHEP) and the Finance Ministry have allocated RM600 million this year compared to last year\u2019s RM528 million for the Cooking Oil Stabilisation Scheme (COSS).\n\nKPDNHEP Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi said his ministry is in discussions with several other ministries and agencies related to improving the price implementation mechanism for subsidised and non-subsidised cooking oil in the market to reduce consumers\u2019 burden.\n\n\u201cThe government will inform the outcome of the discussions and the agreed mechanism,\u201d Nanta Linggi said in a statement.\n\nCOSS is a cooking oil subsidy programme aimed at alleviating consumers\u2019 cost of living, applicable to all groups.\n\nNanta Linggi said the subsidy is given to 1kg cooking oil packed in polybags and offered to consumers at RM2.50 per packet despite the price of crude palm oil (CPO) at the world market currently increasing.\n\n\u201cThe government has allocated 60,000 metric tonnes (MT) per month (or 720,000MT per year) which is equivalent to 60 million polybags per month (720 million polybags per year) for all Malaysians.\n\n\u201cThis is based on a consumption rate of 1.8kg per person per month (22kg per person per year),\u201d he said, adding that the government guarantees the quality of subsidised cooking oil sold in polybags are the same as those sold in bottles, as some are manufactured at the same factory.\n\nMeanwhile, cooking oil sold in plastic bottles and cans (2kg, 3kg, 5kg and 17kg) are not subsidised as the prices are determined by the CPO price at the world market.\n\n\u201cPeople have the choice to buy subsidised cooking oil in 1kg polybags or the unsubsidised ones in bottles and cans,\u201d the minister said.\n\nCurrently, the CPO price in the world market has reached more than RM4,500 per MT compared to around RM2,500 per MT before, which is equivalent to approximately RM4.50 per kg before being processed and bottled.\n\nThis means that CPO\u2019s cost alone, before packaged, is already more than RM22 for 5kg, excluding other costs such as processing, bottling, transportation and profits at all levels of factories, wholesalers, distributors and retailers.\n\nNanta Linggi said KPDNHEP enforcement is consistently monitoring the supply and price of goods in the market.\n\n\u201cThe enforcement will not hesitate to take action

industries that use vaccines provided for free from the government.\n\nVaccine Minister Khairy Jamaluddin said today that CITF is working with various ministries, including the International Trade and Industry Ministry (MITI), Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP), Ministry of Tourism, Arts & Culture (MOTAC), Ministry of Works (KKR), and other government agencies to inoculate economic frontliners in the country.\n\nAt the same time, Khairy, who acknowledged a wide range of charges that are being imposed by companies and industries for vaccine administration costs, said that CITF will set a ceiling price for those charges.\n\n\u201cSo CITF is working together with the relevant agencies to set a schedule of fair and reasonable charges that will be borne by industries and companies that participate in the PPV (public-private vaccination) industrial programme,\u201d Khairy said in a joint press conference today with Health Minister Dr Adham Baba.\n\n\u201cThis is above and beyond the charges paid to ProtectHealth to cover the private health care organisers. This includes the hall rental and all the logistics that are necessary.\u201d\n\nEarlier, CodeBlue reported that the shopping malls are paying to the Ministry of Health (MOH)-owned ProtectHealth Corporation for on-site vaccination programmes.\n\nThe Malaysia Shopping Malls Association (PPK) said that from the total of RM50 fee per person for two doses at on-site vaccination in malls, RM30 would go to ProtectHealth. However, ProtectHealth denied collecting payments from shopping centres purportedly rolling out Covid-19 inoculation drives with vaccinators from ProtectHealth.\n\nBut Khairy today said that the industries will absorb other additional costs of on-site vaccination programmes, except the cost of vaccines itself that will be supplied to industries at no cost from the government\u2019s National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme (PICK).\n\n\u201cSecondly, the industries will bear the cost of administering the vaccination. That will include the payment made to the health care organisations that are organised via ProtectHealth Corporation, which is a fully owned company of MOH,\u201d Khairy said.\n\n\u201cNow the other charges for rental of premises and other services \u2014 this is where there are inconsistencies in terms of the additional charges.\u201d\n\nKhairy also announced that the industrial Covid-19 vaccination programme will start on June 16 in Pengerang, Johor, for workers in oil and gas company Petronas.\n\n\u201cWe have identified the Pengerang Complex as a high-risk area and we will be starting our PPV industries for employees in Petronas complex in Pengerang on 16th of June and the others to follow.\u201d\n\nUnlike the industrial Covid-19 vaccination programme, the Malaysian government has been covering the cost of administering vaccines, as the government-owned ProtectHealth pays private medical practitioners RM14 per dose for their inoculation services under PICK that has also utilised private health care facilities as vaccination centres. Both the industrial inoculation drive and PICK use vaccines supplied from the government.\n\nRecently, the government of India announced that private hospitals in the country will only be allowed to charge a maximum \u201cservice charge\u201d of 150 rupees (RM8.49) per dose in a fixed price of the jabs.\n\nThe Indian government said that it will provide Covid-19 vaccinations for free to all adults aged 18 and older from June 21, reversing an earlier decision that allowed states to procure their own vaccine supplies to vaccinate those aged between 18 and 44.\n\nKhairy also said today that the economic frontliners\u2019 vaccination programme will include a wide range of industries in order to pave the way for them to continue operating during movement control orders (MCO) in the country.\n\n\u201cThe arrangement or the discussions that we have been having with various industries, whether they are manufacturing, construction, retail, hospitality, is that if they would like to facilitate the vaccination of their employees, seeing some of these industries operate during the MCOs, we can proceed on a public-private partnership.\u201d", "keyword": ["fix", "vaccination", "ceiling", "khairy", "vaccines", "price", "cost", "industries", "protecthealth", "ministry", "programmes", "covid19", "health", "citf", "programme", "industrial"], "summary": "Khairy Jamaluddin says industries will absorb all additional costs of on-site Covid-19 vaccination programmes, including paying government-owned ProtectHealth Corporation, except the cost of vaccines itself that are provided free by the government.\nKUALA LUMPUR, June 9 \u2014 The Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) will set a ceiling price on vaccine administration charges under the Covid-19 inoculation programme for industries that use vaccines provided for free from the government.\nThis includes the hall rental and all the logistics that are necessary.\u201dEarlier, CodeBlue reported that the shopping malls are paying to the Ministry of Health (MOH)-owned ProtectHealth Corporation for on-site vaccination programmes.\nHowever, ProtectHealth denied collecting payments from shopping centres purportedly rolling out Covid-19 inoculation drives with vaccinators from ProtectHealth.\n\u201cNow the other charges for rental of premises and other services \u2014 this is where there are inconsistencies in terms of the additional charges.\u201dKhairy also announced that the industrial Covid-19 vaccination programme will start on June 16 in Pengerang, Johor, for workers in oil and gas company Petronas.", "news": "CodeBlue", "date": "2021-06-09 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Did MDCC President Catch MITI In A Gaffe?", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wNi8xMi9kaWQtbWRjYy1wcmVzaWRlbnQtY2F0Y2gtbWl0aS1pbi1hLWdhZmZlL9IBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wNi8xMi9kaWQtbWRjYy1wcmVzaWRlbnQtY2F0Y2gtbWl0aS1pbi1hLWdhZmZlL2FtcC8?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Azizul Rahman Ismail", "Maya Suraya"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dyana-wing-so-PAfM5FQ1Drk-unsplash.jpg", "text": "Subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates.\n\nIt began with a Twitter post by Malaysia Digital Chamber of Commerce (MDCC) president, Chris Daniel Wong, of a letter of permission by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI).

This list has not been published.\n\nWe need to know this information even though the issuing of approval letters has gone back to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti)'s Cims 3.0 system. This is because the approvals still have to come from the respective ministries and there is still confusion among the ministries themselves as to which sectors they are responsible for.\n\n2) We still don\u2019t know if restaurants are allowed to operate if they have not gotten an approval letter from Miti\n\nOne example is restaurants. Although food and beverages (F&B) are considered essential items and F&B is considered an essential industry, it is unclear which ministry is responsible for approving the continued operations of the many thousands of restaurants in the entire country.\n\nThe Ministry of Housing and Local Government (KPKT) has said that hawkers only need to produce their license from the local authority to operate and will not have to wait for the Miti letter to continue to operate. But this has not stopped some irresponsible enforcement officers from pressuring hawkers into showing their Miti letter.\n\nSome restaurants continue to remain closed even for takeaway meals because they have not gotten their Miti approval letter yet. I have received some reports that the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) thinks that only franchise restaurants come under its purview but not the non-franchise restaurants. The National Security Council (NSC) has not clarified this issue at the time of writing.\n\n3) We don\u2019t know if those operating roadside stalls selling food and drinks can continue to operate without an approval letter from Miti\n\nThis is similar to the point above except that some of these stalls don\u2019t operate with a valid license from the local authority. But how about those who have been given a temporary license to operate by the local authorities in KL and Selangor, for example, during the Covid-19 pandemic? Can they continue to operate? Are the enforcement officers clear on this policy?\n\n4) We don\u2019t know what criteria was used to ban the sale of alcohol but allow the sale of cigarettes\n\nThe Deputy Minister of Trade and Consumer Affairs was reported to have said that the sale of alcohol was banned because it is considered as a non-essential item but the sale of cigarettes would continue to be allowed to cater for the \u201ccigarette addicts\u201d.\n\nLater on, Senior Minister (Security) Ismail Sabri Yaakob expressed his confusion over this statement since shops that sell beer such as 7-11 were still being allowed to operate. Some supermarkets then closed down the section of their operations selling beer and other alcoholic beverages to comply with the \u2018instruction\u2019 from the deputy minister. The Minister of Domestic Trade has not issued any public statement on this issue, as far as I know.\n\nI am not advocating for a ban on cigarettes. What I am asking, like many other Malaysians, is consistency and clarity in government policies on the part of the government.\n\nIf the production and sale of alcohol are banned during the full MCO, has the government considered that opportunists will take the opportunity to make and sell illegal alcohol which will be much more dangerous to consumers? Or have we forgotten the deaths of those through methanol poisoning by consuming cheap and illegal alcohol back in 2019?\n\n5) We still don\u2019t know if automotive/car workshops are allowed to operate if they have not gotten an approval letter from Miti\n\nEven though car workshops are listed as essential under the distributive trade category, it is still unclear which is the ministry that is supposed to give approval for these workshops to continue to operate.\n\nThe Ministry of Transport does not list auto workshops under the sectors that are under its jurisdiction for approval in its Smile application system. The Ministry of Domestic Trade is maintaining an elegant silence on this issue.\n\nSo many car workshops continue to remain closed. This means that those in the logistics sector needing servicing may face some challenges. And those who need to drive to work because they are working in the essential services sector must hope and pray their cars or motorcycles don\u2019t break down or require major servicing.\n\n6) We don\u2019t know if those who are in the distributive trade sector and supplying the essential services are allowed to operate and from which ministry do they seek approval from\n\nI know of someone who imports various types of PPE equipment to supply to the hospitals and Covid-19 quarantine centres in Malaysia. Without getting approval to operate, his company would not have been able to continue the supply of these essential items to the Ministry of Health.\n\nHe tried applying to the Ministry of Domestic Trade but the website and later, the Google form application, crashed. After trying various options, I was made to understand that his approval was finally granted. I am still unsure as to which was the approving ministry for his particular sector of the economy.\n\n7) We don\u2019t know if air-con maintenance and repair are allowed to operate and from which ministry they should seek approval to operate from\n\nCritical maintenance and repair are listed as one of the 17 essential services during the full MCO but I think it only applies to the construction sector. What about other maintenance and service operations that are critical for the continued operations of other essential sectors?\n\nFor example, if the air-conditioning system at a hospital breaks down, we need those in the air-conditioning service sector to do their repair work. For factories producing food and beverages, they also need their air circulation system to be maintained.\n\nIn fact, one can say that given the airborne nature of the Covid-10 virus, the air-conditioning sector should be considered as essential especially for the servicing of commercial (including factories) and government buildings. We are also unsure which ministry the air-con sector comes under.\n\n8) We don\u2019t know if plumbers are allowed to operate and from which ministry they should seek approval to operate from\n\nPlumbers are also important to ensure that the toilets in hospitals, factories, offices, and government buildings are \u201cflowing\u201d smoothly. But which ministry is in charge of approving plumbers to continue to operate under full MCO?\n\n9) We don\u2019t know if those servicing photocopiers and printers are allowed to operate and from which ministry they need to seek approval from\n\nI also received a request from a company whose sales and marketing arm services the photocopiers and provides printing paper to many government ministries and agencies including the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Finance.\n\nIf such companies are not allowed to operate, the ministries and even hospitals, may not have the required paper to print their documents on and also would not be able to have access to photocopiers and printers which have broken down and are being left unrepaired during the full MCO.\n\n10) We don\u2019t know what criteria are being used to approve or not to approve those who are in the essential services supply chain\n\nThere should have been a clear mapping and understanding of the sectors and companies which are critical to the continued operations of the essential services sectors. This can be used as the basis of approving, not approving, or approving at a much-reduced capacity, companies that are part of this supply chain.\n\nAs of today, we have not seen such a mapping or heard any explanations from any minister with regard to the bigger picture surrounding the supply chain for essential services.\n\n11) We don\u2019t know how children are going to learn online when computer and telco shops are closed and the stationery section in the supermarkets are shut down\n\nThe Minister of Education recently announced that classes will continue to remain online when school reopens on June 13 and 14. But many parents who want to repair their laptops and handphones used by their children for online learning at home cannot do so because all of these services are shut down during the full MCO.\n\nEven stationery sections of some supermarkets have been shut down, preventing parents from even buying stationery for their children to use at home.\n\n12) We don\u2019t know how people are supposed to Work From Home (WFH) if their laptops break down and their phones are damaged but IT and handphone shops are closed\n\nSimilarly, for those who have to work from home using their laptops and handphones, they better hope their devices don\u2019t break down during the full MCO since none of the places which repair these devices are open.\n\n(I had a problem with my laptop which could only be fixed at the HQ of the company and I was informed that this could only be done after the end of the full MCO. Thankfully I have the resources to buy a new laptop but what about those who don\u2019t have the funds to buy a laptop during such an emergency?)\n\n13) We don\u2019t know how those people who seek treatments from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) can continue to seek such treatments\n\nI was also told that those seeking treatments from TCM shops cannot do so during the full MCO. The operators of the TCM shops cannot even go to their shops to pack packages of herbs to send to their customers as they are not considered an essential service even though they provide health and other related relief to their customers.\n\n14) We don\u2019t know why hair colouring is not allowed to be sold at pharmacies\n\nApparently, some pharmacies sealed up the section of their stores selling hair colouring as it is deemed as a non-essential item. I cannot understand why the selling of hair colouring at a pharmacy that is already open can be detrimental to our overall fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n15) We don\u2019t know why the home improvement section in some shops e.g. Mr DIY are not allowed to be opened\n\nApparently, some sections of hardware shops that sell home improvement products have been cordoned off. I received a report via a tweet that a person couldn\u2019t buy \u201chooks\u201d for his bathroom from Mr DIY because this section had been cordoned off.\n\n16) We don\u2019t know how people are going to cook at home if some of their home appliances break down since electrical appliance stores are not opened and the sections selling some of these items in supermarkets are closed (e.g. rice cookers and kettles)\n\nHousehold appliances such as rice cookers and kettles have their shelf life. Some may short circuit during the full MCO because of overuse. But we may not be able to buy their replacements because those shops selling electrical appliances are not open and the sections selling some of these items in some supermarkets have been cordoned off.\n\nOf course, there is the option of buying these items online but delivery may take a few days and for some of the semi-urban areas, the preferred option would still be to go to the physical store to procure these items.\n\n17) We don\u2019t know how companies that are in non-essential sectors can continue to maintain their data centres in case of emergencies\n\nI know of a company that is in the non-essential sector but has an important data centre that stores and processes critical information to the financial services sector. For these companies, they need to have one or two people on standby to access the data center in case there is an emergency or if the server breaks down (for whatever reason).\n\nIs MDEC, the agency under the Ministry of Multimedia and Communications, that is in charge of data centre operations, aware of such issues happening?\n\n18) We cannot understand why some companies were issued letters of approval by Miti but when the QR code for the company is scanned by the police, the details reveal that it is considered as a non-essential industry\n\nThis is a bit of a technical issue but is important in terms of preventing companies and their staff from being unfairly fined. Some companies which are listed as essential services suddenly find that they are not classified as an essential service when the QR code on their Miti letter is scanned by the authorities including the police.\n\nThis means that the employees of companies with this sort of letter can potentially be fined thousands of ringgit for violating the full MCO. The photos above show information from an optometrist which is not classified as essential under the QR code scan even though a letter from Miti has been issued to allow this optometrist to continue to operate under the full MCO.\n\n19) We still don\u2019t understand why jogging is allowed but cycling is banned\n\nI appreciate the fact that jogging and exercising alone in our residential areas are still permitted. But I fail to understand why cycling alone is not permitted, especially if this person is cycling within a 10km radius of his or her home.\n\nFurthermore, some people actually cycle to work (including some factory workers in my constituency) and some people cycle to the morning market to do their grocery shopping. Will they be fined for cycling by the enforcement authorities?\n\n20) We still haven\u2019t heard the following ministers come together and separately give a press briefing on the sectors under their jurisdiction - Miti, Home Ministry, Domestic Trade, Communications and Multimedia, Housing and Local Government (just to name a few)\n\nI am not sure if a gag order has been issued by the prime minister to disallow ministers other than Ismail Sabri to have press briefings for the full MCO. But given the current confusion over the SOPs, shouldn\u2019t the ministers from the key ministries (as suggested above) organise a joint press conference to clear the air? We wait with bated breath for this to happen.\n\nONG KIAN MING is the DAP MP for Bangi and a former deputy minister of international trade and industry.", "keyword": ["sops", "lockdown", "dont",

agreed to be included in the Economic Frontliners Vaccination Programme (retail sector) and have employees at their outlets get vaccinated.\n\nShopping centres are currently applying to Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) to host vaccination centres (PPV) on their premises so retailers can sign up for on-site vaccination.\n\nCentral i-City Shopping Centre chief operating officer Anthony Dylan said 65% of its tenants supported the initiative.\n\n\u201cWe are hoping at least 70% of the mall\u2019s tenants will register with us as we play our part in achieving herd immunity as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cWe are proposing one floor of the carpark to be designated as a vaccination centre, with drive-through function.\n\n\u201cThe location is an alternative to event halls and large-scale venues to get the vaccination done.\n\n\u201cIt is conducive with natural ventilation, proper ingress and egress ramps for drive-through as well as as a suitable location nearby to store the vaccine in accordance with government requirements.\u201d\n\nCapitaLand, which manages seven malls namely 3 Damansara, Melawati Mall, The Mines and Sungei Wang Plaza in Klang Valley, Gurney Plaza as well as Queensbay Mall in Penang and East Coast Mall in Kuantan (Pahang), had also written to the authorities to consider using three of its malls as vaccination centres.\n\n\u201cWe are awaiting further clarifications from the authorities on costs and operational requirements.\n\n\u201cWe have communicated with our tenants to take part in this programme, \u201d said CapitaLand Malaysia Retail head Eddie Lim.\n\n\n\nLim: Over 80% of tenants at malls managed by CapitaLand want to sign up for the vaccination programme for retail frontliners.\n\n\u201cMore than 80% of our tenants are interested to sign up for the vaccination programme for retail frontliners.\n\n\u201cAs our malls remain open during this period, the vaccination exercise will help protect the health and well-being of our shoppers, tenants and staff.\n\n\u201cOur aim is to help the government look at different ideas for decentralisation and expedite the whole vaccination process, \u201d he said.\n\nSunway Malls and Theme Parks chief executive officer HC Chan said Sunway Malls planned to join the PPV drive rolled out by the government.\n\n\u201cThis is still in the early stages and we applaud the government\u2019s efforts to speed up vaccination by opening multiple channels across public and private sectors.\n\n\u201cThe road to recovery hinges on how fast and how wide the vaccination reaches the population.\n\n\u201cSunway had rolled out the first private large-scale vaccination centre for frontliners and the general population in Petaling district since March 2021 at Sunway Pyramid Convention Centre.\n\n\u201cSunway Malls has a staff strength of 12,000.\n\n\u201cThese retail frontliners, especially those in the essential sectors such as supermarket, convenience stores, food and beverage operators as well as pharmacies are in contact with the public daily, thus it is important that they get vaccinated as soon as possible to protect themselves and visitors.\n\n\n\nChan: Sunway Malls and Theme Parks\u2019 ultimate aim is to work with the government to achieve herd immunity as fast as possible.\n\n\u201cOur ultimate aim is to work closely with the government to achieve herd immunity as fast as possible, \u201d he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Bangsar Village 2 could be used as a vaccination centre for workers in the Telawi commercial area.Eng Lian Enterprise Sdn Bhd, which manages Bangsar Village 1,2 and 3 apart from some commercial lots in the area, has offered space for a vaccination centre.\n\nIts leasing manager Vincent Siow said the company had identified a vacant lot on the third floor of Bangsar Village 2 to be used for a vaccination exercise.\n\nNot only would it benefit its retailers\u2019 staff, he said the management had also proposed to include workers in the Telawi commercial centre.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to work with the Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) and KPDNHEP to propose Bangsar Village 2 as a vaccination centre to speed up the national vaccination programme.\n\n\u201cThe response from retailers has been encouraging.\n\n\u201cIf all goes well, we expect about 4,000 workers to receive their vaccination here, \u201d he said.\n\nSuria KLCC in Kuala Lumpur is another mall offering to be a vaccination centre.\n\nSuria KLCC Sdn Bhd, which manages the mall, issued a letter to its retailers on May 31 to submit names of employees interested to be inoculated at the premises by June 1.\n\nThe letter stated that the vaccination exercise will begin sometime this month.\n\n\n\nMost of the tenants at Sunway Pyramid in Petaling Jaya are eager to get their staff vaccinated under the Economic Frontliners Vaccination Programme (retail sector). \u2014 FAIHAN GHANI/The Star\n\nThe tenants that StarMetro spoke to at various malls said they were supportive of the vaccination initiative despite a nominal fee being charged to tenants.\n\nCaring Pharmacy senior pharmacy practice executive Ng Yi Ling said the company was supportive of the programme for shopping centres to be vaccination centres for their retailers.\n\n\u201cOur staff at Caring outlets nationwide are retail frontliners who deal with a huge number of customers, so they are exposed to a certain level of risk during this Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cVaccination for our staff is the best way to protect themselves and at the same time, boosts customer confidence when patronising our stores.\n\n\u201cIt is also geared towards achieving herd immunity the soonest possible.\n\n\u201cCaring encourages all our staff to be vaccinated once the request to set up a vaccination centre in malls is approved by the government, \u201d she told StarMetro.The pharmacy currently has 144 outlets nationwide with more than 1,100 staff, including pharmacists.\n\nNg opined that a small fee charged to tenants in order to get their workers vaccinated was reasonable.\n\n\u201cThe company is willing to chip in as part of its responsibility to get as many employees as we can vaccinated, \u201d she said.\n\n\n\nBangsar Village 2 management has offered to use a vacant lot on its third floor as a vaccination centre not only for mall staff but also for workers in the Telawi commercial area.\n\nDin Tai Fung Malaysia business development director Jeffrey Lim said all its restaurant employees, excluding pregnant women and those with allergies, were supportive of the programme and wanted to get vaccinated as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cOur 11 restaurants nationwide serve customers on a daily basis and we are very heartened to be considered as frontliners.\n\n\u201cWe believe that we can do our part in flattening the curve by getting vaccinated.\n\n\u201cThe company is also bearing the costs for our employees to ensure their safety, \u201d he said.\n\nTGV Cinemas sales and marketing general manager Mohit Bhargava said the company was fully supportive of the initiative.\n\n\u201cWe have enlisted our staff as part of the vaccination programme being rolled out at the shopping centres where we are tenants.\n\n\u201cIt is a collective effort to achieve herd immunity and definitely our frontline staff\u2019s safety is our priority,

Ministry (KPDNHEP) and the Finance Ministry have allocated RM600 million this year compared to last year\u2019s RM528 million for the Cooking Oil Stabilisation Scheme (COSS).\n\nKPDNHEP Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi said his ministry is in discussions with several other ministries and agencies related to improving the price implementation mechanism for subsidised and non-subsidised cooking oil in the market to reduce consumers\u2019 burden.\n\n\u201cThe government will inform the outcome of the discussions and the agreed mechanism,\u201d Nanta Linggi said in a statement.\n\nCOSS is a cooking oil subsidy programme aimed at alleviating consumers\u2019 cost of living, applicable to all groups.\n\nNanta Linggi said the subsidy is given to 1kg cooking oil packed in polybags and offered to consumers at RM2.50 per packet despite the price of crude palm oil (CPO) at the world market currently increasing.\n\n\u201cThe government has allocated 60,000 metric tonnes (MT) per month (or 720,000MT per year) which is equivalent to 60 million polybags per month (720 million polybags per year) for all Malaysians.\n\n\u201cThis is based on a consumption rate of 1.8kg per person per month (22kg per person per year),\u201d he said, adding that the government guarantees the quality of subsidised cooking oil sold in polybags are the same as those sold in bottles, as some are

industries that use vaccines provided for free from the government.\n\nVaccine Minister Khairy Jamaluddin said today that CITF is working with various ministries, including the International Trade and Industry Ministry (MITI), Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP), Ministry of Tourism, Arts & Culture (MOTAC), Ministry of Works (KKR), and other government agencies to inoculate economic frontliners in the country.\n\nAt the same time, Khairy, who acknowledged a wide range of charges that are being imposed by companies and industries for vaccine administration costs, said that CITF will set a ceiling price for those charges.\n\n\u201cSo CITF is working together with the relevant agencies to set a schedule of fair and reasonable charges that will be borne by industries and companies that participate in the PPV (public-private vaccination) industrial programme,\u201d Khairy said in a joint press conference today with Health Minister Dr Adham Baba.\n\n\u201cThis is above and beyond the charges paid to ProtectHealth to cover the private health care organisers. This includes the hall rental and all the logistics that are necessary.\u201d\n\nEarlier, CodeBlue reported that the shopping malls are paying to the Ministry of Health (MOH)-owned ProtectHealth Corporation for on-site vaccination programmes.\n\nThe Malaysia Shopping Malls Association (PPK) said that from the total of RM50 fee per person for two doses at on-site vaccination in malls, RM30 would go to ProtectHealth. However, ProtectHealth denied collecting payments from shopping centres purportedly rolling out Covid-19 inoculation drives with vaccinators from ProtectHealth.\n\nBut Khairy today said that the industries will absorb other additional costs of on-site vaccination programmes, except the cost of vaccines itself that will be supplied to industries at no cost from the government\u2019s National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme (PICK).\n\n\u201cSecondly, the industries will bear the cost of administering the vaccination. That will include the payment made to the health care organisations that are organised via ProtectHealth Corporation, which is a fully owned company of MOH,\u201d Khairy said.\n\n\u201cNow the other charges for rental of premises and other services \u2014 this is where there are inconsistencies in terms of the additional charges.\u201d\n\nKhairy also announced that the industrial Covid-19 vaccination programme will start on June 16 in Pengerang, Johor, for workers in oil and gas company Petronas.\n\n\u201cWe have identified the Pengerang Complex as a high-risk area and we will be starting our PPV industries for employees in Petronas complex in Pengerang on 16th of June and the others to follow.\u201d\n\nUnlike the industrial Covid-19 vaccination programme, the Malaysian government has been covering the cost of administering vaccines, as the government-owned ProtectHealth pays private medical practitioners RM14 per dose for their inoculation services under PICK that has also utilised private health care facilities as vaccination centres. Both the industrial inoculation drive and PICK use vaccines supplied from the government.\n\nRecently, the government of India announced that private hospitals in the country will only be allowed to charge a maximum \u201cservice charge\u201d of 150 rupees (RM8.49) per dose in a fixed price of the jabs.\n\nThe Indian government said that it will provide Covid-19 vaccinations for free to all adults aged 18 and older from June 21, reversing an earlier decision that allowed states to procure their own vaccine supplies to vaccinate those aged between 18 and 44.\n\nKhairy also said today that the economic frontliners\u2019 vaccination programme will include a wide range of industries in order to pave the way for them to continue operating during movement control orders (MCO) in the country.\n\n\u201cThe arrangement or the discussions that we have been having with various industries, whether they are manufacturing, construction, retail, hospitality, is that if they would like to facilitate the vaccination of their employees, seeing some of these industries operate during the MCOs, we can proceed on a public-private partnership.\u201d", "keyword": ["fix", "vaccination", "ceiling", "khairy", "vaccines", "price", "cost", "industries", "protecthealth", "ministry", "programmes", "covid19", "health", "citf", "programme", "industrial"], "summary": "Khairy Jamaluddin says industries will absorb all additional costs of on-site Covid-19 vaccination programmes, including paying government-owned ProtectHealth Corporation, except the cost of vaccines itself that are provided free by the government.\nKUALA LUMPUR, June 9 \u2014 The Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) will set a ceiling price on vaccine administration charges under the Covid-19 inoculation programme for industries that use vaccines provided for free from the government.\nThis includes the hall rental and all the logistics that are necessary.\u201dEarlier, CodeBlue reported that the shopping malls are paying to the Ministry of Health (MOH)-owned ProtectHealth Corporation for on-site vaccination programmes.\nHowever, ProtectHealth denied collecting payments from shopping centres purportedly rolling out Covid-19 inoculation drives with vaccinators from ProtectHealth.\n\u201cNow the other charges for rental of premises and other services \u2014 this is where there are inconsistencies in terms of the additional charges.\u201dKhairy also announced that the industrial Covid-19 vaccination programme will start on June 16 in Pengerang, Johor, for workers in oil and gas company Petronas.", "news": "CodeBlue", "date": "2021-06-09 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Did MDCC President Catch MITI In A Gaffe?", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wNi8xMi9kaWQtbWRjYy1wcmVzaWRlbnQtY2F0Y2gtbWl0aS1pbi1hLWdhZmZlL9IBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wNi8xMi9kaWQtbWRjYy1wcmVzaWRlbnQtY2F0Y2gtbWl0aS1pbi1hLWdhZmZlL2FtcC8?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Azizul Rahman Ismail", "Maya Suraya"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dyana-wing-so-PAfM5FQ1Drk-unsplash.jpg", "text": "Subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates.\n\nIt began with a Twitter post by Malaysia Digital Chamber of Commerce (MDCC) president, Chris Daniel Wong, of a letter of permission by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI).

Here is a list of issues I compiled based on media reports and social media postings over the past week.\n\n20 issues we are still unsure about a week into the full MCO:\n\n1) We still don\u2019t have a comprehensive list of which sectors or industries are under the jurisdiction of which ministry.\n\nWhen the full MCO was announced, I issued a statement asking the PN government to make public a comprehensive list of the different sectors of the economy and which ministries are responsible for overseeing them. This list has not been published.\n\nWe need to know this information even though the issuing of approval letters has gone back to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti)'s Cims 3.0 system. This is because the approvals still have to come from the respective ministries and there is still confusion among the ministries themselves as to which sectors they are responsible for.\n\n2) We still don\u2019t know if restaurants are allowed to operate if they have not gotten an approval letter from Miti\n\nOne example is restaurants. Although food and beverages (F&B) are considered essential items and F&B is considered an essential industry, it is unclear which ministry is responsible for approving the continued operations of the many thousands of restaurants in the entire country.\n\nThe Ministry of Housing and Local Government (KPKT) has said that hawkers only need to produce their license from the local authority to operate and will not have to wait for the Miti letter to continue to operate. But this has not stopped some irresponsible enforcement officers from pressuring hawkers into showing their Miti letter.\n\nSome restaurants continue to remain closed even for takeaway meals because they have not gotten their Miti approval letter yet. I have received some reports that the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) thinks that only franchise restaurants come under its purview but not the non-franchise restaurants. The National Security Council (NSC) has not clarified this issue at the time of writing.\n\n3) We don\u2019t know if those operating roadside stalls selling food and drinks can continue to operate without an approval letter from Miti\n\nThis is similar to the point above except that some of these stalls don\u2019t operate with a valid license from the local authority. But how about those who have been given a temporary license to operate by the local authorities in KL and Selangor, for example, during the Covid-19 pandemic? Can they continue to operate? Are the enforcement officers clear on this policy?\n\n4) We don\u2019t know what criteria was used to ban the sale of alcohol but allow the sale of cigarettes\n\nThe Deputy Minister of Trade and Consumer Affairs was reported to have said that the sale of alcohol was banned because it is considered as a non-essential item but the sale of cigarettes would continue to be allowed to cater for the \u201ccigarette addicts\u201d.\n\nLater on, Senior Minister (Security) Ismail Sabri Yaakob expressed his confusion over this statement since shops that sell beer such as 7-11 were still being allowed to operate. Some supermarkets then closed down the section of their operations selling beer and other alcoholic beverages to comply with the \u2018instruction\u2019 from the deputy minister. The Minister of Domestic Trade has not issued any public statement on this issue, as far as I know.\n\nI am not advocating for a ban on cigarettes. What I am asking, like many other Malaysians, is consistency and clarity in government policies on the part of the government.\n\nIf the production and sale of alcohol are banned during the full MCO, has the government considered that opportunists will take the opportunity to make and sell illegal alcohol which will be much more dangerous to consumers? Or have we forgotten the deaths of those through methanol poisoning by consuming cheap and illegal alcohol back in 2019?\n\n5) We still don\u2019t know if automotive/car workshops are allowed to operate if they have not gotten an approval letter from Miti\n\nEven though car workshops are listed as essential under the distributive trade category, it is still unclear which is the ministry that is supposed to give approval for these workshops to continue to operate.\n\nThe Ministry of Transport does not list auto workshops under the sectors that are under its jurisdiction for approval in its Smile application system. The Ministry of Domestic Trade is maintaining an elegant silence on this issue.\n\nSo many car workshops continue to remain closed. This means that those in the logistics sector needing servicing may face some challenges. And those who need to drive to work because they are working in the essential services sector must hope and pray their cars or motorcycles don\u2019t break down or require major servicing.\n\n6) We don\u2019t know if those who are in the distributive trade sector and supplying the essential services are allowed to operate and from which ministry do they seek approval from\n\nI know of someone who imports various types of PPE equipment to supply to the hospitals and Covid-19 quarantine centres in Malaysia. Without getting approval to operate, his company would not have been able to continue the supply of these essential items to the Ministry of Health.\n\nHe tried applying to the Ministry of Domestic Trade but the website and later, the Google form application, crashed. After trying various options, I was made to understand that his approval was finally granted. I am still unsure as to which was the approving ministry for his particular sector of the economy.\n\n7) We don\u2019t know if air-con maintenance and repair are allowed to operate and from which ministry they should seek approval to operate from\n\nCritical maintenance and repair are listed as one of the 17 essential services during the full MCO but I think it only applies to the construction sector. What about other maintenance and service operations that are critical for the continued operations of other essential sectors?\n\nFor example, if the air-conditioning system at a hospital breaks down, we need those in the air-conditioning service sector to do their repair work. For factories producing food and beverages, they also need their air circulation system to be maintained.\n\nIn fact, one can say that given the airborne nature of the Covid-10 virus, the air-conditioning sector should be considered as essential especially for the servicing of commercial (including factories) and government buildings. We are also unsure which ministry the air-con sector comes under.\n\n8) We don\u2019t know if plumbers are allowed to operate and from which ministry they should seek approval to operate from\n\nPlumbers are also important to ensure that the toilets in hospitals, factories, offices, and government buildings are \u201cflowing\u201d smoothly. But which ministry is in charge of approving plumbers to continue to operate under full MCO?\n\n9) We don\u2019t know if those servicing photocopiers and printers are allowed to operate and from which ministry they need to seek approval from\n\nI also received a request from a company whose sales and marketing arm services the photocopiers and provides printing paper to many government ministries and agencies including the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Finance.\n\nIf such companies are not allowed to operate, the ministries and even hospitals, may not have the required paper to print their documents on and also would not be able to have access to photocopiers and printers which have broken down and are being left unrepaired during the full MCO.\n\n10) We don\u2019t know what criteria are being used to approve or not to approve those who are in the essential services supply chain\n\nThere should have been a clear mapping and understanding of the sectors and companies which are critical to the continued operations of the essential services sectors. This can be used as the basis of approving, not approving, or approving at a much-reduced capacity, companies that are part of this supply chain.\n\nAs of today, we have not seen such a mapping or heard any explanations from any minister with regard to the bigger picture surrounding the supply chain for essential services.\n\n11) We don\u2019t know how children are going to learn online when computer and telco shops are closed and the stationery section in the supermarkets are shut down\n\nThe Minister of Education recently announced that classes will continue to remain online when school reopens on June 13 and 14. But many parents who want to repair their laptops and handphones used by their children for online learning at home cannot do so because all of these services are shut down during the full MCO.\n\nEven stationery sections of some supermarkets have been shut down, preventing parents from even buying stationery for their children to use at home.\n\n12) We don\u2019t know how people are supposed to Work From Home (WFH) if their laptops break down and their phones are damaged but IT and handphone shops are closed\n\nSimilarly, for those who have to work from home using their laptops and handphones, they better hope their devices don\u2019t break down during the full MCO since none of the places which repair these devices are open.\n\n(I had a problem with my laptop which could only be fixed at the HQ of the company and I was informed that this could only be done after the end of the full MCO. Thankfully I have the resources to buy a new laptop but what about those who don\u2019t have the funds to buy a laptop during such an emergency?)\n\n13) We don\u2019t know how those people who seek treatments from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) can continue to seek such treatments\n\nI was also told that those seeking treatments from TCM shops cannot do so during the full MCO. The operators of the TCM shops cannot even go to their shops to pack packages of herbs to send to their customers as they are not considered an essential service even though they provide health and other related relief to their customers.\n\n14) We don\u2019t know why hair colouring is not allowed to be sold at pharmacies\n\nApparently, some pharmacies sealed up the section of their stores selling hair colouring as it is deemed as a non-essential item. I cannot understand why the selling of hair colouring at a pharmacy that is already open can be detrimental to our overall fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n15) We don\u2019t know why the home improvement section in some shops e.g. Mr DIY are not allowed to be opened\n\nApparently, some sections of hardware shops that sell home improvement products have been cordoned off. I received a report via a tweet that a person couldn\u2019t buy \u201chooks\u201d for his bathroom from Mr DIY because this section had been cordoned off.\n\n16) We don\u2019t know how people are going to cook at home if some of their home appliances break down since electrical appliance stores are not opened and the sections selling some of these items in supermarkets are closed (e.g. rice cookers and kettles)\n\nHousehold appliances such as rice cookers and kettles have their shelf life. Some may short circuit during the full MCO because of overuse. But we may not be able to buy their replacements because those shops selling electrical appliances are not open and the sections selling some of these items in some supermarkets have been cordoned off.\n\nOf course, there is the option of buying these items online but delivery may take a few days and for some of the semi-urban areas, the preferred option would still be to go to the physical store to procure these items.\n\n17) We don\u2019t know how companies that are in non-essential sectors can continue to maintain their data centres in case of emergencies\n\nI know of a company that is in the non-essential sector but has an important data centre that stores and processes critical information to the financial services sector. For these companies, they need to have one or two people on standby to access the data center in case there is an emergency or if the server breaks down (for whatever reason).\n\nIs MDEC, the agency under the Ministry of Multimedia and Communications, that is in charge of data centre operations, aware of such issues happening?\n\n18) We cannot understand why some companies were issued letters of approval by Miti but when the QR code for the company is scanned by the police, the details reveal that it is considered as a non-essential industry\n\nThis is a bit of a technical issue but is important in terms of preventing companies and their staff from being unfairly fined. Some companies which are listed as essential services suddenly find that they are not classified as an essential service when the QR code on their Miti letter is scanned by the authorities including the police.\n\nThis means that the employees of companies with this sort of letter can potentially be fined thousands of ringgit for violating the full MCO. The photos above show information from an optometrist which is not classified as essential under the QR code scan even though a letter from Miti has been issued to allow this optometrist to continue to operate under the full MCO.\n\n19) We still don\u2019t understand why jogging is allowed but cycling is banned\n\nI appreciate the fact that jogging and exercising alone in our residential areas are still permitted. But I fail to understand why cycling alone is not permitted, especially if this person is cycling within a 10km radius of his or her home.\n\nFurthermore, some people actually cycle to work (including some factory workers in my constituency) and some people cycle to the morning market to do their grocery shopping. Will they be fined for cycling by the enforcement authorities?\n\n20) We still haven\u2019t heard the following ministers come together and separately give a press briefing on the sectors under their jurisdiction - Miti, Home Ministry, Domestic Trade, Communications and Multimedia, Housing and Local Government (just to name a few)\n\nI am not sure if a gag order has been issued by the prime minister to disallow ministers other than Ismail Sabri to have press briefings for the full MCO. But given the current confusion over the SOPs, shouldn\u2019t the ministers from the key ministries (as suggested above) organise a joint press conference to clear the air? We wait with bated breath for this to happen.\n\nONG KIAN MING is the DAP MP for Bangi and a former deputy minister of international trade and industry.", "keyword": ["sops", "lockdown", "dont",

agreed to be included in the Economic Frontliners Vaccination Programme (retail sector) and have employees at their outlets get vaccinated.\n\nShopping centres are currently applying to Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) to host vaccination centres (PPV) on their premises so retailers can sign up for on-site vaccination.\n\nCentral i-City Shopping Centre chief operating officer Anthony Dylan said 65% of its tenants supported the initiative.\n\n\u201cWe are hoping at least 70% of the mall\u2019s tenants will register with us as we play our part in achieving herd immunity as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cWe are proposing one floor of the carpark to be designated as a vaccination centre, with drive-through function.\n\n\u201cThe location is an alternative to event halls and large-scale venues to get the vaccination done.\n\n\u201cIt is conducive with natural ventilation, proper ingress and egress ramps for drive-through as well as as a suitable location nearby to store the vaccine in accordance with government requirements.\u201d\n\nCapitaLand, which manages seven malls namely 3 Damansara, Melawati Mall, The Mines and Sungei Wang Plaza in Klang Valley, Gurney Plaza as well as Queensbay Mall in Penang and East Coast Mall in Kuantan (Pahang), had also written to the authorities to consider using three of its malls as vaccination centres.\n\n\u201cWe are awaiting further clarifications from the authorities on costs and operational requirements.\n\n\u201cWe have communicated with our tenants to take part in this programme, \u201d said CapitaLand Malaysia Retail head Eddie Lim.\n\n\n\nLim: Over 80% of tenants at malls managed by CapitaLand want to sign up for the vaccination programme for retail frontliners.\n\n\u201cMore than 80% of our tenants are interested to sign up for the vaccination programme for retail frontliners.\n\n\u201cAs our malls remain open during this period, the vaccination exercise will help protect the health and well-being of our shoppers, tenants and staff.\n\n\u201cOur aim is to help the government look at different ideas for decentralisation and expedite the whole vaccination process, \u201d he said.\n\nSunway Malls and Theme Parks chief executive officer HC Chan said Sunway Malls planned to join the PPV drive rolled out by the government.\n\n\u201cThis is still in the early stages and we applaud the government\u2019s efforts to speed up vaccination by opening multiple channels across public and private sectors.\n\n\u201cThe road to recovery hinges on how fast and how wide the vaccination reaches the population.\n\n\u201cSunway had rolled out the first private large-scale vaccination centre for frontliners and the general population in Petaling district since March 2021 at Sunway Pyramid Convention Centre.\n\n\u201cSunway Malls has a staff strength of 12,000.\n\n\u201cThese retail frontliners, especially those in the essential sectors such as supermarket, convenience stores, food and beverage operators as well as pharmacies are in contact with the public daily, thus it is important that they get vaccinated as soon as possible to protect themselves and visitors.\n\n\n\nChan: Sunway Malls and Theme Parks\u2019 ultimate aim is to work with the government to achieve herd immunity as fast as possible.\n\n\u201cOur ultimate aim is to work closely with the government to achieve herd immunity as fast as possible, \u201d he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Bangsar Village 2 could be used as a vaccination centre for workers in the Telawi commercial area.Eng Lian Enterprise Sdn Bhd, which manages Bangsar Village 1,2 and 3 apart from some commercial lots in the area, has offered space for a vaccination centre.\n\nIts leasing manager Vincent Siow said the company had identified a vacant lot on the third floor of Bangsar Village 2 to be used for a vaccination exercise.\n\nNot only would it benefit its retailers\u2019 staff, he said the management had also proposed to include workers in the Telawi commercial centre.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to work with the Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) and KPDNHEP to propose Bangsar Village 2 as a vaccination centre to speed up the national vaccination programme.\n\n\u201cThe response from retailers has been encouraging.\n\n\u201cIf all goes well, we expect about 4,000 workers to receive their vaccination here, \u201d he said.\n\nSuria KLCC in Kuala Lumpur is another mall offering to be a vaccination centre.\n\nSuria KLCC Sdn Bhd, which manages the mall, issued a letter to its retailers on May 31 to submit names of employees interested to be inoculated at the premises by June 1.\n\nThe letter stated that the vaccination exercise will begin sometime this month.\n\n\n\nMost of the tenants at Sunway Pyramid in Petaling Jaya are eager to get their staff vaccinated under the Economic Frontliners Vaccination Programme (retail sector). \u2014 FAIHAN GHANI/The Star\n\nThe tenants that StarMetro spoke to at various malls said they were supportive of the vaccination initiative despite a nominal fee being charged to tenants.\n\nCaring Pharmacy senior pharmacy practice executive Ng Yi Ling said the company was supportive of the programme for shopping centres to be vaccination centres for their retailers.\n\n\u201cOur staff at Caring outlets nationwide are retail frontliners who deal with a huge number of customers, so they are exposed to a certain level of risk during this Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cVaccination for our staff is the best way to protect themselves and at the same time, boosts customer confidence when patronising our stores.\n\n\u201cIt is also geared towards achieving herd immunity the soonest possible.\n\n\u201cCaring encourages all our staff to be vaccinated once the request to set up a vaccination centre in malls is approved by the government, \u201d she told StarMetro.The pharmacy currently has 144 outlets nationwide with more than 1,100 staff, including pharmacists.\n\nNg opined that a small fee charged to tenants in order to get their workers vaccinated was reasonable.\n\n\u201cThe company is willing to chip in as part of its responsibility to get as many employees as we can vaccinated, \u201d she said.\n\n\n\nBangsar Village 2 management has offered to use a vacant lot on its third floor as a vaccination centre not only for mall staff but also for workers in the Telawi commercial area.\n\nDin Tai Fung Malaysia business development director Jeffrey Lim said all its restaurant employees, excluding pregnant women and those with allergies, were supportive of the programme and wanted to get vaccinated as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cOur 11 restaurants nationwide serve customers on a daily basis and we are very heartened to be considered as frontliners.\n\n\u201cWe believe that we can do our part in flattening the curve by getting vaccinated.\n\n\u201cThe company is also bearing the costs for our employees to ensure their safety, \u201d he said.\n\nTGV Cinemas sales and marketing general manager Mohit Bhargava said the company was fully supportive of the initiative.\n\n\u201cWe have enlisted our staff as part of the vaccination programme being rolled out at the shopping centres where we are tenants.\n\n\u201cIt is a collective effort to achieve herd immunity and definitely our frontline staff\u2019s safety is our priority,

allowed to operate during the current Movement Control Order (MCO), clarified Minister of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) Dato Sri Alexander Nanta Linggi.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, he said the list of essential services that have been authorised to operate had been clearly stated in his official statement issued on May 31.\n\n\u201cIn the list provided, it has been explained that convenience stores or mini markets and grocery stores are categorised as essential and given permission to operate \u2013 it simply means that all items in these convenience stores, therefore, can be sold to consumers, including alcohol and cigarettes.\n\n\u201cIn the supermarket premises and hypermarkets, the sale of goods is limited to food and beverages/basic necessities, pharmacy/personal care stores and convenience stores/mini marts and restaurants (only for takeaway).\n\n\u201cJust like in convenience stores, liquors are also sold among other essentials in supermarket beverages section and therefore, it can be sold to consumers. It must be stressed here that stores selling only liquor products are not allowed to operate,\u201d he added.\n\nNanta said the ministry took note of the National Security Council\u2019s (NSC) decision that allows the sale of liquor in convenience stores, given that the premises is licensed to sell them.\n\nThis was following claims by Bangi MP Dr Ong Kian Ming that the ministry had never issued any statements on this matter to clear the air as this issue had drawn the attention of the public.\n\nDr Ong also claimed that the ministry had \u2018maintained an elegant silence\u2019 on the issue of car workshops operation, which led to more confusion among business owners who were clueless on whether they were given permission to operate \u2013 causing many workshops to be closed and caused unnecessary inconveniences to many parties including consumers.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of car workshops, the media statement issued had also clarified that vehicle workshop services, maintenance and spare parts are listed as activities that are allowed to operate with the capacity of employees limited to 60 per cent only. However, car wash services are not allowed.\n\n\u201cTherefore, allegation that the ministry is keeping mum on these issues is baseless.
