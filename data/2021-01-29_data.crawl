previous enforcement of MCO in March 2020\n\nby AFIQ AZIZ / pic by TMR FILE\n\nPETROL dealers are in the dark over the issue of fuel ceiling price which has been steadily increasing since mid-November 2020.\n\nWithout a ceiling price, petrol station operators\u2019 cashflow will remain tight as they will have to buy fuel at higher prices, making the cost of holding stocks more expensive, said the Petrol Dealer Association of Malaysia (PDAM).\n\nIts president Datuk Khairul Annuar Abdul Aziz said currently, station owners have yet to recover their losses from the previous enforcement of the Movement Control Order (MCO) in March 2020.\n\nThe stay-at-home orders, he said, have swiped at least 70% of their business revenues.\n\n\u201cSales dropped by 70% when the MCO was called, but dealers managed to slowly recover in October last year, with sales picking up to about 80% compared to the pre-MCO period.\n\n\u201cSo, now that the fuel price is going up, we need to know if the ceiling price is in place or has been revoked.\n\n\u201cIf there is no ceiling price, dealers will hold expensive stock while demand is again affected in MCO 2.0,\u201d Khairul Annuar told The Malaysian Reserve (TMR).\n\nIn June last year, several media agencies reported that the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) had revoked the petrol price control order which restricted the maximum price of RON95 to RM2.08 per litre and diesel to RM2.18 per litre.\n\nThe revocation was announced in a federal gazette titled Price Control and Anti-Profiteering (Determination of Maximum Retail Price for Petrol and Diesel) (No 8) (Revocation) Order 2020 which was dated June 3, approved by KPDNHEP Minister Datuk Alexander Nanta Linggi on April 10.\n\nNanta Linggi clarified that the order on ceiling retail prices of petrol and diesel is still in place.\n\nHe stated that it was actually a change in mechanism to improve the monitoring and enforcement efficiency to counter any violation under the Control of Supplies Act 1961.\n\nHowever, since then, petrol dealers have been kept in the dark, Khairul Annuar said, who demanded KPDNHEP to clarify the matter.\n\n\u201cNow, we are not sure if there is any price capping for the fuel price as the government will need to subsidise it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe previous Pakatan Harapan government had set the ceiling price for RON95 at RM2.08 per litre and diesel at RM2.14 per litre.\n\nRON95 was traded at the high of RM2.08 per litre on March 6, but the price had dipped to the lowest in early May at RM1.25 due to the MCO.\n\nThe price has fluctuated since and steadily went up from RM1.61 on Nov 13 to the current price of RM1.90.\n\nNanta Linggi stated the ministry will only intercept the fuel price through a mechanism when it goes up to a certain level.\n\nA source in the government told TMR that the price ceiling mechanism is still in place and the new price ceiling is expected to be announced by the Finance Ministry.\n\nMeanwhile, Khairul Annuar said more than 10 PDAM members decided to close shop last year due to the tough economic climate caused by the MCO and Covid-19 outbreak.\n\n\u201cSome station operators surrendered their dealership to the oil company and dealers who owned businesses have closed down their stations,\u201d he said.\n\nKhairul Annuar said a ceiling price would allow petrol dealers to breathe, as the current MCO is causing losses like the previous lockdown, especially for those operating at highways.\n\nAlthough the January 2021 MCO allows some sectors to operate, interstate travelling is still restricted.\n\nIf the government introduces a lockdown like last year, Khairul Annuar said all petrol dealers will be bleeding in the next couple of months.\n\n\u201cIt must be noted that the petrol dealer business is essential.\n\n\u201cEven during spikes of Covid-19 cases, we need to open our doors.\n\n\u201cFor example, while the Johor and Singapore borders are closed, petrol stations at the Second Link must continue to operate; however, there is no business there,\u201d Khairil Annuar said.\n\nHe added that even though petrol stations are running at a loss, they cannot close.\n\n\u201cIt is important for the business to survive and continue supporting the economy,\u201d he said.\n\nPDAM represents some 3,800 petrol dealers nationwide.\n\nRead our earlier

Previously, DeepScience had received an angel investment from InnoAngel Fund.\n\nFounded in April 2016 in Beijing, DeepScience deeply focuses on full-stack real-time animation and virtual live streaming technologies, and has achieved virtual and real image synthesis and digital human-computer interaction functions in a number of commercial fields.\n\nIts products include \u201cDreamMaker Lite\u201d and \u201cDreamMaker Plus\u201d for professional animation content production, \u201cDreamMaker Easy\u201d for fast animation content production and virtual live streaming, as well as the recently-launched \u201cDreamMaker Easy Plug-in\u201d and \u201cVHost\u201d for \u20187*24 hours\u2019 AI virtual live streaming on e-commerce platform.\n\nDeepScience founder David Cheng said compared with traditional Internet applications, realtime animation and virtual live streaming products have a complicated technical process, which involves human-computer interaction, real-time rendering, various AI actions and image processing technologies, and hence, it is not as simple as following the route of system integration.\n\nToward this end, DeepScience has created a triple-barrier to ensure the long-term sustainable development of the enterprise. The first of these is invention patents, whereby DeepScience has applied for 50 invention patents. The second is the development of motion capture, facial expression capture, gesture capture and other underlying technologies. The third area of focus is on various application scenarios around the launch of diversified segmented products.\n\nTo date, DeepScience has already served many well-known IPs in China such as Yichan Little Monk, Momo Girl, Bud Bear and Jiangxiaoyu. Moving forward, DeepScience expects not only to serve more IPs, but to also help IPs better achieve commercial realisation via operation management.\n\nCheng said due to the more developed and diversified e-commerce ecology in China, the development of domestic virtual idol and virtual live streaming industry will increasingly incorporate Chinese characteristics, which is different from Japanese models such as Hatsune Miku and Tripping Love.\n\nFurther, compared with the models in Japan and other countries that emphasise art, the Chinese model is characterised by more emphasis on interaction, faster monetisation and more emphasis on technology. He said that with China already leading the world in the technology of virtual live streaming and a few other fields, it will continue to expand its advantage in the next few years. While in the past, virtual live streaming was mostly based in Japan, now and in the future, virtual live streaming will be led by China, Cheng added.\n\nProducts such as \u201cDreamMaker Easy Plug-in\u201d and \u201cVHost\u201d have been successively launched by DeepScience. The goal of this series of products is to help e-commerce retailers on platforms such as Tmall, Douyin/TikTok and Pinduoduo realise 7*24 hour AI automatic live streaming to sell goods, and continuously improve the effect of generating increasing orders.\n\nGiven that most e-commerce companies do not have their own virtual IP images, DeepScience provides hundreds of free images for customers to use conveniently. These products are particularly popular on Tmall and Douyin/TikTok, and have been used by a number of well-known e-commerce brands such as Schneider, Panasonic Bathroom, Estetin and Membrane Family.\n\nMYEG Capital is the venture investment arm of MYEG.

Pasai Cluster will not be the last, it is the first (of such a severe outbreak), but certainly will not be the last.\n\n\u201cWe need to have a proper research into this and understand the whole environment of the cluster, so that next time, if a longhouse is exposed, we would know how to deal with it effectively and we will not allow it to become so big,\u201d he said.\n\nSibu Municipal Council (SMC) chairman Clarence Ting, who hosted the discussion, had asked why the Pasai Cluster was so severe compared to other clusters .\n\nThe Pasai Cluster, which started in several longhouses in Sibu, was declared by the State Health Department on Jan 9 after 38 positive cases were detected from the cluster including its index case who was found positive on Jan 7.\n\nThe Sarawak Disaster Management Committee (SDMC) yesterday said the Pasai Cluster, has so far recorded a total of 2,363 cases throughout the state.\n\nAs of yesterday, Sibu has contributed 2,041 cases to the state tally of 5,760.\n\nDr Ooi also said that it was not difficult to imagine why Pasai Cluster cases had spread very fast due to the environment and lifestyle in the longhouse.\n\n\u201cEvery longhouse consists of one single house with many \u2018bilik\u2019 or \u2018pintu\u2019.

previous enforcement of MCO in March 2020\n\nby AFIQ AZIZ / pic by TMR FILE\n\nPETROL dealers are in the dark over the issue of fuel ceiling price which has been steadily increasing since mid-November 2020.\n\nWithout a ceiling price, petrol station operators\u2019 cashflow will remain tight as they will have to buy fuel at higher prices, making the cost of holding stocks more expensive, said the Petrol Dealer Association of Malaysia (PDAM).\n\nIts president Datuk Khairul Annuar Abdul Aziz said currently, station owners have yet to recover their losses from the previous enforcement of the Movement Control Order (MCO) in March 2020.\n\nThe stay-at-home orders, he said, have swiped at least 70% of their business revenues.\n\n\u201cSales dropped by 70% when the MCO was called, but dealers managed to slowly recover in October last year, with sales picking up to about 80% compared to the pre-MCO period.\n\n\u201cSo, now that the fuel price is going up, we need to know if the ceiling price is in place or has been revoked.\n\n\u201cIf there is no ceiling price, dealers will hold expensive stock while demand is again affected in MCO 2.0,\u201d Khairul Annuar told The Malaysian Reserve (TMR).\n\nIn June last year, several media agencies reported that the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) had revoked the petrol price control order which restricted the maximum price of RON95 to RM2.08 per litre and diesel to RM2.18 per litre.\n\nThe revocation was announced in a federal gazette titled Price Control and Anti-Profiteering (Determination of Maximum Retail Price for Petrol and Diesel) (No 8) (Revocation) Order 2020 which was dated June 3, approved by KPDNHEP Minister Datuk Alexander Nanta Linggi on April 10.\n\nNanta Linggi clarified that the order on ceiling retail prices of petrol and diesel is still in place.\n\nHe stated that it was actually a change in mechanism to improve the monitoring and enforcement efficiency to counter any violation under the Control of Supplies Act 1961.\n\nHowever, since then, petrol dealers have been kept in the dark, Khairul Annuar said, who demanded KPDNHEP to clarify the matter.\n\n\u201cNow, we are not sure if there is any price capping for the fuel price as the government will need to subsidise it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe previous Pakatan Harapan government had set the ceiling price for RON95 at RM2.08 per litre and diesel at RM2.14 per litre.\n\nRON95 was traded at the high of RM2.08 per litre on March 6, but the price had dipped to the lowest in early May at RM1.25 due to the MCO.\n\nThe price has fluctuated since and steadily went up from RM1.61 on Nov 13 to the current price of RM1.90.\n\nNanta Linggi stated the ministry will only intercept the fuel price through a mechanism when it goes up to a certain level.\n\nA source in the government told TMR that the price ceiling mechanism is still in place and the new price ceiling is expected to be announced by the Finance Ministry.\n\nMeanwhile, Khairul Annuar said more than 10 PDAM members decided to close shop last year due to the tough economic climate caused by the MCO and Covid-19 outbreak.\n\n\u201cSome station operators surrendered their dealership to the oil company and dealers who owned businesses have closed down their stations,\u201d he said.\n\nKhairul Annuar said a ceiling price would allow petrol dealers to breathe, as the current MCO is causing losses like the previous lockdown, especially for those operating at highways.\n\nAlthough the January 2021 MCO allows some sectors to operate, interstate travelling is still restricted.\n\nIf the government introduces a lockdown like last year, Khairul Annuar said all petrol dealers will be bleeding in the next couple of months.\n\n\u201cIt must be noted that the petrol dealer business is essential.\n\n\u201cEven during spikes of Covid-19 cases, we need to open our doors.\n\n\u201cFor example, while the Johor and Singapore borders are closed, petrol stations at the Second Link must continue to operate; however, there is no business there,\u201d Khairil Annuar said.\n\nHe added that even though petrol stations are running at a loss, they cannot close.\n\n\u201cIt is important for the business to survive and continue supporting the economy,\u201d he said.\n\nPDAM represents some 3,800 petrol dealers nationwide.\n\nRead our earlier

Previously, DeepScience had received an angel investment from InnoAngel Fund.\n\nFounded in April 2016 in Beijing, DeepScience deeply focuses on full-stack real-time animation and virtual live streaming technologies, and has achieved virtual and real image synthesis and digital human-computer interaction functions in a number of commercial fields.\n\nIts products include \u201cDreamMaker Lite\u201d and \u201cDreamMaker Plus\u201d for professional animation content production, \u201cDreamMaker Easy\u201d for fast animation content production and virtual live streaming, as well as the recently-launched \u201cDreamMaker Easy Plug-in\u201d and \u201cVHost\u201d for \u20187*24 hours\u2019 AI virtual live streaming on e-commerce platform.\n\nDeepScience founder David Cheng said compared with traditional Internet applications, realtime animation and virtual live streaming products have a complicated technical process, which involves human-computer interaction, real-time rendering, various AI actions and image processing technologies, and hence, it is not as simple as following the route of system integration.\n\nToward this end, DeepScience has created a triple-barrier to ensure the long-term sustainable development of the enterprise. The first of these is invention patents, whereby DeepScience has applied for 50 invention patents. The second is the development of motion capture, facial expression capture, gesture capture and other underlying technologies. The third area of focus is on various application scenarios around the launch of diversified segmented products.\n\nTo date, DeepScience has already served many well-known IPs in China such as Yichan Little Monk, Momo Girl, Bud Bear and Jiangxiaoyu. Moving forward, DeepScience expects not only to serve more IPs, but to also help IPs better achieve commercial realisation via operation management.\n\nCheng said due to the more developed and diversified e-commerce ecology in China, the development of domestic virtual idol and virtual live streaming industry will increasingly incorporate Chinese characteristics, which is different from Japanese models such as Hatsune Miku and Tripping Love.\n\nFurther, compared with the models in Japan and other countries that emphasise art, the Chinese model is characterised by more emphasis on interaction, faster monetisation and more emphasis on technology. He said that with China already leading the world in the technology of virtual live streaming and a few other fields, it will continue to expand its advantage in the next few years. While in the past, virtual live streaming was mostly based in Japan, now and in the future, virtual live streaming will be led by China, Cheng added.\n\nProducts such as \u201cDreamMaker Easy Plug-in\u201d and \u201cVHost\u201d have been successively launched by DeepScience. The goal of this series of products is to help e-commerce retailers on platforms such as Tmall, Douyin/TikTok and Pinduoduo realise 7*24 hour AI automatic live streaming to sell goods, and continuously improve the effect of generating increasing orders.\n\nGiven that most e-commerce companies do not have their own virtual IP images, DeepScience provides hundreds of free images for customers to use conveniently. These products are particularly popular on Tmall and Douyin/TikTok, and have been used by a number of well-known e-commerce brands such as Schneider, Panasonic Bathroom, Estetin and Membrane Family.\n\nMYEG Capital is the venture investment arm of MYEG.

Pasai Cluster will not be the last, it is the first (of such a severe outbreak), but certainly will not be the last.\n\n\u201cWe need to have a proper research into this and understand the whole environment of the cluster, so that next time, if a longhouse is exposed, we would know how to deal with it effectively and we will not allow it to become so big,\u201d he said.\n\nSibu Municipal Council (SMC) chairman Clarence Ting, who hosted the discussion, had asked why the Pasai Cluster was so severe compared to other clusters .\n\nThe Pasai Cluster, which started in several longhouses in Sibu, was declared by the State Health Department on Jan 9 after 38 positive cases were detected from the cluster including its index case who was found positive on Jan 7.\n\nThe Sarawak Disaster Management Committee (SDMC) yesterday said the Pasai Cluster, has so far recorded a total of 2,363 cases throughout the state.\n\nAs of yesterday, Sibu has contributed 2,041 cases to the state tally of 5,760.\n\nDr Ooi also said that it was not difficult to imagine why Pasai Cluster cases had spread very fast due to the environment and lifestyle in the longhouse.\n\n\u201cEvery longhouse consists of one single house with many \u2018bilik\u2019 or \u2018pintu\u2019. The way of life in the longhouse especially at night or weekend, folks usually sit together at ruai and interact with one another. Relatives also live in the same house.\n\n\u201cWe in Sarawak, we are friendly people, we like to interact. I think that communal spirit and lifestyle also contributed to this,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also said that the fourth wave of Covid-19 outbreak was challenging as it involved both rural areas and spread back to town areas.\n\nHe said most rural folk especially the longhouse folk work in town and would go back to their longhouses every weekend.\n\nDr Ooi, however, believed that Sarawak was still very much in the containment stage and the state could overcome the outbreak if everybody played their parts together.\n\nHe also said that Sibu could learn a lot from the third wave outbreak involving the Greenhill Cluster in Kuching in the effort to bring the cases down.\n\nAccording to him, when Greenhill Cluster was detected, a lot of cases involved friends and relatives. Subsequently, these close contacts then contacted their own friends and relatives.\n\n\u201cSo, a lot of people actually did not wait for the contact tracer to contact them, they were getting involved themselves. This is the key element for us to control and bring the cases down,\u201d Dr Ooi said, adding that Haji Baki Cluster was also another success story.\n\nHe pointed out that each cluster outbreak in Kuching starting from the first outbreak last year usually lasted for a few months before it could be controlled completely.", "keyword": ["suggests", "involved", "study", "sgh", "ooi", "cluster", "longhouse", "state", "sibu", "outbreak", "cases", "consultant", "effectively", "covid", "pasai", "tackle", "longhouses"], "summary": "Pasai Cluster will not be the last, it is the first (of such a severe outbreak), but certainly will not be the last.\nSibu Municipal Council (SMC) chairman Clarence Ting, who hosted the discussion, had asked why the Pasai Cluster was so severe compared to other clusters .\nThe Sarawak Disaster Management Committee (SDMC) yesterday said the Pasai Cluster, has so far recorded a total of 2,363 cases throughout the state.\nAccording to him, when Greenhill Cluster was detected, a lot of cases involved friends and relatives.\nHe pointed out that each cluster outbreak in Kuching starting from the first outbreak last year usually lasted for a few months before it could be controlled completely.", "news": "The Borneo Post", "date": "2021-02-09 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "No law against making an appeal to the King, says Anwar", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wMi8wMi9uby1sYXctYWdhaW5zdC1tYWtpbmctYW4tYXBwZWFsLXRvLXRoZS1raW5nLXNheXMtYW53YXIv0gEA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Ainaa Aiman"], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ANWAR-IBRAHIM-FMT-200220-9-1-1.jpg", "text": "PETALING JAYA: Opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim has asked police to make clear the law under which they are investigating him over his letter to the King appealing for the revocation of the proclamation of emergency.\n\nSaying that there is no law in the country that stops anyone from appealing to the King to rescind his decision, the PKR president questioned the need for him to give a statement to police on the matter.\n\n\u201cI want to ask, what laws do we have in our country (that says this is wrong)?

previous enforcement of MCO in March 2020\n\nby AFIQ AZIZ / pic by TMR FILE\n\nPETROL dealers are in the dark over the issue of fuel ceiling price which has been steadily increasing since mid-November 2020.\n\nWithout a ceiling price, petrol station operators\u2019 cashflow will remain tight as they will have to buy fuel at higher prices, making the cost of holding stocks more expensive, said the Petrol Dealer Association of Malaysia (PDAM).\n\nIts president Datuk Khairul Annuar Abdul Aziz said currently, station owners have yet to recover their losses from the previous enforcement of the Movement Control Order (MCO) in March 2020.\n\nThe stay-at-home orders, he said, have swiped at least 70% of their business revenues.\n\n\u201cSales dropped by 70% when the MCO was called, but dealers managed to slowly recover in October last year, with sales picking up to about 80% compared to the pre-MCO period.\n\n\u201cSo, now that the fuel price is going up, we need to know if the ceiling price is in place or has been revoked.\n\n\u201cIf there is no ceiling price, dealers will hold expensive stock while demand is again affected in MCO 2.0,\u201d Khairul Annuar told The Malaysian Reserve (TMR).\n\nIn June last year, several media agencies reported that the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) had revoked the petrol price control order which restricted the maximum price of RON95 to RM2.08 per litre and diesel to RM2.18 per litre.\n\nThe revocation was announced in a federal gazette titled Price Control and Anti-Profiteering (Determination of Maximum Retail Price for Petrol and Diesel) (No 8) (Revocation) Order 2020 which was dated June 3, approved by KPDNHEP Minister Datuk Alexander Nanta Linggi on April 10.\n\nNanta Linggi clarified that the order on ceiling retail prices of petrol and diesel is still in place.\n\nHe stated that it was actually a change in mechanism to improve the monitoring and enforcement efficiency to counter any violation under the Control of Supplies Act 1961.\n\nHowever, since then, petrol dealers have been kept in the dark, Khairul Annuar said, who demanded KPDNHEP to clarify the matter.\n\n\u201cNow, we are not sure if there is any price capping for the fuel price as the government will need to subsidise it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe previous Pakatan Harapan government had set the ceiling price for RON95 at RM2.08 per litre and diesel at RM2.14 per litre.\n\nRON95 was traded at the high of RM2.08 per litre on March 6, but the price had dipped to the lowest in early May at RM1.25 due to the MCO.\n\nThe price has fluctuated since and steadily went up from RM1.61 on Nov 13 to the current price of RM1.90.\n\nNanta Linggi stated the ministry will only intercept the fuel price through a mechanism when it

Previously, DeepScience had received an angel investment from InnoAngel Fund.\n\nFounded in April 2016 in Beijing, DeepScience deeply focuses on full-stack real-time animation and virtual live streaming technologies, and has achieved virtual and real image synthesis and digital human-computer interaction functions in a number of commercial fields.\n\nIts products include \u201cDreamMaker Lite\u201d and \u201cDreamMaker Plus\u201d for professional animation content production, \u201cDreamMaker Easy\u201d for fast animation content production and virtual live streaming, as well as the recently-launched \u201cDreamMaker Easy Plug-in\u201d and \u201cVHost\u201d for \u20187*24 hours\u2019 AI virtual live streaming on e-commerce platform.\n\nDeepScience founder David Cheng said compared with traditional Internet applications, realtime animation and virtual live streaming products have a complicated technical process, which involves human-computer interaction, real-time rendering, various AI actions and image processing technologies, and hence, it is not as simple as following the route of system integration.\n\nToward this end, DeepScience has created a triple-barrier to ensure the long-term sustainable development of the enterprise. The first of these is invention patents, whereby DeepScience has applied for 50 invention patents. The second is the development of motion capture, facial expression capture, gesture capture and other underlying technologies. The third area of focus is on various application scenarios around the launch of diversified segmented products.\n\nTo date, DeepScience has already served many well-known IPs in China such as Yichan Little Monk, Momo Girl, Bud Bear and Jiangxiaoyu. Moving forward, DeepScience expects not only to serve more IPs, but to also help IPs better achieve commercial realisation via operation management.\n\nCheng said due to the more developed and diversified e-commerce ecology in China, the development of domestic virtual idol and virtual live streaming industry will increasingly incorporate Chinese characteristics, which is different from Japanese models such as Hatsune Miku and Tripping Love.\n\nFurther, compared with the models in Japan and other countries that emphasise art, the Chinese model is characterised by more emphasis on interaction, faster monetisation and more emphasis on technology. He said that with China already leading the world in the technology of virtual live streaming and a few other fields, it will continue to expand its advantage in the next few years. While in the past, virtual live streaming was mostly based in Japan, now and in the future, virtual live streaming will be led by China, Cheng added.\n\nProducts such as \u201cDreamMaker Easy Plug-in\u201d and \u201cVHost\u201d have been successively launched by DeepScience. The goal of this series of products is to help e-commerce retailers on platforms such as Tmall, Douyin/TikTok and Pinduoduo realise 7*24 hour AI automatic live streaming to sell goods, and continuously improve the effect of generating increasing orders.\n\nGiven that most e-commerce companies do not have their own virtual IP images, DeepScience provides hundreds of free images for customers to use conveniently. These products are particularly popular on Tmall and Douyin/TikTok, and have been used by a number of well-known e-commerce brands such as Schneider, Panasonic Bathroom, Estetin and Membrane Family.\n\nMYEG Capital is the venture investment arm of MYEG.

Pasai Cluster will not be the last, it is the first (of such a severe outbreak), but certainly will not be the last.\n\n\u201cWe need to have a proper research into this and understand the whole environment of the cluster, so that next time, if a longhouse is exposed, we would know how to deal with it effectively and we will not allow it to become so big,\u201d he said.\n\nSibu Municipal Council (SMC) chairman Clarence Ting, who hosted the discussion, had asked why the Pasai Cluster was so severe compared to other clusters .\n\nThe Pasai Cluster, which started in several longhouses in Sibu, was declared by the State Health Department on Jan 9 after 38 positive cases were detected from the cluster including its index case who was found positive on Jan 7.\n\nThe Sarawak Disaster Management Committee (SDMC) yesterday said the Pasai Cluster, has so far recorded a total of 2,363 cases throughout the state.\n\nAs of yesterday, Sibu has contributed 2,041 cases to the state tally of 5,760.\n\nDr Ooi also said that it was not difficult to imagine why Pasai Cluster cases had spread very fast due to the environment and lifestyle in the longhouse.\n\n\u201cEvery longhouse consists of one single house with many \u2018bilik\u2019 or \u2018pintu\u2019.

Subsequently, these close contacts then contacted their own friends and relatives.\n\n\u201cSo, a lot of people actually did not wait for the contact tracer to contact them, they were getting involved themselves. This is the key element for us to control and bring the cases down,\u201d Dr Ooi said, adding that Haji Baki Cluster was also another success story.\n\nHe pointed out that each cluster outbreak in Kuching starting from the first outbreak last year usually lasted for a few months before it could be controlled completely.", "keyword": ["suggests", "involved", "study", "sgh", "ooi", "cluster", "longhouse", "state", "sibu", "outbreak", "cases", "consultant", "effectively", "covid", "pasai", "tackle", "longhouses"], "summary": "Pasai Cluster will not be the last, it is the first (of such a severe outbreak), but certainly will not be the last.\nSibu Municipal Council (SMC) chairman Clarence Ting, who hosted the discussion, had asked why the Pasai Cluster was so severe compared to other clusters .\nThe Sarawak Disaster Management Committee (SDMC) yesterday said the Pasai Cluster, has so far recorded a total of 2,363 cases throughout the state.\nAccording to him, when Greenhill Cluster was detected, a lot of cases involved friends and relatives.\nHe pointed out that each cluster outbreak in Kuching starting from the first outbreak last year usually lasted for a few months before it could be controlled completely.", "news": "The Borneo Post", "date": "2021-02-09 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "No law against making an appeal to the King, says Anwar", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wMi8wMi9uby1sYXctYWdhaW5zdC1tYWtpbmctYW4tYXBwZWFsLXRvLXRoZS1raW5nLXNheXMtYW53YXIv0gEA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Ainaa Aiman"], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ANWAR-IBRAHIM-FMT-200220-9-1-1.jpg", "text": "PETALING JAYA: Opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim has asked police to make clear the law under which they are investigating him over his letter to the King appealing for the revocation of the proclamation of emergency.\n\nSaying that there is no law in the country that stops anyone from appealing to the King to rescind his decision, the PKR president questioned the need for him to give a statement to police on the matter.\n\n\u201cI want to ask, what laws do we have in our country (that says this is wrong)?

previous enforcement of MCO in March 2020\n\nby AFIQ AZIZ / pic by TMR FILE\n\nPETROL dealers are in the dark over the issue of fuel ceiling price which has been steadily increasing since mid-November 2020.\n\nWithout a ceiling price, petrol station operators\u2019 cashflow will remain tight as they will have to buy fuel at higher prices, making the cost of holding stocks more expensive, said the Petrol Dealer Association of Malaysia (PDAM).\n\nIts president Datuk Khairul Annuar Abdul Aziz said currently, station owners have yet to recover their losses from the previous enforcement of the Movement Control Order (MCO) in March 2020.\n\nThe stay-at-home orders, he said, have swiped at least 70% of their business revenues.\n\n\u201cSales dropped by 70% when the MCO was called, but dealers managed to slowly recover in October last year, with sales picking up to about 80% compared to the pre-MCO period.\n\n\u201cSo, now that the fuel price is going up, we need to know if the ceiling price is in place or has been revoked.\n\n\u201cIf there is no ceiling price, dealers will hold expensive stock while demand is again affected in MCO 2.0,\u201d Khairul Annuar told The Malaysian Reserve (TMR).\n\nIn June last year, several media agencies reported that the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) had revoked the petrol price control order which restricted the maximum price of RON95 to RM2.08 per litre and diesel to RM2.18 per litre.\n\nThe revocation was announced in a federal gazette titled Price Control and Anti-Profiteering (Determination of Maximum Retail Price for Petrol and Diesel) (No 8) (Revocation) Order 2020 which was dated June 3, approved by KPDNHEP Minister Datuk Alexander Nanta Linggi on April 10.\n\nNanta Linggi clarified that the order on ceiling retail prices of petrol and diesel is still in place.\n\nHe stated that it was actually a change in mechanism to improve the monitoring and enforcement efficiency to counter any violation under the Control of Supplies Act 1961.\n\nHowever, since then, petrol dealers have been kept in the dark, Khairul Annuar said, who demanded KPDNHEP to clarify the matter.\n\n\u201cNow, we are not sure if there is any price capping for the fuel price as the government will need to subsidise it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe previous Pakatan Harapan government had set the ceiling price for RON95 at RM2.08 per litre and diesel at RM2.14 per litre.\n\nRON95 was traded at the high of RM2.08 per litre on March 6, but the price had dipped to the lowest in early May at RM1.25 due to the MCO.\n\nThe price has fluctuated since and steadily went up from RM1.61 on Nov 13 to the current price of RM1.90.\n\nNanta Linggi stated the ministry will only intercept the fuel price through a mechanism when it goes up to a certain level.\n\nA source in the government told TMR that the price ceiling mechanism is still in place and the new price ceiling is expected to be announced by the Finance Ministry.\n\nMeanwhile, Khairul Annuar said more than 10 PDAM members decided to close shop last year due to the tough economic climate caused by the MCO and Covid-19 outbreak.\n\n\u201cSome station operators surrendered their dealership to the oil company and dealers who owned businesses have closed down their stations,\u201d he said.\n\nKhairul Annuar said a ceiling price would allow petrol dealers to breathe, as the current MCO is causing losses like the previous lockdown, especially for those operating at highways.\n\nAlthough the January 2021 MCO allows some sectors to operate, interstate travelling is still restricted.\n\nIf the government introduces a lockdown like last year, Khairul Annuar said all petrol dealers will be bleeding in the next couple of months.\n\n\u201cIt must be noted that the petrol dealer business is essential.\n\n\u201cEven during spikes of Covid-19 cases, we need to open our doors.\n\n\u201cFor example, while the Johor and Singapore borders are closed, petrol stations at the Second Link must continue to operate; however, there is no business there,\u201d Khairil Annuar said.\n\nHe added that even though petrol stations are running at a loss, they cannot close.\n\n\u201cIt is important for the business to survive and continue supporting the economy,\u201d he said.\n\nPDAM represents some 3,800 petrol dealers nationwide.\n\nRead our earlier

The third area of focus is on various application scenarios around the launch of diversified segmented products.\n\nTo date, DeepScience has already served many well-known IPs in China such as Yichan Little Monk, Momo Girl, Bud Bear and Jiangxiaoyu. Moving forward, DeepScience expects not only to serve more IPs, but to also help IPs better achieve commercial realisation via operation management.\n\nCheng said due to the more developed and diversified e-commerce ecology in China, the development of domestic virtual idol and virtual live streaming industry will increasingly incorporate Chinese characteristics, which is different from Japanese models such as Hatsune Miku and Tripping Love.\n\nFurther, compared with the models in Japan and other countries that emphasise art, the Chinese model is characterised by more emphasis on interaction, faster monetisation and more emphasis on technology. He said that with China already leading the world in the technology of virtual live streaming and a few other fields, it will continue to expand its advantage in the next few years. While in the past, virtual live streaming was mostly based in Japan, now and in the future, virtual live streaming will be led by China, Cheng added.\n\nProducts such as \u201cDreamMaker Easy Plug-in\u201d and \u201cVHost\u201d have been successively launched by DeepScience. The goal of this series of products is to help e-commerce retailers on platforms such as Tmall, Douyin/TikTok and Pinduoduo realise 7*24 hour AI automatic live streaming to sell goods, and continuously improve the effect of generating increasing orders.\n\nGiven that most e-commerce companies do not have their own virtual IP images, DeepScience provides hundreds of free images for customers to use conveniently. These products are particularly popular on Tmall and Douyin/TikTok, and have been used by a number of well-known e-commerce brands such as Schneider, Panasonic Bathroom, Estetin and Membrane Family.\n\nMYEG Capital is the venture investment arm of MYEG.

Pasai Cluster will not be the last, it is the first (of such a severe outbreak), but certainly will not be the last.\n\n\u201cWe need to have a proper research into this and understand the whole environment of the cluster, so that next time, if a longhouse is exposed, we would know how to deal with it effectively and we will not allow it to become so big,\u201d he said.\n\nSibu Municipal Council (SMC) chairman Clarence Ting, who hosted the discussion, had asked why the Pasai Cluster was so severe compared to other clusters .\n\nThe Pasai Cluster, which started in several longhouses in Sibu, was declared by the State Health Department on Jan 9 after 38 positive cases were detected from the cluster including its index case who was found positive on Jan 7.\n\nThe Sarawak Disaster Management Committee (SDMC) yesterday said the Pasai Cluster, has so far recorded a total of 2,363 cases throughout the state.\n\nAs of yesterday, Sibu has contributed 2,041 cases to the state tally of 5,760.\n\nDr Ooi also said that it was not difficult to imagine why Pasai Cluster cases had spread very fast due to the environment and lifestyle in the longhouse.\n\n\u201cEvery longhouse consists of one single house with many \u2018bilik\u2019 or \u2018pintu\u2019.

Subsequently, these close contacts then contacted their own friends and relatives.\n\n\u201cSo, a lot of people actually did not wait for the contact tracer to contact them, they were getting involved themselves. This is the key element for us to control and bring the cases down,\u201d Dr Ooi said, adding that Haji Baki Cluster was also another success story.\n\nHe pointed out that each cluster outbreak in Kuching starting from the first outbreak last year usually lasted for a few months before it could be controlled completely.", "keyword": ["suggests", "involved", "study", "sgh", "ooi", "cluster", "longhouse", "state", "sibu", "outbreak", "cases", "consultant", "effectively", "covid", "pasai", "tackle", "longhouses"], "summary": "Pasai Cluster will not be the last, it is the first (of such a severe outbreak), but certainly will not be the last.\nSibu Municipal Council (SMC) chairman Clarence Ting, who hosted the discussion, had asked why the Pasai Cluster was so severe compared to other clusters .\nThe Sarawak Disaster Management Committee (SDMC) yesterday said the Pasai Cluster, has so far recorded a total of 2,363 cases throughout the state.\nAccording to him, when Greenhill Cluster was detected, a lot of cases involved friends and relatives.\nHe pointed out that each cluster outbreak in Kuching starting from the first outbreak last year usually lasted for a few months before it could be controlled completely.", "news": "The Borneo Post", "date": "2021-02-09 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "No law against making an appeal to the King, says Anwar", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wMi8wMi9uby1sYXctYWdhaW5zdC1tYWtpbmctYW4tYXBwZWFsLXRvLXRoZS1raW5nLXNheXMtYW53YXIv0gEA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Ainaa Aiman"], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ANWAR-IBRAHIM-FMT-200220-9-1-1.jpg", "text": "PETALING JAYA: Opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim has asked police to make clear the law under which they are investigating him over his letter to the King appealing for the revocation of the proclamation of emergency.\n\nSaying that there is no law in the country that stops anyone from appealing to the King to rescind his decision, the PKR president questioned the need for him to give a statement to police on the matter.\n\n\u201cI want to ask, what laws do we have in our country (that says this is wrong)?

previous enforcement of MCO in March 2020\n\nby AFIQ AZIZ / pic by TMR FILE\n\nPETROL dealers are in the dark over the issue of fuel ceiling price which has been steadily increasing since mid-November 2020.\n\nWithout a ceiling price, petrol station operators\u2019 cashflow will remain tight as they will have to buy fuel at higher prices, making the cost of holding stocks more expensive, said the Petrol Dealer Association of Malaysia (PDAM).\n\nIts president Datuk Khairul Annuar Abdul Aziz said currently, station owners have yet to recover their losses from the previous enforcement of the Movement Control Order (MCO) in March 2020.\n\nThe stay-at-home orders, he said, have swiped at least 70% of their business revenues.\n\n\u201cSales dropped by 70% when the MCO was called, but dealers managed to slowly recover in October last year, with sales picking up to about 80% compared to the pre-MCO period.\n\n\u201cSo, now that the fuel price is going up, we need to know if the ceiling price is in place or has been revoked.\n\n\u201cIf there is no ceiling price, dealers will hold expensive stock while demand is again affected in MCO 2.0,\u201d Khairul Annuar told The Malaysian Reserve (TMR).\n\nIn June last year, several media agencies reported that the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) had revoked the petrol price control order which restricted the maximum price of RON95 to RM2.08 per litre and diesel to RM2.18 per litre.\n\nThe revocation was announced in a federal gazette titled Price Control and Anti-Profiteering (Determination of Maximum Retail Price for Petrol and Diesel) (No 8) (Revocation) Order 2020 which was dated June 3, approved by KPDNHEP Minister Datuk Alexander Nanta Linggi on April 10.\n\nNanta Linggi clarified that the order on ceiling retail prices of petrol and diesel is still in place.\n\nHe stated that it was actually a change in mechanism to improve the monitoring and enforcement efficiency to counter any violation under the Control of Supplies Act 1961.\n\nHowever, since then, petrol dealers have been kept in the dark, Khairul Annuar said, who demanded KPDNHEP to clarify the matter.\n\n\u201cNow, we are not sure if there is any price capping for the fuel price as the government will need to subsidise it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe previous Pakatan Harapan government had set the ceiling price for RON95 at RM2.08 per litre and diesel at RM2.14 per litre.\n\nRON95 was traded at the high of RM2.08 per litre on March 6, but the price had dipped to the lowest in early May at RM1.25 due to the MCO.\n\nThe price has fluctuated since and steadily went up from RM1.61 on Nov 13 to the current price of RM1.90.\n\nNanta Linggi stated the ministry will only intercept the fuel price through a mechanism when it goes up to a certain level.\n\nA source in the government told TMR that the price ceiling mechanism is still in place and the new price ceiling is expected to be announced by the Finance Ministry.\n\nMeanwhile, Khairul Annuar said more than 10 PDAM members decided to close shop last year due to the tough economic climate caused by the MCO and Covid-19 outbreak.\n\n\u201cSome station operators surrendered their dealership to the oil company and dealers who owned businesses have closed down their stations,\u201d he said.\n\nKhairul Annuar said a ceiling price would allow petrol dealers to breathe, as the current MCO is causing losses like the previous lockdown, especially for those operating at highways.\n\nAlthough the January 2021 MCO allows some sectors to operate, interstate travelling is still restricted.\n\nIf the government introduces a lockdown like last year, Khairul Annuar said all petrol dealers will be bleeding in the next couple of months.\n\n\u201cIt must be noted that the petrol dealer business is essential.\n\n\u201cEven during spikes of Covid-19 cases, we need to open our doors.\n\n\u201cFor example, while the Johor and Singapore borders are closed, petrol stations at the Second Link must continue to operate; however, there is no business there,\u201d Khairil Annuar said.\n\nHe added that even though petrol stations are running at a loss, they cannot close.\n\n\u201cIt is important for the business to survive and continue supporting the economy,\u201d he said.\n\nPDAM represents some 3,800 petrol dealers nationwide.\n\nRead our earlier

Previously, DeepScience had received an angel investment from InnoAngel Fund.\n\nFounded in April 2016 in Beijing, DeepScience deeply focuses on full-stack real-time animation and virtual live streaming technologies, and has achieved virtual and real image synthesis and digital human-computer interaction functions in a number of commercial fields.\n\nIts products include \u201cDreamMaker Lite\u201d and \u201cDreamMaker Plus\u201d for professional animation content production, \u201cDreamMaker Easy\u201d for fast animation content production and virtual live streaming, as well as the recently-launched \u201cDreamMaker Easy Plug-in\u201d and \u201cVHost\u201d for \u20187*24 hours\u2019 AI virtual live streaming on e-commerce platform.\n\nDeepScience founder David Cheng said compared with traditional Internet applications, realtime animation and virtual live streaming products have a complicated technical process, which involves human-computer interaction, real-time rendering, various AI actions and image processing technologies, and hence, it is not as simple as following the route of system integration.\n\nToward this end, DeepScience has created a triple-barrier to ensure the long-term sustainable development of the enterprise. The first of these is invention patents, whereby DeepScience has applied for 50 invention patents. The second is the development of motion capture, facial expression capture, gesture capture and other underlying technologies. The third area of focus is on various application scenarios around the launch of diversified segmented products.\n\nTo date, DeepScience has already served many well-known IPs in China such as Yichan Little Monk, Momo Girl, Bud Bear and Jiangxiaoyu. Moving forward, DeepScience expects not only to serve more IPs, but to also help IPs better achieve commercial realisation via operation management.\n\nCheng said due to the more developed and diversified e-commerce ecology in China, the development of domestic virtual idol and virtual live streaming industry will increasingly incorporate Chinese characteristics, which is different from Japanese models such as Hatsune Miku and Tripping Love.\n\nFurther, compared with the models in Japan and other countries that emphasise art, the Chinese model is characterised by more emphasis on interaction, faster monetisation and more emphasis on technology. He said that with China already leading the world in the technology of virtual live streaming and a few other fields, it will continue to expand its advantage in the next few years. While in the past, virtual live streaming was mostly based in Japan, now and in the future, virtual live streaming will be led by China, Cheng added.\n\nProducts such as \u201cDreamMaker Easy Plug-in\u201d and \u201cVHost\u201d have been successively launched by DeepScience. The goal of this series of products is to help e-commerce retailers on platforms such as Tmall, Douyin/TikTok and Pinduoduo realise 7*24 hour AI automatic live streaming to sell goods, and continuously improve the effect of generating increasing orders.\n\nGiven that most e-commerce companies do not have their own virtual IP images, DeepScience provides hundreds of free images for customers to use conveniently. These products are particularly popular on Tmall and Douyin/TikTok, and have been used by a number of well-known e-commerce brands such as Schneider, Panasonic Bathroom, Estetin and Membrane Family.\n\nMYEG Capital is the venture investment arm of MYEG.

previous enforcement of MCO in March 2020\n\nby AFIQ AZIZ / pic by TMR FILE\n\nPETROL dealers are in the dark over the issue of fuel ceiling price which has been steadily increasing since mid-November 2020.\n\nWithout a ceiling price, petrol station operators\u2019 cashflow will remain tight as they will have to buy fuel at higher prices, making the cost of holding stocks more expensive, said the Petrol Dealer Association of Malaysia (PDAM).\n\nIts president Datuk Khairul Annuar Abdul Aziz said currently, station owners have yet to recover their losses from the previous enforcement of the Movement Control Order (MCO) in March 2020.\n\nThe stay-at-home orders, he said, have swiped at least 70% of their business revenues.\n\n\u201cSales dropped by 70% when the MCO was called, but dealers managed to slowly recover in October last year, with sales picking up to about 80% compared to the pre-MCO period.\n\n\u201cSo, now that the fuel price is going up, we need to know if the ceiling price is in place or has been revoked.\n\n\u201cIf there is no ceiling price, dealers will hold expensive stock while demand is again affected in MCO 2.0,\u201d Khairul Annuar told The Malaysian Reserve (TMR).\n\nIn June last year, several media agencies reported that the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) had revoked the petrol price control order which restricted the maximum price of RON95 to RM2.08 per litre and diesel to RM2.18 per litre.\n\nThe revocation was announced in a federal gazette titled Price Control and Anti-Profiteering (Determination of Maximum Retail Price for Petrol and Diesel) (No 8) (Revocation) Order 2020 which was dated June 3, approved by KPDNHEP Minister Datuk Alexander Nanta Linggi on April 10.\n\nNanta Linggi clarified that the order on ceiling retail prices of petrol and diesel is still in place.\n\nHe stated that it was actually a change in mechanism to improve the monitoring and enforcement efficiency to counter any violation under the Control of Supplies Act 1961.\n\nHowever, since then, petrol dealers have been kept in the dark, Khairul Annuar said, who demanded KPDNHEP to clarify the matter.\n\n\u201cNow, we are not sure if there is any price capping for the fuel price as the government will need to subsidise it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe previous Pakatan Harapan government had set the ceiling price for RON95 at RM2.08 per litre and diesel at RM2.14 per litre.\n\nRON95 was traded at the high of RM2.08 per litre on March 6, but the price had dipped to the lowest in early May at RM1.25 due to the MCO.\n\nThe price has fluctuated since and steadily went up from RM1.61 on Nov 13 to the current price of RM1.90.\n\nNanta Linggi stated the ministry will only intercept the fuel price through a mechanism when it goes up to a certain level.\n\nA source in the government told TMR that the price ceiling mechanism is still in place and the new price ceiling is expected to be announced by the Finance Ministry.\n\nMeanwhile, Khairul Annuar said more than 10 PDAM members decided to close shop last year due to the tough economic climate caused by the MCO and Covid-19 outbreak.\n\n\u201cSome station operators surrendered their dealership to the oil company and dealers who owned businesses have closed down their stations,\u201d he said.\n\nKhairul Annuar said a ceiling price would allow petrol dealers to breathe, as the current MCO is causing losses like the previous lockdown, especially for those operating at highways.\n\nAlthough the January 2021 MCO allows some sectors to operate, interstate travelling is still restricted.\n\nIf the government introduces a lockdown like last year, Khairul Annuar said all petrol dealers will be bleeding in the next couple of months.\n\n\u201cIt must be noted that the petrol dealer business is essential.\n\n\u201cEven during spikes of Covid-19 cases, we need to open our doors.\n\n\u201cFor example, while the Johor and Singapore borders are closed, petrol stations at the Second Link must continue to operate; however, there is no business there,\u201d Khairil Annuar said.\n\nHe added that even though petrol stations are running at a loss, they cannot close.\n\n\u201cIt is important for the business to survive and continue supporting the economy,\u201d he said.\n\nPDAM represents some 3,800 petrol dealers nationwide.\n\nRead our earlier

Previously, DeepScience had received an angel investment from InnoAngel Fund.\n\nFounded in April 2016 in Beijing, DeepScience deeply focuses on full-stack real-time animation and virtual live streaming technologies, and has achieved virtual and real image synthesis and digital human-computer interaction functions in a number of commercial fields.\n\nIts products include \u201cDreamMaker Lite\u201d and \u201cDreamMaker Plus\u201d for professional animation content production, \u201cDreamMaker Easy\u201d for fast animation content production and virtual live streaming, as well as the recently-launched \u201cDreamMaker Easy Plug-in\u201d and \u201cVHost\u201d for \u20187*24 hours\u2019 AI virtual live streaming on e-commerce platform.\n\nDeepScience founder David Cheng said compared with traditional Internet applications, realtime animation and virtual live streaming products have a complicated technical process, which involves human-computer interaction, real-time rendering, various AI actions and image processing technologies, and hence, it is not as simple as following the route of system integration.\n\nToward this end, DeepScience has created a triple-barrier to ensure the long-term sustainable development of the enterprise. The first of these is invention patents, whereby DeepScience has applied for 50 invention patents. The second is the development of motion capture, facial expression capture, gesture capture and other underlying technologies. The third area of focus is on various application scenarios around the launch of diversified segmented products.\n\nTo date, DeepScience has already served many well-known IPs in China such as Yichan Little Monk, Momo Girl, Bud Bear and Jiangxiaoyu. Moving forward, DeepScience expects not only to serve more IPs, but to also help IPs better achieve commercial realisation via operation management.\n\nCheng said due to the more developed and diversified e-commerce ecology in China, the development of domestic virtual idol and virtual live streaming industry will increasingly incorporate Chinese characteristics, which is different from Japanese models such as Hatsune Miku and Tripping Love.\n\nFurther, compared with the models in Japan and other countries that emphasise art, the Chinese model is characterised by more emphasis on interaction, faster monetisation and more emphasis on technology. He said that with China already leading the world in the technology of virtual live streaming and a few other fields, it will continue to expand its advantage in the next few years. While in the past, virtual live streaming was mostly based in Japan, now and in the future, virtual live streaming will be led by China, Cheng added.\n\nProducts such as \u201cDreamMaker Easy Plug-in\u201d and \u201cVHost\u201d have been successively launched by DeepScience. The goal of this series of products is to help e-commerce retailers on platforms such as Tmall, Douyin/TikTok and Pinduoduo realise 7*24 hour AI automatic live streaming to sell goods, and continuously improve the effect of generating increasing orders.\n\nGiven that most e-commerce companies do not have their own virtual IP images, DeepScience provides hundreds of free images for customers to use conveniently. These products are particularly popular on Tmall and Douyin/TikTok, and have been used by a number of well-known e-commerce brands such as Schneider, Panasonic Bathroom, Estetin and Membrane Family.\n\nMYEG Capital is the venture investment arm of MYEG.

Pasai Cluster will not be the last, it is the first (of such a severe outbreak), but certainly will not be the last.\n\n\u201cWe need to have a proper research into this and understand the whole environment of the cluster, so that next time, if a longhouse is exposed, we would know how to deal with it effectively and we will not allow it to become so big,\u201d he said.\n\nSibu Municipal Council (SMC) chairman Clarence Ting, who hosted the discussion, had asked why the Pasai Cluster was so severe compared to other clusters .\n\nThe Pasai Cluster, which started in several longhouses in Sibu, was declared by the State Health Department on Jan 9 after 38 positive cases were detected from the cluster including its index case who was found positive on Jan 7.\n\nThe Sarawak Disaster Management Committee (SDMC) yesterday said the Pasai Cluster, has so far recorded a total of 2,363 cases throughout the state.\n\nAs of yesterday, Sibu has contributed 2,041 cases to the state tally of 5,760.\n\nDr Ooi also said that it was not difficult to imagine why Pasai Cluster cases had spread very fast due to the environment and lifestyle in the longhouse.\n\n\u201cEvery longhouse consists of one single house with many \u2018bilik\u2019 or \u2018pintu\u2019. The way of life in the longhouse especially at night or weekend, folks usually sit together at ruai and interact with one another. Relatives also live in the same house.\n\n\u201cWe in Sarawak, we are friendly people, we like to interact.

previous enforcement of MCO in March 2020\n\nby AFIQ AZIZ / pic by TMR FILE\n\nPETROL dealers are in the dark over the issue of fuel ceiling price which has been steadily increasing since mid-November 2020.\n\nWithout a ceiling price, petrol station operators\u2019 cashflow will remain tight as they will have to buy fuel at higher prices, making the cost of holding stocks more expensive, said the Petrol Dealer Association of Malaysia (PDAM).\n\nIts president Datuk Khairul Annuar Abdul Aziz said currently, station owners have yet to recover their losses from the previous enforcement of the Movement Control Order (MCO) in March 2020.\n\nThe stay-at-home orders, he said, have swiped at least 70% of their business revenues.\n\n\u201cSales dropped by 70% when the MCO was called, but dealers managed to slowly recover in October last year, with sales picking up to about 80% compared to the pre-MCO period.\n\n\u201cSo, now that the fuel price is going up, we need to know if the ceiling price is in place or has been revoked.\n\n\u201cIf there is no ceiling price, dealers will hold expensive stock while demand is again affected in MCO 2.0,\u201d Khairul Annuar told The Malaysian Reserve (TMR).\n\nIn June last year, several media agencies reported that the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) had revoked the petrol price control order which restricted the maximum price of RON95 to RM2.08 per litre and diesel to RM2.18 per litre.\n\nThe revocation was announced in a federal gazette titled Price Control and Anti-Profiteering (Determination of Maximum Retail Price for Petrol and Diesel) (No 8) (Revocation) Order 2020 which was dated June 3, approved by KPDNHEP Minister Datuk Alexander Nanta Linggi on April 10.\n\nNanta Linggi clarified that the order on ceiling retail prices of petrol and diesel is still in place.\n\nHe stated that it was actually a change in mechanism to improve the monitoring and enforcement efficiency to counter any violation under the Control of Supplies Act 1961.\n\nHowever, since then, petrol dealers have been kept in the dark, Khairul Annuar said, who demanded KPDNHEP to clarify the matter.\n\n\u201cNow, we are not sure if there is any price capping for the fuel price as the government will need to subsidise it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe previous Pakatan Harapan government had set the ceiling price for RON95 at RM2.08 per litre and diesel at RM2.14 per litre.\n\nRON95 was traded at the high of RM2.08 per litre on March 6, but the price had dipped to the lowest in early May at RM1.25 due to the MCO.\n\nThe price has fluctuated since and steadily went up from RM1.61 on Nov 13 to the current price of RM1.90.\n\nNanta Linggi stated the ministry will only intercept the fuel price through a mechanism when it goes up to a certain level.\n\nA source in the government told TMR that the price ceiling mechanism is still in place and the new price ceiling is expected to be announced by the Finance Ministry.\n\nMeanwhile, Khairul Annuar said more than 10 PDAM members decided to close shop last year due to the tough economic climate caused by the MCO and Covid-19 outbreak.\n\n\u201cSome station operators surrendered their dealership to the oil company and dealers who owned businesses have closed down their stations,\u201d he said.\n\nKhairul Annuar said a ceiling price would allow petrol dealers to breathe, as the current MCO is causing losses like the previous lockdown, especially for those operating at highways.\n\nAlthough the January 2021 MCO allows some sectors to operate, interstate travelling is still restricted.\n\nIf the government introduces a lockdown like last year, Khairul Annuar said all petrol dealers will be bleeding in the next couple of months.\n\n\u201cIt must be noted that the petrol dealer business is essential.\n\n\u201cEven during spikes of Covid-19 cases, we need to open our doors.\n\n\u201cFor example, while the Johor and Singapore borders are closed, petrol stations at the Second Link must continue to operate; however, there is no business there,\u201d Khairil Annuar said.\n\nHe added that even though petrol stations are running at a loss, they cannot close.\n\n\u201cIt is important for the business to survive and continue supporting the economy,\u201d he said.\n\nPDAM represents some 3,800 petrol dealers nationwide.\n\nRead our earlier

Previously, DeepScience had received an angel investment from InnoAngel Fund.\n\nFounded in April 2016 in Beijing, DeepScience deeply focuses on full-stack real-time animation and virtual live streaming technologies, and has achieved virtual and real image synthesis and digital human-computer interaction functions in a number of commercial fields.\n\nIts products include \u201cDreamMaker Lite\u201d and \u201cDreamMaker Plus\u201d for professional animation content production, \u201cDreamMaker Easy\u201d for fast animation content production and virtual live streaming, as well as the recently-launched \u201cDreamMaker Easy Plug-in\u201d and \u201cVHost\u201d for \u20187*24 hours\u2019 AI virtual live streaming on e-commerce platform.\n\nDeepScience founder David Cheng said compared with traditional Internet applications, realtime animation and virtual live streaming products have a complicated technical process, which involves human-computer interaction, real-time rendering, various AI actions and image processing technologies, and hence, it is not as simple as following the route of system integration.\n\nToward this end, DeepScience has created a triple-barrier to ensure the long-term sustainable development of the enterprise. The first of these is invention patents, whereby DeepScience has applied for 50 invention patents. The second is the development of motion capture, facial expression capture, gesture capture and other underlying technologies. The third area of focus is on various application scenarios around the launch of diversified segmented products.\n\nTo date, DeepScience has already served many well-known IPs in China such as Yichan Little Monk, Momo Girl, Bud Bear and Jiangxiaoyu. Moving forward, DeepScience expects not only to serve more IPs, but to also help IPs better achieve commercial realisation via operation management.\n\nCheng said due to the more developed and diversified e-commerce ecology in China, the development of domestic virtual idol and virtual live streaming industry will increasingly incorporate Chinese characteristics, which is different from Japanese models such as Hatsune Miku and Tripping Love.\n\nFurther, compared with the models in Japan and other countries that emphasise art, the Chinese model is characterised by more emphasis on interaction, faster monetisation and more emphasis on technology. He said that with China already leading the world in the technology of virtual live streaming and a few other fields, it will continue to expand its advantage in the next few years. While in the past, virtual live streaming was mostly based in Japan, now and in the future, virtual live streaming will be led by China, Cheng added.\n\nProducts such as \u201cDreamMaker Easy Plug-in\u201d and \u201cVHost\u201d have been successively launched by DeepScience. The goal of this series of products is to help e-commerce retailers on platforms such as Tmall, Douyin/TikTok and Pinduoduo realise 7*24 hour AI automatic live streaming to sell goods, and continuously improve the effect of generating increasing orders.\n\nGiven that most e-commerce companies do not have their own virtual IP images, DeepScience provides hundreds of free images for customers to use conveniently. These products are particularly popular on Tmall and Douyin/TikTok, and have been used by a number of well-known e-commerce brands such as Schneider, Panasonic Bathroom, Estetin and Membrane Family.\n\nMYEG Capital is the venture investment arm of MYEG.

Pasai Cluster will not be the last, it is the first (of such a severe outbreak), but certainly will not be the last.\n\n\u201cWe need to have a proper research into this and understand the whole environment of the cluster, so that next time, if a longhouse is exposed, we would know how to deal with it effectively and we will not allow it to become so big,\u201d he said.\n\nSibu Municipal Council (SMC) chairman Clarence Ting, who hosted the discussion, had asked why the Pasai Cluster was so severe compared to other clusters .\n\nThe Pasai Cluster, which started in several longhouses in Sibu, was declared by the State Health Department on Jan 9 after 38 positive cases were detected from the cluster including its index case who was found positive on Jan 7.\n\nThe Sarawak Disaster Management Committee (SDMC) yesterday said the Pasai Cluster, has so far recorded a total of 2,363 cases throughout the state.\n\nAs of yesterday, Sibu has contributed 2,041 cases to the state tally of 5,760.\n\nDr Ooi also said that it was not difficult to imagine why Pasai Cluster cases had spread very fast due to the environment and lifestyle in the longhouse.\n\n\u201cEvery longhouse consists of one single house with many \u2018bilik\u2019 or \u2018pintu\u2019. The way of life in the longhouse especially at night or weekend, folks usually sit together at ruai and interact with one another. Relatives also live in the same house.\n\n\u201cWe in Sarawak, we are friendly people, we like to interact. I think that communal spirit and lifestyle also contributed to this,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also said that the fourth wave of Covid-19 outbreak was challenging as it involved both rural areas and spread back to town areas.\n\nHe said most rural folk especially the longhouse folk work in town and would go back to their longhouses every weekend.\n\nDr Ooi, however, believed that Sarawak was still very much in the containment stage and the state could overcome the outbreak if everybody played their parts together.\n\nHe also said that Sibu could learn a lot from the third wave outbreak involving the Greenhill Cluster in Kuching in the effort to bring the cases down.\n\nAccording to him, when Greenhill Cluster was detected, a lot of cases involved friends and relatives. Subsequently, these close contacts then contacted their own friends and relatives.\n\n\u201cSo, a lot of people actually did not wait for the contact tracer to contact them, they were getting involved themselves. This is the key element for us to control and bring the cases down,\u201d Dr Ooi said, adding that Haji Baki Cluster was also another success story.\n\nHe pointed out that each cluster outbreak in Kuching starting from the first outbreak last year usually lasted for a few months before it could be controlled completely.", "keyword": ["suggests", "involved", "study", "sgh", "ooi", "cluster", "longhouse", "state", "sibu", "outbreak", "cases", "consultant", "effectively", "covid", "pasai", "tackle", "longhouses"], "summary": "Pasai Cluster will not be the last, it is the first (of such a severe outbreak), but certainly will not be the last.\nSibu Municipal Council (SMC) chairman Clarence Ting, who hosted the discussion, had asked why the Pasai Cluster was so severe compared to other clusters .\nThe Sarawak Disaster Management Committee (SDMC) yesterday said the Pasai Cluster, has so far recorded a total of 2,363 cases throughout the state.\nAccording to him, when Greenhill Cluster was detected, a lot of cases involved friends and relatives.\nHe pointed out that each cluster outbreak in Kuching starting from the first outbreak last year usually lasted for a few months before it could be controlled completely.", "news": "The Borneo Post", "date": "2021-02-09 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "No law against making an appeal to the King, says Anwar", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wMi8wMi9uby1sYXctYWdhaW5zdC1tYWtpbmctYW4tYXBwZWFsLXRvLXRoZS1raW5nLXNheXMtYW53YXIv0gEA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Ainaa Aiman"], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ANWAR-IBRAHIM-FMT-200220-9-1-1.jpg", "text": "PETALING JAYA: Opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim has asked police to make clear the law under which they are investigating him over his letter to the King appealing for the revocation of the proclamation of emergency.\n\nSaying that there is no law in the country that stops anyone from appealing to the King to rescind his decision, the PKR president questioned the need for him to give a statement to police on the matter.\n\n\u201cI want to ask, what laws do we have in our country (that says this is wrong)?

previous enforcement of MCO in March 2020\n\nby AFIQ AZIZ / pic by TMR FILE\n\nPETROL dealers are in the dark over the issue of fuel ceiling price which has been steadily increasing since mid-November 2020.\n\nWithout a ceiling price, petrol station operators\u2019 cashflow will remain tight as they will have to buy fuel at higher prices, making the cost of holding stocks more expensive, said the Petrol Dealer Association of Malaysia (PDAM).\n\nIts president Datuk Khairul Annuar Abdul Aziz said currently, station owners have yet to recover their losses from the previous enforcement of the Movement Control Order (MCO) in March 2020.\n\nThe stay-at-home orders, he said, have swiped at least 70% of their business revenues.\n\n\u201cSales dropped by 70% when the MCO was called, but dealers managed to slowly recover in October last year, with sales picking up to about 80% compared to the pre-MCO period.\n\n\u201cSo, now that the fuel price is going up, we need to know if the ceiling price is in place or has been revoked.\n\n\u201cIf there is no ceiling price, dealers will hold expensive stock while demand is again affected in MCO 2.0,\u201d Khairul Annuar told The Malaysian Reserve (TMR).\n\nIn June last year, several media agencies reported that the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) had revoked the petrol price control order which restricted the maximum price of RON95 to RM2.08 per litre and diesel to RM2.18 per litre.\n\nThe revocation was announced in a federal gazette titled Price Control and Anti-Profiteering (Determination of Maximum Retail Price for Petrol and Diesel) (No 8) (Revocation) Order 2020 which was dated June 3, approved by KPDNHEP Minister Datuk Alexander Nanta Linggi on April 10.\n\nNanta Linggi clarified that the order on ceiling retail prices of petrol and diesel is still in place.\n\nHe stated that it was actually a change in mechanism to improve the monitoring and enforcement efficiency to counter any violation under the Control of Supplies Act 1961.\n\nHowever, since then, petrol dealers have been kept in the dark, Khairul Annuar said, who demanded KPDNHEP to clarify the matter.\n\n\u201cNow, we are not sure if there is any price capping for the fuel price as the government will need to subsidise it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe previous Pakatan Harapan government had set the ceiling price for RON95 at RM2.08 per litre and diesel at RM2.14 per litre.\n\nRON95 was traded at the high of RM2.08 per litre on March 6, but the price had dipped to the lowest in early May at RM1.25 due to the MCO.\n\nThe price has fluctuated since and steadily went up from RM1.61 on Nov 13 to the current price of RM1.90.\n\nNanta Linggi stated the ministry will only intercept the fuel price through a mechanism when it

Previously, DeepScience had received an angel investment from InnoAngel Fund.\n\nFounded in April 2016 in Beijing, DeepScience deeply focuses on full-stack real-time animation and virtual live streaming technologies, and has achieved virtual and real image synthesis and digital human-computer interaction functions in a number of commercial fields.\n\nIts products include \u201cDreamMaker Lite\u201d and \u201cDreamMaker Plus\u201d for professional animation content production, \u201cDreamMaker Easy\u201d for fast animation content production and virtual live streaming, as well as the recently-launched \u201cDreamMaker Easy Plug-in\u201d and \u201cVHost\u201d for \u20187*24 hours\u2019 AI virtual live streaming on e-commerce platform.\n\nDeepScience founder David Cheng said compared with traditional Internet applications, realtime animation and virtual live streaming products have a complicated technical process, which involves human-computer interaction, real-time rendering, various AI actions and image processing technologies, and hence, it is not as simple as following the route of system integration.\n\nToward this end, DeepScience has created a triple-barrier to ensure the long-term sustainable development of the enterprise. The first of these is invention patents, whereby DeepScience has applied for 50 invention patents. The second is the development of motion capture, facial expression capture, gesture capture and other underlying technologies. The third area of focus is on various application scenarios around the launch of diversified segmented products.\n\nTo date, DeepScience has already served many well-known IPs in China such as Yichan Little Monk, Momo Girl, Bud Bear and Jiangxiaoyu. Moving forward, DeepScience expects not only to serve more IPs, but to also help IPs better achieve commercial realisation via operation management.\n\nCheng said due to the more developed and diversified e-commerce ecology in China, the development of domestic virtual idol and virtual live streaming industry will increasingly incorporate Chinese characteristics, which is different from Japanese models such as Hatsune Miku and Tripping Love.\n\nFurther, compared with the models in Japan and other countries that emphasise art, the Chinese model is characterised by more emphasis on interaction, faster monetisation and more emphasis on technology. He said that with China already leading the world in the technology of virtual live streaming and a few other fields, it will continue to expand its advantage in the next few years. While in the past, virtual live streaming was mostly based in Japan, now and in the future, virtual live streaming will be led by China, Cheng added.\n\nProducts such as \u201cDreamMaker Easy Plug-in\u201d and \u201cVHost\u201d have been successively launched by DeepScience. The goal of this series of products is to help e-commerce retailers on platforms such as Tmall, Douyin/TikTok and Pinduoduo realise 7*24 hour AI automatic live streaming to sell goods, and continuously improve the effect of generating increasing orders.\n\nGiven that most e-commerce companies do not have their own virtual IP images, DeepScience provides hundreds of free images for customers to use conveniently. These products are particularly popular on Tmall and Douyin/TikTok, and have been used by a number of well-known e-commerce brands such as Schneider, Panasonic Bathroom, Estetin and Membrane Family.\n\nMYEG Capital is the venture investment arm of MYEG.

Pasai Cluster will not be the last, it is the first (of such a severe outbreak), but certainly will not be the last.\n\n\u201cWe need to have a proper research into this and understand the whole environment of the cluster, so that next time, if a longhouse is exposed, we would know how to deal with it effectively and we will not allow it to become so big,\u201d he said.\n\nSibu Municipal Council (SMC) chairman Clarence Ting, who hosted the discussion, had asked why the Pasai Cluster was so severe compared to other clusters .\n\nThe Pasai Cluster, which started in several longhouses in Sibu, was declared by the State Health Department on Jan 9 after 38 positive cases were detected from the cluster including its index case who was found positive on Jan 7.\n\nThe Sarawak Disaster Management Committee (SDMC) yesterday said the Pasai Cluster, has so far recorded a total of 2,363 cases throughout the state.\n\nAs of yesterday, Sibu has contributed 2,041 cases to the state tally of 5,760.\n\nDr Ooi also said that it was not difficult to imagine why Pasai Cluster cases had spread very fast due to the environment and lifestyle in the longhouse.\n\n\u201cEvery longhouse consists of one single house with many \u2018bilik\u2019 or \u2018pintu\u2019.

Subsequently, these close contacts then contacted their own friends and relatives.\n\n\u201cSo, a lot of people actually did not wait for the contact tracer to contact them, they were getting involved themselves. This is the key element for us to control and bring the cases down,\u201d Dr Ooi said, adding that Haji Baki Cluster was also another success story.\n\nHe pointed out that each cluster outbreak in Kuching starting from the first outbreak last year usually lasted for a few months before it could be controlled completely.", "keyword": ["suggests", "involved", "study", "sgh", "ooi", "cluster", "longhouse", "state", "sibu", "outbreak", "cases", "consultant", "effectively", "covid", "pasai", "tackle", "longhouses"], "summary": "Pasai Cluster will not be the last, it is the first (of such a severe outbreak), but certainly will not be the last.\nSibu Municipal Council (SMC) chairman Clarence Ting, who hosted the discussion, had asked why the Pasai Cluster was so severe compared to other clusters .\nThe Sarawak Disaster Management Committee (SDMC) yesterday said the Pasai Cluster, has so far recorded a total of 2,363 cases throughout the state.\nAccording to him, when Greenhill Cluster was detected, a lot of cases involved friends and relatives.\nHe pointed out that each cluster outbreak in Kuching starting from the first outbreak last year usually lasted for a few months before it could be controlled completely.", "news": "The Borneo Post", "date": "2021-02-09 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "No law against making an appeal to the King, says Anwar", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wMi8wMi9uby1sYXctYWdhaW5zdC1tYWtpbmctYW4tYXBwZWFsLXRvLXRoZS1raW5nLXNheXMtYW53YXIv0gEA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Ainaa Aiman"], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ANWAR-IBRAHIM-FMT-200220-9-1-1.jpg", "text": "PETALING JAYA: Opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim has asked police to make clear the law under which they are investigating him over his letter to the King appealing for the revocation of the proclamation of emergency.\n\nSaying that there is no law in the country that stops anyone from appealing to the King to rescind his decision, the PKR president questioned the need for him to give a statement to police on the matter.\n\n\u201cI want to ask, what laws do we have in our country (that says this is wrong)?

previous enforcement of MCO in March 2020\n\nby AFIQ AZIZ / pic by TMR FILE\n\nPETROL dealers are in the dark over the issue of fuel ceiling price which has been steadily increasing since mid-November 2020.\n\nWithout a ceiling price, petrol station operators\u2019 cashflow will remain tight as they will have to buy fuel at higher prices, making the cost of holding stocks more expensive, said the Petrol Dealer Association of Malaysia (PDAM).\n\nIts president Datuk Khairul Annuar Abdul Aziz said currently, station owners have yet to recover their losses from the previous enforcement of the Movement Control Order (MCO) in March 2020.\n\nThe stay-at-home orders, he said, have swiped at least 70% of their business revenues.\n\n\u201cSales dropped by 70% when the MCO was called, but dealers managed to slowly recover in October last year, with sales picking up to about 80% compared to the pre-MCO period.\n\n\u201cSo, now that the fuel price is going up, we need to know if the ceiling price is in place or has been revoked.\n\n\u201cIf there is no ceiling price, dealers will hold expensive stock while demand is again affected in MCO 2.0,\u201d Khairul Annuar told The Malaysian Reserve (TMR).\n\nIn June last year, several media agencies reported that the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) had revoked the petrol price control order which restricted the maximum price of RON95 to RM2.08 per litre and diesel to RM2.18 per litre.\n\nThe revocation was announced in a federal gazette titled Price Control and Anti-Profiteering (Determination of Maximum Retail Price for Petrol and Diesel) (No 8) (Revocation) Order 2020 which was dated June 3, approved by KPDNHEP Minister Datuk Alexander Nanta Linggi on April 10.\n\nNanta Linggi clarified that the order on ceiling retail prices of petrol and diesel is still in place.\n\nHe stated that it was actually a change in mechanism to improve the monitoring and enforcement efficiency to counter any violation under the Control of Supplies Act 1961.\n\nHowever, since then, petrol dealers have been kept in the dark, Khairul Annuar said, who demanded KPDNHEP to clarify the matter.\n\n\u201cNow, we are not sure if there is any price capping for the fuel price as the government will need to subsidise it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe previous Pakatan Harapan government had set the ceiling price for RON95 at RM2.08 per litre and diesel at RM2.14 per litre.\n\nRON95 was traded at the high of RM2.08 per litre on March 6, but the price had dipped to the lowest in early May at RM1.25 due to the MCO.\n\nThe price has fluctuated since and steadily went up from RM1.61 on Nov 13 to the current price of RM1.90.\n\nNanta Linggi stated the ministry will only intercept the fuel price through a mechanism when it goes up to a certain level.\n\nA source in the government told TMR that the price ceiling mechanism is still in place and the new price ceiling is expected to be announced by the Finance Ministry.\n\nMeanwhile, Khairul Annuar said more than 10 PDAM members decided to close shop last year due to the tough economic climate caused by the MCO and Covid-19 outbreak.\n\n\u201cSome station operators surrendered their dealership to the oil company and dealers who owned businesses have closed down their stations,\u201d he said.\n\nKhairul Annuar said a ceiling price would allow petrol dealers to breathe, as the current MCO is causing losses like the previous lockdown, especially for those operating at highways.\n\nAlthough the January 2021 MCO allows some sectors to operate, interstate travelling is still restricted.\n\nIf the government introduces a lockdown like last year, Khairul Annuar said all petrol dealers will be bleeding in the next couple of months.\n\n\u201cIt must be noted that the petrol dealer business is essential.\n\n\u201cEven during spikes of Covid-19 cases, we need to open our doors.\n\n\u201cFor example, while the Johor and Singapore borders are closed, petrol stations at the Second Link must continue to operate; however, there is no business there,\u201d Khairil Annuar said.\n\nHe added that even though petrol stations are running at a loss, they cannot close.\n\n\u201cIt is important for the business to survive and continue supporting the economy,\u201d he said.\n\nPDAM represents some 3,800 petrol dealers nationwide.\n\nRead our earlier

The third area of focus is on various application scenarios around the launch of diversified segmented products.\n\nTo date, DeepScience has already served many well-known IPs in China such as Yichan Little Monk, Momo Girl, Bud Bear and Jiangxiaoyu. Moving forward, DeepScience expects not only to serve more IPs, but to also help IPs better achieve commercial realisation via operation management.\n\nCheng said due to the more developed and diversified e-commerce ecology in China, the development of domestic virtual idol and virtual live streaming industry will increasingly incorporate Chinese characteristics, which is different from Japanese models such as Hatsune Miku and Tripping Love.\n\nFurther, compared with the models in Japan and other countries that emphasise art, the Chinese model is characterised by more emphasis on interaction, faster monetisation and more emphasis on technology. He said that with China already leading the world in the technology of virtual live streaming and a few other fields, it will continue to expand its advantage in the next few years. While in the past, virtual live streaming was mostly based in Japan, now and in the future, virtual live streaming will be led by China, Cheng added.\n\nProducts such as \u201cDreamMaker Easy Plug-in\u201d and \u201cVHost\u201d have been successively launched by DeepScience. The goal of this series of products is to help e-commerce retailers on platforms such as Tmall, Douyin/TikTok and Pinduoduo realise 7*24 hour AI automatic live streaming to sell goods, and continuously improve the effect of generating increasing orders.\n\nGiven that most e-commerce companies do not have their own virtual IP images, DeepScience provides hundreds of free images for customers to use conveniently. These products are particularly popular on Tmall and Douyin/TikTok, and have been used by a number of well-known e-commerce brands such as Schneider, Panasonic Bathroom, Estetin and Membrane Family.\n\nMYEG Capital is the venture investment arm of MYEG.

Pasai Cluster will not be the last, it is the first (of such a severe outbreak), but certainly will not be the last.\n\n\u201cWe need to have a proper research into this and understand the whole environment of the cluster, so that next time, if a longhouse is exposed, we would know how to deal with it effectively and we will not allow it to become so big,\u201d he said.\n\nSibu Municipal Council (SMC) chairman Clarence Ting, who hosted the discussion, had asked why the Pasai Cluster was so severe compared to other clusters .\n\nThe Pasai Cluster, which started in several longhouses in Sibu, was declared by the State Health Department on Jan 9 after 38 positive cases were detected from the cluster including its index case who was found positive on Jan 7.\n\nThe Sarawak Disaster Management Committee (SDMC) yesterday said the Pasai Cluster, has so far recorded a total of 2,363 cases throughout the state.\n\nAs of yesterday, Sibu has contributed 2,041 cases to the state tally of 5,760.\n\nDr Ooi also said that it was not difficult to imagine why Pasai Cluster cases had spread very fast due to the environment and lifestyle in the longhouse.\n\n\u201cEvery longhouse consists of one single house with many \u2018bilik\u2019 or \u2018pintu\u2019.

Subsequently, these close contacts then contacted their own friends and relatives.\n\n\u201cSo, a lot of people actually did not wait for the contact tracer to contact them, they were getting involved themselves. This is the key element for us to control and bring the cases down,\u201d Dr Ooi said, adding that Haji Baki Cluster was also another success story.\n\nHe pointed out that each cluster outbreak in Kuching starting from the first outbreak last year usually lasted for a few months before it could be controlled completely.", "keyword": ["suggests", "involved", "study", "sgh", "ooi", "cluster", "longhouse", "state", "sibu", "outbreak", "cases", "consultant", "effectively", "covid", "pasai", "tackle", "longhouses"], "summary": "Pasai Cluster will not be the last, it is the first (of such a severe outbreak), but certainly will not be the last.\nSibu Municipal Council (SMC) chairman Clarence Ting, who hosted the discussion, had asked why the Pasai Cluster was so severe compared to other clusters .\nThe Sarawak Disaster Management Committee (SDMC) yesterday said the Pasai Cluster, has so far recorded a total of 2,363 cases throughout the state.\nAccording to him, when Greenhill Cluster was detected, a lot of cases involved friends and relatives.\nHe pointed out that each cluster outbreak in Kuching starting from the first outbreak last year usually lasted for a few months before it could be controlled completely.", "news": "The Borneo Post", "date": "2021-02-09 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "No law against making an appeal to the King, says Anwar", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wMi8wMi9uby1sYXctYWdhaW5zdC1tYWtpbmctYW4tYXBwZWFsLXRvLXRoZS1raW5nLXNheXMtYW53YXIv0gEA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Ainaa Aiman"], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ANWAR-IBRAHIM-FMT-200220-9-1-1.jpg", "text": "PETALING JAYA: Opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim has asked police to make clear the law under which they are investigating him over his letter to the King appealing for the revocation of the proclamation of emergency.\n\nSaying that there is no law in the country that stops anyone from appealing to the King to rescind his decision, the PKR president questioned the need for him to give a statement to police on the matter.\n\n\u201cI want to ask, what laws do we have in our country (that says this is wrong)?

previous enforcement of MCO in March 2020\n\nby AFIQ AZIZ / pic by TMR FILE\n\nPETROL dealers are in the dark over the issue of fuel ceiling price which has been steadily increasing since mid-November 2020.\n\nWithout a ceiling price, petrol station operators\u2019 cashflow will remain tight as they will have to buy fuel at higher prices, making the cost of holding stocks more expensive, said the Petrol Dealer Association of Malaysia (PDAM).\n\nIts president Datuk Khairul Annuar Abdul Aziz said currently, station owners have yet to recover their losses from the previous enforcement of the Movement Control Order (MCO) in March 2020.\n\nThe stay-at-home orders, he said, have swiped at least 70% of their business revenues.\n\n\u201cSales dropped by 70% when the MCO was called, but dealers managed to slowly recover in October last year, with sales picking up to about 80% compared to the pre-MCO period.\n\n\u201cSo, now that the fuel price is going up, we need to know if the ceiling price is in place or has been revoked.\n\n\u201cIf there is no ceiling price, dealers will hold expensive stock while demand is again affected in MCO 2.0,\u201d Khairul Annuar told The Malaysian Reserve (TMR).\n\nIn June last year, several media agencies reported that the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) had revoked the petrol price control order which restricted the maximum price of RON95 to RM2.08 per litre and diesel to RM2.18 per litre.\n\nThe revocation was announced in a federal gazette titled Price Control and Anti-Profiteering (Determination of Maximum Retail Price for Petrol and Diesel) (No 8) (Revocation) Order 2020 which was dated June 3, approved by KPDNHEP Minister Datuk Alexander Nanta Linggi on April 10.\n\nNanta Linggi clarified that the order on ceiling retail prices of petrol and diesel is still in place.\n\nHe stated that it was actually a change in mechanism to improve the monitoring and enforcement efficiency to counter any violation under the Control of Supplies Act 1961.\n\nHowever, since then, petrol dealers have been kept in the dark, Khairul Annuar said, who demanded KPDNHEP to clarify the matter.\n\n\u201cNow, we are not sure if there is any price capping for the fuel price as the government will need to subsidise it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe previous Pakatan Harapan government had set the ceiling price for RON95 at RM2.08 per litre and diesel at RM2.14 per litre.\n\nRON95 was traded at the high of RM2.08 per litre on March 6, but the price had dipped to the lowest in early May at RM1.25 due to the MCO.\n\nThe price has fluctuated since and steadily went up from RM1.61 on Nov 13 to the current price of RM1.90.\n\nNanta Linggi stated the ministry will only intercept the fuel price through a mechanism when it goes up to a certain level.\n\nA source in the government told TMR that the price ceiling mechanism is still in place and the new price ceiling is expected to be announced by the Finance Ministry.\n\nMeanwhile, Khairul Annuar said more than 10 PDAM members decided to close shop last year due to the tough economic climate caused by the MCO and Covid-19 outbreak.\n\n\u201cSome station operators surrendered their dealership to the oil company and dealers who owned businesses have closed down their stations,\u201d he said.\n\nKhairul Annuar said a ceiling price would allow petrol dealers to breathe, as the current MCO is causing losses like the previous lockdown, especially for those operating at highways.\n\nAlthough the January 2021 MCO allows some sectors to operate, interstate travelling is still restricted.\n\nIf the government introduces a lockdown like last year, Khairul Annuar said all petrol dealers will be bleeding in the next couple of months.\n\n\u201cIt must be noted that the petrol dealer business is essential.\n\n\u201cEven during spikes of Covid-19 cases, we need to open our doors.\n\n\u201cFor example, while the Johor and Singapore borders are closed, petrol stations at the Second Link must continue to operate; however, there is no business there,\u201d Khairil Annuar said.\n\nHe added that even though petrol stations are running at a loss, they cannot close.\n\n\u201cIt is important for the business to survive and continue supporting the economy,\u201d he said.\n\nPDAM represents some 3,800 petrol dealers nationwide.\n\nRead our earlier

Previously, DeepScience had received an angel investment from InnoAngel Fund.\n\nFounded in April 2016 in Beijing, DeepScience deeply focuses on full-stack real-time animation and virtual live streaming technologies, and has achieved virtual and real image synthesis and digital human-computer interaction functions in a number of commercial fields.\n\nIts products include \u201cDreamMaker Lite\u201d and \u201cDreamMaker Plus\u201d for professional animation content production, \u201cDreamMaker Easy\u201d for fast animation content production and virtual live streaming, as well as the recently-launched \u201cDreamMaker Easy Plug-in\u201d and \u201cVHost\u201d for \u20187*24 hours\u2019 AI virtual live streaming on e-commerce platform.\n\nDeepScience founder David Cheng said compared with traditional Internet applications, realtime animation and virtual live streaming products have a complicated technical process, which involves human-computer interaction, real-time rendering, various AI actions and image processing technologies, and hence, it is not as simple as following the route of system integration.\n\nToward this end, DeepScience has created a triple-barrier to ensure the long-term sustainable development of the enterprise. The first of these is invention patents, whereby DeepScience has applied for 50 invention patents. The second is the development of motion capture, facial expression capture, gesture capture and other underlying technologies. The third area of focus is on various application scenarios around the launch of diversified segmented products.\n\nTo date, DeepScience has already served many well-known IPs in China such as Yichan Little Monk, Momo Girl, Bud Bear and Jiangxiaoyu. Moving forward, DeepScience expects not only to serve more IPs, but to also help IPs better achieve commercial realisation via operation management.\n\nCheng said due to the more developed and diversified e-commerce ecology in China, the development of domestic virtual idol and virtual live streaming industry will increasingly incorporate Chinese characteristics, which is different from Japanese models such as Hatsune Miku and Tripping Love.\n\nFurther, compared with the models in Japan and other countries that emphasise art, the Chinese model is characterised by more emphasis on interaction, faster monetisation and more emphasis on technology. He said that with China already leading the world in the technology of virtual live streaming and a few other fields, it will continue to expand its advantage in the next few years. While in the past, virtual live streaming was mostly based in Japan, now and in the future, virtual live streaming will be led by China, Cheng added.\n\nProducts such as \u201cDreamMaker Easy Plug-in\u201d and \u201cVHost\u201d have been successively launched by DeepScience. The goal of this series of products is to help e-commerce retailers on platforms such as Tmall, Douyin/TikTok and Pinduoduo realise 7*24 hour AI automatic live streaming to sell goods, and continuously improve the effect of generating increasing orders.\n\nGiven that most e-commerce companies do not have their own virtual IP images, DeepScience provides hundreds of free images for customers to use conveniently. These products are particularly popular on Tmall and Douyin/TikTok, and have been used by a number of well-known e-commerce brands such as Schneider, Panasonic Bathroom, Estetin and Membrane Family.\n\nMYEG Capital is the venture investment arm of MYEG.

Face this reality democratically, don\u2019t resort to threats,\u201d he said, referring to the government.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["lost", "law", "appealing", "mps", "reportedly", "matter", "majority", "anwar", "making", "emergency", "proclamation", "appeal", "king"], "summary": "PETALING JAYA: Opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim has asked police to make clear the law under which they are investigating him over his letter to the King appealing for the revocation of the proclamation of emergency.\n\u201cI hope the police can carry out their duties professionally.\u201dOn Jan 27, it was reported that police had begun an investigation into Anwar\u2019s call for the King to rescind the emergency proclamation.\nIn reply, Anwar said he was simply appealing to the King in his letter.\nAnwar, who is also Port Dickson MP, claimed this was the real reason behind the suspension of Parliament.\n\u201cYou have lost in the political arena and have lost majority.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-02-02 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}]
