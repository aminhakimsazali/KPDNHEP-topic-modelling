could register a surprise narrower decline of 0.6% year-on-year (y-o-y) for first-quarter 2021 (Q1\u201921), compared with a 3.4% y-o-y contraction in Q4\u201920 despite the reimplementation of movement control order 2.0 (MCO 2.0) from Jan 13 to March 4, 2021, according to BIMB Securities Research.\n\n\u201cA robust recovery in manufacturing and external trade activities alongside ongoing policy support are seen as key factors mitigating the impact of stricter containment measures and aiding the recovery last quarter,\u201d it stated in a report.\n\nBank Negara Malaysia will announce the first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) numbers tomorrow.\n\nThe research house said the latest data, which showed industrial production index (IPI) growth of 3.9%, stronger manufacturing growth of 6.8% as well as modest contraction in mining of 4.1% and electricity at 0.1%, confirmed its views of a narrower GDP print for the quarter.\n\nIt said its projection is also supported by a slew of improving figures for Q1\u201921 on a y-o-y basis, from a pickup in export growth of 18.2%, lower contraction of 10.5% in value of construction work done and a smaller services contraction of 3.6%.\n\nThe country saw a 1.5% improvement in volume index of wholesale & retail trade and a 13.7 point improvement in the Malaysian Institute of Economic Research\u2019s (MIER) consumer sentiment index to 98.9 points, the highest reading in tenquarters which pointed to better consumer confidence, among others.\n\nBIMB Securities Research noted that although Malaysia contended with a severe resurgence in Covid-19 cases that peaked in February and tighter restrictions that dampened the revival of domestic consumption, the economy benefited from a relatively strong trade position.\n\n\u201cExports were supported by recovering global demand for manufactured goods and bolstered by a surge in global demand for semiconductors,\u201d it said.\n\nThe research house acknowledged the sizeable gains in exports over the March quarter more than likely offset the softness in domestic consumption as producers benefitted from recovering global demand for manufactured goods, while the net position was bolstered by global demand for semiconductors and recovering commodity prices. However, sectoral discrepancies remain, especially for the persistent underperformers in services and onstruction.\n\nWhile certain industries remained positive or improved from the previous quarter, it noted tourism-related segments \u2013such as accommodation, food & beverage, and transport & storage \u2013 continued to be weighed down by the ongoing containment measures.\n\nConstruction activity, meanwhile, has been affected by shortage of foreign workers and slow commencement of government projects.\n\nBIMB Securities Research stated the economy is expected to track a firmer recovery path from Q2\u201921 onwards due to the base effect and underpinned by sizeable fiscal measures and gradual reopening of the economy.\n\nAlthough it is concerned about the spread of new strains of Covid-19 and alarming rise in the number of infections locally and abroad, the base effect and strong exports could aid this year\u2019s second quarter growth to accelerate depending on the impact of the stimulus spending and a smooth vaccine rollout.\n\nOverall, BIMB Securities Research opined that the 2021 growth outlook has improved for the Malaysia economy, on the back of supportive domestic policies and sound macro fundamentals, but the recovery remains uneven.\n\nIt noted the labour market picture is clearly improving but not quite back to pre-pandemic business-as-usual situation.\n\n\u201cThe latest tightening of measures under MCO 3.0 and lingering uncertainties are expected to weigh on the economy in the near term but not derail the recovery.\u201d\n\nThe research house opined that the impact of MCO 3.0 is expected to be less severe with most key economic sectors allowed to operate and measures in place to mitigate negative effects.\n\n\u201cThe swift and sizeable economic policies as well as easy monetary conditions have been crucial in supporting the economy. These should continue together with sustained vigilance against a resurgence of infections,\u201d it said.\n\nBIMB Securities Research said the balance of risks has tilted to firmer growth, albeit with remaining pockets of weakness. It is maintaining its 2021 GDP growth projection of 5.1% on the back a low base effect and a strong pickup in global demand induced by Covid-19 vaccination efforts, barring an unforeseen risk of an

deposits solely due to shifting demands\n\nby NUR HANANI AZMAN / pic by BLOOMBERG\n\nTHERE is no price increase for Covid-19 treatment at private hospitals, particularly in the Klang Valley, although the recent rise in new cases has piled more pressure on the country\u2019s healthcare system.\n\nAssociation of Private Hospitals Malaysia (APHM) president Datuk Dr Kuljit Singh said hospitals do not have the prerogative to raise admission charges and direct deposits solely due to shifting demands.\n\nHe said the cost for Covid-19 patients with pneumonia (an infection that inflames the lungs\u2019 air sacs) is almost the same as non-Covid patients, save for a little extra cost for personal protective equipment for staff.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to determine the average cost for Covid-19 treatment because it is based on each hospital\u2019s structure and capacity.\n\nBut the price will not be so different between private hospitals. Only the patients will know the cost.\n\n\u201cDifferent hospitals will have different mechanisms. It depends on how many patients they can accommodate in the intensive care unit (ICU) and in normal wards. Not all doctors can treat Covid-19,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve (TMR).\n\nPrivate hospitals have been admitting Covid-19 patients since January after a surge in new cases left the government scrambling for more beds and medical staff in managing the pandemic, particularly for those who can afford treatment.\n\nPrivate hospitals provide beds and expertise based on their respective capacity and capability, with thousands of patients having been treated up until today.\n\nDr Kuljit said all private hospitals are transparent in giving the cost estimation, depending on the level of care needed and the number of hospitalised days, to let the patient decide whether to proceed with treatment.\n\n\u201cHowever, most private hospitals in the Klang Valley are not able to accept any more Covid-19 patients as the wards allocated to treat these cases are full.\n\n\u201cPrivate hospitals are constrained on the number of beds and ICU facilities that can accommodate Covid-19 patients, and the availability of specialists and nurses, which further compounds the restriction,\u201d he added.\n\nA general survey by TMR found the treatment cost per day for a non-critical Covid-19 case at Sunway Medical Centre in Petaling Jaya, Selangor, is between RM1,500 and RM2,500 with a deposit of RM10,000 to RM20,000.\n\n\u201cThe treatment cost for ICU is different depending on the patient\u2019s critical treatment needs. For now, we can only accept 25 Covid-19 patients including in ICU. We have 50 patients on the waiting list,\u201d according to a Sunway Medical Centre spokesperson.\n\nSubang Jaya Medical Centre (SJMC) has also reached full capacity at the moment. However, the hospital does not have a waiting list.\n\nThe cost per day and deposit at SJMC depend on the level of illness, with levels ranging from mild to moderate, followed by serious to critical.\n\n\u201cThe admission rate for mild cases is at RM2,000 per day with a deposit between RM10,000 and RM20,000. For moderate Covid-19 cases, the charge is RM4,000 per day with a RM15,000 deposit. For seriously ill patients, who require treatment at ICU facilities, the charge is between RM6,000 and RM8,000 a day with a deposit of RM30,000.\n\n\u201cFor critical patients, the charge is RM12,000 per day with a RM50,000 deposit,\u201d an SJMC spokesperson said. Other private hospitals declined to comment on their rates when contacted by TMR.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, APHM expressed its hopes that doctors in government hospitals would refer their non-Covid-19 patients to private hospitals for elective surgeries and procedures without further delay.\n\nThis was in response to an updated circular by the Ministry of Health allowing government hospitals to outsource services to private hospitals to treat non-Covid patients, in order to create more treatment space for Covid-19 patients in public hospitals.\n\nPrivate hospitals in this country have the capacity to assist in managing non-Covid-19 patients effectively, allowing public hospitals to focus on treating Covid-19 cases.\n\n\u201cTreatment of non-Covid-19 patients in private hospitals will be funded by the government based on the circular, but patients can only be referred by their treating doctors in the public hospitals to private based on the condition of the ailment,\u201d Dr Kuljit noted in the statement.\n\nHe added that the take up was not satisfactory as only a small number of referrals have been made.\n\nDr Kuljit noted that there were 31 private hospitals in the Klang Valley currently managing Covid-19 patients in normal wards, as well as in the ICU.", "keyword": ["treatment", "icu", "patients", "deposit", "hike", "price", "private", "cost",

The militia, armed mainly with hunting rifles, said it had pulled back to spare civilians from being caught in the crossfire.\n\nSeveral residents reached by Reuters said food was in short supply and estimated as many as 5,000 to 8,000 people had fled the town. Roads were blocked and the presence of troops in the streets was preventing their return.\n\n\"Almost everyone left the city,\" said a volunteer fighter who said she was in a jungle. \"Most of them are in hiding.\"\n\nThe United States and Britain have called on the army to avoid civilian casualties and a shadow National Unity Government formed by loyalists of Suu Kyi appealed for international help.\n\nA U.N.

could register a surprise narrower decline of 0.6% year-on-year (y-o-y) for first-quarter 2021 (Q1\u201921), compared with a 3.4% y-o-y contraction in Q4\u201920 despite the reimplementation of movement control order 2.0 (MCO 2.0) from Jan 13 to March 4, 2021, according to BIMB Securities Research.\n\n\u201cA robust recovery in manufacturing and external trade activities alongside ongoing policy support are seen as key factors mitigating the impact of stricter containment measures and aiding the recovery last quarter,\u201d it stated in a report.\n\nBank Negara Malaysia will announce the first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) numbers tomorrow.\n\nThe research house said the latest data, which showed industrial production index (IPI) growth of 3.9%, stronger manufacturing growth of 6.8% as well as modest contraction in mining of 4.1% and electricity at 0.1%, confirmed its views of a narrower GDP print for the quarter.\n\nIt said its projection is also supported by a slew of improving figures for Q1\u201921 on a y-o-y basis, from a pickup in export growth of 18.2%, lower contraction of 10.5% in value of construction work done and a smaller services contraction of 3.6%.\n\nThe country saw a 1.5% improvement in volume index of wholesale & retail trade and a 13.7 point improvement in the Malaysian Institute of Economic Research\u2019s (MIER) consumer sentiment index to 98.9 points, the highest reading in tenquarters which pointed to better consumer confidence, among others.\n\nBIMB Securities Research noted that although Malaysia contended with a severe resurgence in Covid-19 cases that peaked in February and tighter restrictions that dampened the revival of domestic consumption, the economy benefited from a relatively strong trade position.\n\n\u201cExports were supported by recovering global demand for manufactured goods and bolstered by a surge in global demand for semiconductors,\u201d it said.\n\nThe research house acknowledged the sizeable gains in exports over the March quarter more than likely offset the softness in domestic consumption as producers benefitted from recovering global demand for manufactured goods, while the net position was bolstered by global demand for semiconductors and recovering commodity prices. However, sectoral discrepancies remain, especially for the persistent underperformers in services and onstruction.\n\nWhile certain industries remained positive or improved from the previous quarter, it noted tourism-related segments \u2013such as accommodation, food & beverage, and transport & storage \u2013 continued to be weighed down by the ongoing containment measures.\n\nConstruction activity, meanwhile, has been affected by shortage of foreign workers and slow commencement of government projects.\n\nBIMB Securities Research stated the economy is expected to track a firmer recovery path from Q2\u201921 onwards due to the base effect and underpinned by sizeable fiscal measures and gradual reopening of the economy.\n\nAlthough it is concerned about the spread of new strains of Covid-19 and alarming rise in the number of infections locally and abroad, the base effect and strong exports could aid this year\u2019s second quarter growth to accelerate depending on the impact of the stimulus spending and a smooth vaccine rollout.\n\nOverall, BIMB Securities Research opined that the 2021 growth outlook has improved for the Malaysia economy, on the back of supportive domestic policies and sound macro fundamentals, but the recovery remains uneven.\n\nIt noted the labour market picture is clearly improving but not quite back to pre-pandemic business-as-usual situation.\n\n\u201cThe latest tightening of measures under MCO 3.0 and lingering uncertainties are expected to weigh on the economy in the near term but not derail the recovery.\u201d\n\nThe research house opined that the impact of MCO 3.0 is expected to be less severe with most key economic sectors allowed to operate and measures in place to mitigate negative effects.\n\n\u201cThe swift and sizeable economic policies as well as easy monetary conditions have been crucial in supporting the economy. These should continue together with sustained vigilance against a resurgence of infections,\u201d it said.\n\nBIMB Securities Research said the balance of risks has tilted to firmer growth, albeit with remaining pockets of weakness. It is maintaining its 2021 GDP growth projection of 5.1% on the back a low base effect and a strong pickup in global demand induced by Covid-19 vaccination efforts, barring an unforeseen risk of an

deposits solely due to shifting demands\n\nby NUR HANANI AZMAN / pic by BLOOMBERG\n\nTHERE is no price increase for Covid-19 treatment at private hospitals, particularly in the Klang Valley, although the recent rise in new cases has piled more pressure on the country\u2019s healthcare system.\n\nAssociation of Private Hospitals Malaysia (APHM) president Datuk Dr Kuljit Singh said hospitals do not have the prerogative to raise admission charges and direct deposits solely due to shifting demands.\n\nHe said the cost for Covid-19 patients with pneumonia (an infection that inflames the lungs\u2019 air sacs) is almost the same as non-Covid patients, save for a little extra cost for personal protective equipment for staff.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to determine the average cost for Covid-19 treatment because it is based on each hospital\u2019s structure and capacity.\n\nBut the price will not be so different between private hospitals. Only the patients will know the cost.\n\n\u201cDifferent hospitals will have different mechanisms. It depends on how many patients they can accommodate in the intensive care unit (ICU) and in normal wards. Not all doctors can treat Covid-19,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve (TMR).\n\nPrivate hospitals have been admitting Covid-19 patients since January after a surge in new cases left the government scrambling for more beds and medical staff in managing the pandemic, particularly for those who can afford treatment.\n\nPrivate hospitals provide beds and expertise based on their respective capacity and capability, with thousands of patients having been treated up until today.\n\nDr Kuljit said all private hospitals are transparent in giving the cost estimation, depending on the level of care needed and the number of hospitalised days, to let the patient decide whether to proceed with treatment.\n\n\u201cHowever, most private hospitals in the Klang Valley are not able to accept any more Covid-19 patients as the wards allocated to treat these cases are full.\n\n\u201cPrivate hospitals are constrained on the number of beds and ICU facilities that can accommodate Covid-19 patients, and the availability of specialists and nurses, which further compounds the restriction,\u201d he added.\n\nA general survey by TMR found the treatment cost per day for a non-critical Covid-19 case at Sunway Medical Centre in Petaling Jaya, Selangor, is between RM1,500 and RM2,500 with a deposit of RM10,000 to RM20,000.\n\n\u201cThe treatment cost for ICU is different depending on the patient\u2019s critical treatment needs. For now, we can only accept 25 Covid-19 patients including in ICU. We have 50 patients on the waiting list,\u201d according to a Sunway Medical Centre spokesperson.\n\nSubang Jaya Medical Centre (SJMC) has also reached full capacity at the moment. However, the hospital does not have a waiting list.\n\nThe cost per day and deposit at SJMC depend on the level of illness, with levels ranging from mild to moderate, followed by serious to critical.\n\n\u201cThe admission rate for mild cases is at RM2,000 per day with a deposit between RM10,000 and RM20,000. For moderate Covid-19 cases, the charge is RM4,000 per day with a RM15,000 deposit. For seriously ill patients, who require treatment at ICU facilities, the charge is between RM6,000 and RM8,000 a day with a deposit of RM30,000.\n\n\u201cFor critical patients, the charge is RM12,000 per day with a RM50,000 deposit,\u201d an SJMC spokesperson said. Other private hospitals declined to comment on their rates when contacted by TMR.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, APHM expressed its hopes that doctors in government hospitals would refer their non-Covid-19 patients to private hospitals for elective surgeries and procedures without further delay.\n\nThis was in response to an updated circular by the Ministry of Health allowing government hospitals to outsource services to private hospitals to treat non-Covid patients, in order to create more treatment space for Covid-19 patients in public hospitals.\n\nPrivate hospitals in this country have the capacity to assist in managing non-Covid-19 patients effectively, allowing public hospitals to focus on treating Covid-19 cases.\n\n\u201cTreatment of non-Covid-19 patients in private hospitals will be funded by the government based on the circular, but patients can only be referred by their treating doctors in the public hospitals to private based on the condition of the ailment,\u201d Dr Kuljit noted in the statement.\n\nHe added that the take up was not satisfactory as only a small number of referrals have been made.\n\nDr Kuljit noted that there were 31 private hospitals in the Klang Valley currently managing Covid-19 patients in normal wards, as well as in the ICU.", "keyword": ["treatment", "icu", "patients", "deposit", "hike", "price", "private", "cost",

Bas Malaysia\u2019s (GAPP) vice-president Wan Shairi Wan Ahmad said the other three reportedly died from heart disease.\n\nWorried with this development, which he said was related to debts incurred with loss of income because of Covid-19, he has suggested that tour bus drivers be given counselling to help them manage psychological and emotional stress.\n\nAccording to Bernama, Wan Shairi said

could register a surprise narrower decline of 0.6% year-on-year (y-o-y) for first-quarter 2021 (Q1\u201921), compared with a 3.4% y-o-y contraction in Q4\u201920 despite the reimplementation of movement control order 2.0 (MCO 2.0) from Jan 13 to March 4, 2021, according to BIMB Securities Research.\n\n\u201cA robust recovery in manufacturing and external trade activities alongside ongoing policy support are seen as key factors mitigating the impact of stricter containment measures and aiding the recovery last quarter,\u201d it stated in a report.\n\nBank Negara Malaysia will announce the first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) numbers tomorrow.\n\nThe research house said the latest data, which showed industrial production index (IPI) growth of 3.9%, stronger manufacturing growth of 6.8% as well as modest contraction in mining of 4.1% and electricity at 0.1%, confirmed its views of a narrower GDP print for the quarter.\n\nIt said its projection is also supported by a slew of improving figures for Q1\u201921 on a y-o-y basis, from a pickup in export growth of 18.2%, lower contraction of 10.5% in value of construction work done and a smaller services contraction of 3.6%.\n\nThe country saw a 1.5% improvement in volume index of wholesale & retail trade and a 13.7 point improvement in the Malaysian Institute of Economic Research\u2019s (MIER) consumer sentiment index to 98.9 points, the highest reading in tenquarters which pointed to better consumer confidence, among others.\n\nBIMB Securities Research noted that although Malaysia contended with a severe resurgence in Covid-19 cases that peaked in February and tighter restrictions that dampened the revival of domestic consumption, the economy benefited from a relatively strong trade position.\n\n\u201cExports were supported by recovering global demand for manufactured goods and bolstered by a surge in global demand for semiconductors,\u201d it said.\n\nThe research house acknowledged the sizeable gains in exports over the March quarter more than likely offset the softness in domestic consumption as producers benefitted from recovering global demand for manufactured goods, while the net position was bolstered by global demand for semiconductors and recovering commodity prices. However, sectoral discrepancies remain, especially for the persistent underperformers in services and onstruction.\n\nWhile certain industries remained positive or improved from the previous quarter, it noted tourism-related segments \u2013such as accommodation, food & beverage, and transport & storage \u2013 continued to be weighed down by the ongoing containment measures.\n\nConstruction activity, meanwhile, has been affected by shortage of foreign workers and slow commencement of government projects.\n\nBIMB Securities Research stated the economy is expected to track a firmer recovery path from Q2\u201921 onwards due to the base effect and underpinned by sizeable fiscal measures and gradual reopening of the economy.\n\nAlthough it is concerned about the spread of new strains of Covid-19 and alarming rise in the number of infections locally and abroad, the base effect and strong exports could aid this year\u2019s second quarter growth to accelerate depending on the impact of the stimulus spending and a smooth vaccine rollout.\n\nOverall, BIMB Securities Research opined that the 2021 growth outlook has improved for the Malaysia economy, on the back of supportive domestic policies and sound macro fundamentals, but the recovery remains uneven.\n\nIt noted the labour market picture is clearly improving but not quite back to pre-pandemic business-as-usual situation.\n\n\u201cThe latest tightening of measures under MCO 3.0 and lingering uncertainties are expected to weigh on the economy in the near term but not derail the recovery.\u201d\n\nThe research house opined that the impact of MCO 3.0 is expected to be less severe with most key economic sectors allowed to operate and measures in place to mitigate negative effects.\n\n\u201cThe swift and sizeable economic policies as well as easy monetary conditions have been crucial in supporting the economy. These should continue together with sustained vigilance against a resurgence of infections,\u201d it said.\n\nBIMB Securities Research said the balance of risks has tilted to firmer growth, albeit with remaining pockets of weakness. It is maintaining its 2021 GDP growth projection of 5.1% on the back a low base effect and a strong pickup in global demand induced by Covid-19 vaccination efforts, barring an unforeseen risk of an

deposits solely due to shifting demands\n\nby NUR HANANI AZMAN / pic by BLOOMBERG\n\nTHERE is no price increase for Covid-19 treatment at private hospitals, particularly in the Klang Valley, although the recent rise in new cases has piled more pressure on the country\u2019s healthcare system.\n\nAssociation of Private Hospitals Malaysia (APHM) president Datuk Dr Kuljit Singh said hospitals do not have the prerogative to raise admission charges and direct deposits solely due to shifting demands.\n\nHe said the cost for Covid-19 patients with pneumonia (an infection that inflames the lungs\u2019 air sacs) is almost the same as non-Covid patients, save for a little extra cost for personal protective equipment for staff.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to determine the average cost for Covid-19 treatment because it is based on each hospital\u2019s structure and capacity.\n\nBut the price will not be so different between private hospitals. Only the patients will know the cost.\n\n\u201cDifferent hospitals will have different mechanisms. It depends on how many patients they can accommodate in the intensive care unit (ICU) and in normal wards. Not all doctors can treat Covid-19,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve (TMR).\n\nPrivate hospitals have been admitting Covid-19 patients since January after a surge in new cases left the government scrambling for more beds and medical staff in managing the pandemic, particularly for those who can afford treatment.\n\nPrivate hospitals provide beds and expertise based on their respective capacity and capability, with thousands of patients having been treated up until today.\n\nDr Kuljit said all private hospitals are transparent in giving the cost estimation, depending on the level of care needed and the number of hospitalised days, to let the patient decide whether to proceed with treatment.\n\n\u201cHowever, most private hospitals in the Klang Valley are not able to accept any more Covid-19 patients as the wards allocated to treat these cases are full.\n\n\u201cPrivate hospitals are constrained on the number of beds and ICU facilities that can accommodate Covid-19 patients, and the availability of specialists and nurses, which further compounds the restriction,\u201d he added.\n\nA general survey by TMR found the treatment cost per day for a non-critical Covid-19 case at Sunway Medical Centre in Petaling Jaya, Selangor, is between RM1,500 and RM2,500 with a deposit of RM10,000 to RM20,000.\n\n\u201cThe treatment cost for ICU is different depending on the patient\u2019s critical treatment needs. For now, we can only accept 25 Covid-19 patients including in ICU. We have 50 patients on the waiting list,\u201d according to a Sunway Medical Centre spokesperson.\n\nSubang Jaya Medical Centre (SJMC) has also reached full capacity at the moment. However, the hospital does not have a waiting list.\n\nThe cost per day and deposit at SJMC depend on the level of illness, with levels ranging from mild to moderate, followed by serious to critical.\n\n\u201cThe admission rate for mild cases is at RM2,000 per day with a deposit between RM10,000 and RM20,000. For moderate Covid-19 cases, the charge is RM4,000 per day with a RM15,000 deposit. For seriously ill patients, who require treatment at ICU facilities, the charge is between RM6,000 and RM8,000 a day with a deposit of RM30,000.\n\n\u201cFor critical patients, the charge is RM12,000 per day with a RM50,000 deposit,\u201d an SJMC spokesperson said. Other private hospitals declined to comment on their rates when contacted by TMR.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, APHM expressed its hopes that doctors in government hospitals would refer their non-Covid-19 patients to private hospitals for elective surgeries and procedures without further delay.\n\nThis was in response to an updated circular by the Ministry of Health allowing government hospitals to outsource services to private hospitals to treat non-Covid patients, in order to create more treatment space for Covid-19 patients in public hospitals.\n\nPrivate hospitals in this country have the capacity to assist in managing non-Covid-19 patients effectively, allowing public hospitals to focus on treating Covid-19 cases.\n\n\u201cTreatment of non-Covid-19 patients in private hospitals will be funded by the government based on the circular, but patients can only be referred by their treating doctors in the public hospitals to private based on the condition of the ailment,\u201d Dr Kuljit noted in the statement.\n\nHe added that the take up was not satisfactory as only a small number of referrals have been made.\n\nDr Kuljit noted that there were 31 private hospitals in the Klang Valley currently managing Covid-19 patients in normal wards, as well as in the ICU.", "keyword": ["treatment", "icu", "patients", "deposit", "hike", "price", "private", "cost",

The militia, armed mainly with hunting rifles, said it had pulled back to spare civilians from being caught in the crossfire.\n\nSeveral residents reached by Reuters said food was in short supply and estimated as many as 5,000 to 8,000 people had fled the town.

could register a surprise narrower decline of 0.6% year-on-year (y-o-y) for first-quarter 2021 (Q1\u201921), compared with a 3.4% y-o-y contraction in Q4\u201920 despite the reimplementation of movement control order 2.0 (MCO 2.0) from Jan 13 to March 4, 2021, according to BIMB Securities Research.\n\n\u201cA robust recovery in manufacturing and external trade activities alongside ongoing policy support are seen as key factors mitigating the impact of stricter containment measures and aiding the recovery last quarter,\u201d it stated in a report.\n\nBank Negara Malaysia will announce the first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) numbers tomorrow.\n\nThe research house said the latest data, which showed industrial production index (IPI) growth of 3.9%, stronger manufacturing growth of 6.8% as well as modest contraction in mining of 4.1% and electricity at 0.1%, confirmed its views of a narrower GDP print for the quarter.\n\nIt said its projection is also supported by a slew of improving figures for Q1\u201921 on a y-o-y basis, from a pickup in export growth of 18.2%, lower contraction of 10.5% in value of construction work done and a smaller services contraction of 3.6%.\n\nThe country saw a 1.5% improvement in volume index of wholesale & retail trade and a 13.7 point improvement in the Malaysian Institute of Economic Research\u2019s (MIER) consumer sentiment index to 98.9 points, the highest reading in tenquarters which pointed to better consumer confidence, among others.\n\nBIMB Securities Research noted that although Malaysia contended with a severe resurgence in Covid-19 cases that peaked in February and tighter restrictions that dampened the revival of domestic consumption, the economy benefited from a relatively strong trade position.\n\n\u201cExports were supported by recovering global demand for manufactured goods and bolstered by a surge in global demand for semiconductors,\u201d it said.\n\nThe research house acknowledged the sizeable gains in exports over the March quarter more than likely offset the softness in domestic consumption as producers benefitted from recovering global demand for manufactured goods, while the net position was bolstered by global demand for semiconductors and recovering commodity prices. However, sectoral discrepancies remain, especially for the persistent underperformers in services and onstruction.\n\nWhile certain industries remained positive or improved from the previous quarter, it noted tourism-related segments \u2013such as accommodation, food & beverage, and transport & storage \u2013 continued to be weighed down by the ongoing containment measures.\n\nConstruction activity, meanwhile, has been affected by shortage of foreign workers and slow commencement of government projects.\n\nBIMB Securities Research stated the economy is expected to track a firmer recovery path from Q2\u201921 onwards due to the base effect and underpinned by sizeable fiscal measures and gradual reopening of the economy.\n\nAlthough it is concerned about the spread of new strains of Covid-19 and alarming rise in the number of infections locally and abroad, the base effect and strong exports could aid this year\u2019s second quarter growth to accelerate depending on the impact of the stimulus spending and a smooth vaccine rollout.\n\nOverall, BIMB Securities Research opined that the 2021 growth outlook has improved for the Malaysia economy, on the back of supportive domestic policies and sound macro fundamentals, but the recovery remains uneven.\n\nIt noted the labour market picture is clearly improving but not quite back to pre-pandemic business-as-usual situation.\n\n\u201cThe latest tightening of measures under MCO 3.0 and lingering uncertainties are expected to weigh on the economy in the near term but not derail the recovery.\u201d\n\nThe research house opined that the impact of MCO 3.0 is expected to be less severe with most key economic sectors allowed to operate and measures in place to mitigate negative effects.\n\n\u201cThe swift and sizeable economic policies as well as easy monetary conditions have been crucial in supporting the economy. These should continue together with sustained vigilance against a resurgence of infections,\u201d it said.\n\nBIMB Securities Research said the balance of risks has tilted to firmer growth, albeit with remaining pockets of weakness. It is maintaining its 2021 GDP growth projection of 5.1% on the back a low base effect and a strong pickup in global demand induced by Covid-19 vaccination efforts, barring an unforeseen risk of an

deposits solely due to shifting demands\n\nby NUR HANANI AZMAN / pic by BLOOMBERG\n\nTHERE is no price increase for Covid-19 treatment at private hospitals, particularly in the Klang Valley, although the recent rise in new cases has piled more pressure on the country\u2019s healthcare system.\n\nAssociation of Private Hospitals Malaysia (APHM) president Datuk Dr Kuljit Singh said hospitals do not have the prerogative to raise admission charges and direct deposits solely due to shifting demands.\n\nHe said the cost for Covid-19 patients with pneumonia (an infection that inflames the lungs\u2019 air sacs) is almost the same as non-Covid patients, save for a little extra cost for personal protective equipment for staff.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to determine the average cost for Covid-19 treatment because it is based on each hospital\u2019s structure and capacity.\n\nBut the price will not be so different between private hospitals. Only the patients will know the cost.\n\n\u201cDifferent hospitals will have different mechanisms. It depends on how many patients they can accommodate in the intensive care unit (ICU) and in normal wards. Not all doctors can treat Covid-19,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve (TMR).\n\nPrivate hospitals have been admitting Covid-19 patients since January after a surge in new cases left the government scrambling for more beds and medical staff in managing the pandemic, particularly for those who can afford treatment.\n\nPrivate hospitals provide beds and expertise based on their respective capacity and capability, with thousands of patients having been treated up until today.\n\nDr Kuljit said all private hospitals are transparent in giving the cost estimation, depending on the level of care needed and the number of hospitalised days, to let the patient decide whether to proceed with treatment.\n\n\u201cHowever, most private hospitals in the Klang Valley are not able to accept any more Covid-19 patients as the wards allocated to treat these cases are full.\n\n\u201cPrivate hospitals are constrained on the number of beds and ICU facilities that can accommodate Covid-19 patients, and the availability of specialists and nurses, which further compounds the restriction,\u201d he added.\n\nA general survey by TMR found the treatment cost per day for a non-critical Covid-19 case at Sunway Medical Centre in Petaling Jaya, Selangor, is between RM1,500 and RM2,500 with a deposit of RM10,000 to RM20,000.\n\n\u201cThe treatment cost for ICU is different depending on the patient\u2019s critical treatment needs. For now, we can only accept 25 Covid-19 patients including in ICU. We have 50 patients on the waiting list,\u201d according to a Sunway Medical Centre spokesperson.\n\nSubang Jaya Medical Centre (SJMC) has also reached full capacity at the moment. However, the hospital does not have a waiting list.\n\nThe cost per day and deposit at SJMC depend on the level of illness, with levels ranging from mild to moderate, followed by serious to critical.\n\n\u201cThe admission rate for mild cases is at RM2,000 per day with a deposit between RM10,000 and RM20,000. For moderate Covid-19 cases, the charge is RM4,000 per day with a RM15,000 deposit. For seriously ill patients, who require treatment at ICU facilities, the charge is between RM6,000 and RM8,000 a day with a deposit of RM30,000.\n\n\u201cFor critical patients, the charge is RM12,000 per day with a RM50,000 deposit,\u201d an SJMC spokesperson said. Other private hospitals declined to comment on their rates when contacted by TMR.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, APHM expressed its hopes that doctors in government hospitals would refer their non-Covid-19 patients to private hospitals for elective surgeries and procedures without further delay.\n\nThis was in response to an updated circular by the Ministry of Health allowing government hospitals to outsource services to private hospitals to treat non-Covid patients, in order to create more treatment space for Covid-19 patients in public hospitals.\n\nPrivate hospitals in this country have the capacity to assist in managing non-Covid-19 patients effectively, allowing public hospitals to focus on treating Covid-19 cases.\n\n\u201cTreatment of non-Covid-19 patients in private hospitals will be funded by the government based on the circular, but patients can only be referred by their treating doctors in the public hospitals to private based on the condition of the ailment,\u201d Dr Kuljit noted in the statement.\n\nHe added that the take up was not satisfactory as only a small number of referrals have been made.\n\nDr Kuljit noted that there were 31 private hospitals in the Klang Valley currently managing Covid-19 patients in normal wards, as well as in the ICU.", "keyword": ["treatment", "icu", "patients", "deposit", "hike", "price", "private", "cost",

could register a surprise narrower decline of 0.6% year-on-year (y-o-y) for first-quarter 2021 (Q1\u201921), compared with a 3.4% y-o-y contraction in Q4\u201920 despite the reimplementation of movement control order 2.0 (MCO 2.0) from Jan 13 to March 4, 2021, according to BIMB Securities Research.\n\n\u201cA robust recovery in manufacturing and external trade activities alongside ongoing policy support are seen as key factors mitigating the impact of stricter containment measures and aiding the recovery last quarter,\u201d it stated in a report.\n\nBank Negara Malaysia will announce the first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) numbers tomorrow.\n\nThe research house said the latest data, which showed industrial production index (IPI) growth of 3.9%, stronger manufacturing growth of 6.8% as well as modest contraction in mining of 4.1% and electricity at 0.1%, confirmed its views of a narrower GDP print for the quarter.\n\nIt said its projection is also supported by a slew of improving figures for Q1\u201921 on a y-o-y basis, from a pickup in export growth of 18.2%, lower contraction of 10.5% in value of construction work done and a smaller services contraction of 3.6%.\n\nThe country saw a 1.5% improvement in volume index of wholesale & retail trade and a 13.7 point improvement in the Malaysian Institute of Economic Research\u2019s (MIER) consumer sentiment index to 98.9 points, the highest reading in tenquarters which pointed to better consumer confidence, among others.\n\nBIMB Securities Research noted that although Malaysia contended with a severe resurgence in Covid-19 cases that peaked in February and tighter restrictions that dampened the revival of domestic consumption, the economy benefited from a relatively strong trade position.\n\n\u201cExports were supported by recovering global demand for manufactured goods and bolstered by a surge in global demand for semiconductors,\u201d it said.\n\nThe research house acknowledged the sizeable gains in exports over the March quarter more than likely offset the softness in domestic consumption as producers benefitted from recovering global demand for manufactured goods, while the net position was bolstered by global demand for semiconductors and recovering commodity prices. However, sectoral discrepancies remain, especially for the persistent underperformers in services and onstruction.\n\nWhile certain industries remained positive or improved from the previous quarter, it noted tourism-related segments \u2013such as accommodation, food & beverage, and transport & storage \u2013 continued to be weighed down by the ongoing containment measures.\n\nConstruction activity, meanwhile, has been affected by shortage of foreign workers and slow commencement of government projects.\n\nBIMB Securities Research stated the economy is expected to track a firmer recovery path from Q2\u201921 onwards due to the base effect and underpinned by sizeable fiscal measures and gradual reopening of the economy.\n\nAlthough it is concerned about the spread of new strains of Covid-19 and alarming rise in the number of infections locally and abroad, the base effect and strong exports could aid this year\u2019s second quarter growth to accelerate depending on the impact of the stimulus spending and a smooth vaccine rollout.\n\nOverall, BIMB Securities Research opined that the 2021 growth outlook has improved for the Malaysia economy, on the back of supportive domestic policies and sound macro fundamentals, but the recovery remains uneven.\n\nIt noted the labour market picture is clearly improving but not quite back to pre-pandemic business-as-usual situation.\n\n\u201cThe latest tightening of measures under MCO 3.0 and lingering uncertainties are expected to weigh on the economy in the near term but not derail the recovery.\u201d\n\nThe research house opined that the impact of MCO 3.0 is expected to be less severe with most key economic sectors allowed to operate and measures in place to mitigate negative effects.\n\n\u201cThe swift and sizeable economic policies as well as easy monetary conditions have been crucial in supporting the economy. These should continue together with sustained vigilance against a resurgence of infections,\u201d it said.\n\nBIMB Securities Research said the balance of risks has tilted to firmer growth, albeit with remaining pockets of weakness. It is maintaining its 2021 GDP growth projection of 5.1% on the back a low base effect and a strong pickup in global demand induced by Covid-19 vaccination efforts, barring an unforeseen risk of an uncontrollable Covid-19 pandemic.", "keyword": ["research", "narrowerthanexpected", "securities", "economy", "growth", "measures", "house", "domestic", "contraction", "q1", "hint", "06", "recovery",

deposits solely due to shifting demands\n\nby NUR HANANI AZMAN / pic by BLOOMBERG\n\nTHERE is no price increase for Covid-19 treatment at private hospitals, particularly in the Klang Valley, although the recent rise in new cases has piled more pressure on the country\u2019s healthcare system.\n\nAssociation of Private Hospitals Malaysia (APHM) president Datuk Dr Kuljit Singh said hospitals do not have the prerogative to raise admission charges and direct deposits solely due to shifting demands.\n\nHe said the cost for Covid-19 patients with pneumonia (an infection that inflames the lungs\u2019 air sacs) is almost the same as non-Covid patients, save for a little extra cost for personal protective equipment for staff.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to determine the average cost for Covid-19 treatment because it is based on each hospital\u2019s structure and capacity.\n\nBut the price will not be so different between private hospitals. Only the patients will know the cost.\n\n\u201cDifferent hospitals will have different mechanisms. It depends on how many patients they can accommodate in the intensive care unit (ICU) and in normal wards. Not all doctors can treat Covid-19,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve (TMR).\n\nPrivate hospitals have been admitting Covid-19 patients since January after a surge in new cases left the government scrambling for more beds and medical staff in managing the pandemic, particularly for those who can afford treatment.\n\nPrivate hospitals provide beds and expertise based on their respective capacity and capability, with thousands of patients having been treated up until today.\n\nDr Kuljit said all private hospitals are transparent in giving the cost estimation, depending on the level of care needed and the number of hospitalised days, to let the patient decide whether to proceed with treatment.\n\n\u201cHowever, most private hospitals in the Klang Valley are not able to accept any more Covid-19 patients as the wards allocated to treat these cases are full.\n\n\u201cPrivate hospitals are constrained on the number of beds and ICU facilities that can accommodate Covid-19 patients, and the availability of specialists and nurses, which further compounds the restriction,\u201d he added.\n\nA general survey by TMR found the treatment cost per day for a non-critical Covid-19 case at Sunway Medical Centre in Petaling Jaya, Selangor, is between RM1,500 and RM2,500 with a deposit of RM10,000 to RM20,000.\n\n\u201cThe treatment cost for ICU is different depending on the patient\u2019s critical treatment needs. For now, we can only accept 25 Covid-19 patients including in ICU. We have 50 patients on the waiting list,\u201d according to a Sunway Medical Centre spokesperson.\n\nSubang Jaya Medical Centre (SJMC) has also reached full capacity at the moment. However, the hospital does not have a waiting list.\n\nThe cost per day and deposit at SJMC depend on the level of illness, with levels ranging from mild to moderate, followed by serious to critical.\n\n\u201cThe admission rate for mild cases is at RM2,000 per day with a deposit between RM10,000 and RM20,000. For moderate Covid-19 cases, the charge is RM4,000 per day with a RM15,000 deposit. For seriously ill patients, who require treatment at ICU facilities, the charge is between RM6,000 and RM8,000 a day with a deposit of RM30,000.\n\n\u201cFor critical patients, the charge is RM12,000 per day with a RM50,000 deposit,\u201d an SJMC spokesperson said. Other private hospitals declined to comment on their rates when contacted by TMR.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, APHM expressed its hopes that doctors in government hospitals would refer their non-Covid-19 patients to private hospitals for elective surgeries and procedures without further delay.\n\nThis was in response to an updated circular by the Ministry of Health allowing government hospitals to outsource services to private hospitals to treat non-Covid patients, in order to create more treatment space for Covid-19 patients in public hospitals.\n\nPrivate hospitals in this country have the capacity to assist in managing non-Covid-19 patients effectively, allowing public hospitals to focus on treating Covid-19 cases.\n\n\u201cTreatment of non-Covid-19 patients in private hospitals will be funded by the government based on the circular, but patients can only be referred by their treating doctors in the public hospitals to private based on the condition of the ailment,\u201d Dr Kuljit noted in the statement.\n\nHe added that the take up was not satisfactory as only a small number of referrals have been made.\n\nDr Kuljit noted that there were 31 private hospitals in the Klang Valley currently managing Covid-19 patients in normal wards, as well as in the ICU.", "keyword": ["treatment", "icu", "patients", "deposit", "hike", "price", "private", "cost",

The militia, armed mainly with hunting rifles, said it had pulled back to spare civilians from being caught in the crossfire.\n\nSeveral residents reached by Reuters said food was in short supply and estimated as many as 5,000 to 8,000 people had fled the town.

could register a surprise narrower decline of 0.6% year-on-year (y-o-y) for first-quarter 2021 (Q1\u201921), compared with a 3.4% y-o-y contraction in Q4\u201920 despite the reimplementation of movement control order 2.0 (MCO 2.0) from Jan 13 to March 4, 2021, according to BIMB Securities Research.\n\n\u201cA robust recovery in manufacturing and external trade activities alongside ongoing policy support are seen as key factors mitigating the impact of stricter containment measures and aiding the recovery last quarter,\u201d it stated in a report.\n\nBank Negara Malaysia will announce the first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) numbers tomorrow.\n\nThe research house said the latest data, which showed industrial production index (IPI) growth of 3.9%, stronger manufacturing growth of 6.8% as well as modest contraction in mining of 4.1% and electricity at 0.1%, confirmed its views of a narrower GDP print for the quarter.\n\nIt said its projection is also supported by a slew of improving figures for Q1\u201921 on a y-o-y basis, from a pickup in export growth of 18.2%, lower contraction of 10.5% in value of construction work done and a smaller services contraction of 3.6%.\n\nThe country saw a 1.5% improvement in volume index of wholesale & retail trade and a 13.7 point improvement in the Malaysian Institute of Economic Research\u2019s (MIER) consumer sentiment index to 98.9 points, the highest reading in tenquarters which pointed to better consumer confidence, among others.\n\nBIMB Securities Research noted that although Malaysia contended with a severe resurgence in Covid-19 cases that peaked in February and tighter restrictions that dampened the revival of domestic consumption, the economy benefited from a relatively strong trade position.\n\n\u201cExports were supported by recovering global demand for manufactured goods and bolstered by a surge in global demand for semiconductors,\u201d it said.\n\nThe research house acknowledged the sizeable gains in exports over the March quarter more than likely offset the softness in domestic consumption as producers benefitted from recovering global demand for manufactured goods, while the net position was bolstered by global demand for semiconductors and recovering commodity prices. However, sectoral discrepancies remain, especially for the persistent underperformers in services and onstruction.\n\nWhile certain industries remained positive or improved from the previous quarter, it noted tourism-related segments \u2013such as accommodation, food & beverage, and transport & storage \u2013 continued to be weighed down by the ongoing containment measures.\n\nConstruction activity, meanwhile, has been affected by shortage of foreign workers and slow commencement of government projects.\n\nBIMB Securities Research stated the economy is expected to track a firmer recovery path from Q2\u201921 onwards due to the base effect and underpinned by sizeable fiscal measures and gradual reopening of the economy.\n\nAlthough it is concerned about the spread of new strains of Covid-19 and alarming rise in the number of infections locally and abroad, the base effect and strong exports could aid this year\u2019s second quarter growth to accelerate depending on the impact of the stimulus spending and a smooth vaccine rollout.\n\nOverall, BIMB Securities Research opined that the 2021 growth outlook has improved for the Malaysia economy, on the back of supportive domestic policies and sound macro fundamentals, but the recovery remains uneven.\n\nIt noted the labour market picture is clearly improving but not quite back to pre-pandemic business-as-usual situation.\n\n\u201cThe latest tightening of measures under MCO 3.0 and lingering uncertainties are expected to weigh on the economy in the near term but not derail the recovery.\u201d\n\nThe research house opined that the impact of MCO 3.0 is expected to be less severe with most key economic sectors allowed to operate and measures in place to mitigate negative effects.\n\n\u201cThe swift and sizeable economic policies as well as easy monetary conditions have been crucial in supporting the economy. These should continue together with sustained vigilance against a resurgence of infections,\u201d it said.\n\nBIMB Securities Research said the balance of risks has tilted to firmer growth, albeit with remaining pockets of weakness. It is maintaining its 2021 GDP growth projection of 5.1% on the back a low base effect and a strong pickup in global demand induced by Covid-19 vaccination efforts, barring an unforeseen risk of an

deposits solely due to shifting demands\n\nby NUR HANANI AZMAN / pic by BLOOMBERG\n\nTHERE is no price increase for Covid-19 treatment at private hospitals, particularly in the Klang Valley, although the recent rise in new cases has piled more pressure on the country\u2019s healthcare system.\n\nAssociation of Private Hospitals Malaysia (APHM) president Datuk Dr Kuljit Singh said hospitals do not have the prerogative to raise admission charges and direct deposits solely due to shifting demands.\n\nHe said the cost for Covid-19 patients with pneumonia (an infection that inflames the lungs\u2019 air sacs) is almost the same as non-Covid patients, save for a little extra cost for personal protective equipment for staff.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to determine the average cost for Covid-19 treatment because it is based on each hospital\u2019s structure and capacity.\n\nBut the price will not be so different between private hospitals. Only the patients will know the cost.\n\n\u201cDifferent hospitals will have different mechanisms. It depends on how many patients they can accommodate in the intensive care unit (ICU) and in normal wards. Not all doctors can treat Covid-19,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve (TMR).\n\nPrivate hospitals have been admitting Covid-19 patients since January after a surge in new cases left the government scrambling for more beds and medical staff in managing the pandemic, particularly for those who can afford treatment.\n\nPrivate hospitals provide beds and expertise based on their respective capacity and capability, with thousands of patients having been treated up until today.\n\nDr Kuljit said all private hospitals are transparent in giving the cost estimation, depending on the level of care needed and the number of hospitalised days, to let the patient decide whether to proceed with treatment.\n\n\u201cHowever, most private hospitals in the Klang Valley are not able to accept any more Covid-19 patients as the wards allocated to treat these cases are full.\n\n\u201cPrivate hospitals are constrained on the number of beds and ICU facilities that can accommodate Covid-19 patients, and the availability of specialists and nurses, which further compounds the restriction,\u201d he added.\n\nA general survey by TMR found the treatment cost per day for a non-critical Covid-19 case at Sunway Medical Centre in Petaling Jaya, Selangor, is between RM1,500 and RM2,500 with a deposit of RM10,000 to RM20,000.\n\n\u201cThe treatment cost for ICU is different depending on the patient\u2019s critical treatment needs. For now, we can only accept 25 Covid-19 patients including in ICU. We have 50 patients on the waiting list,\u201d according to a Sunway Medical Centre spokesperson.\n\nSubang Jaya Medical Centre (SJMC) has also reached full capacity at the moment. However, the hospital does not have a waiting list.\n\nThe cost per day and deposit at SJMC depend on the level of illness, with levels ranging from mild to moderate, followed by serious to critical.\n\n\u201cThe admission rate for mild cases is at RM2,000 per day with a deposit between RM10,000 and RM20,000. For moderate Covid-19 cases, the charge is RM4,000 per day with a RM15,000 deposit. For seriously ill patients, who require treatment at ICU facilities, the charge is between RM6,000 and RM8,000 a day with a deposit of RM30,000.\n\n\u201cFor critical patients, the charge is RM12,000 per day with a RM50,000 deposit,\u201d an SJMC spokesperson said. Other private hospitals declined to comment on their rates when contacted by TMR.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, APHM expressed its hopes that doctors in government hospitals would refer their non-Covid-19 patients to private hospitals for elective surgeries and procedures without further delay.\n\nThis was in response to an updated circular by the Ministry of Health allowing government hospitals to outsource services to private hospitals to treat non-Covid patients, in order to create more treatment space for Covid-19 patients in public hospitals.\n\nPrivate hospitals in this country have the capacity to assist in managing non-Covid-19 patients effectively, allowing public hospitals to focus on treating Covid-19 cases.\n\n\u201cTreatment of non-Covid-19 patients in private hospitals will be funded by the government based on the circular, but patients can only be referred by their treating doctors in the public hospitals to private based on the condition of the ailment,\u201d Dr Kuljit noted in the statement.\n\nHe added that the take up was not satisfactory as only a small number of referrals have been made.\n\nDr Kuljit noted that there were 31 private hospitals in the Klang Valley currently managing Covid-19 patients in normal wards, as well as in the ICU.", "keyword": ["treatment", "icu", "patients", "deposit", "hike", "price", "private", "cost",

could register a surprise narrower decline of 0.6% year-on-year (y-o-y) for first-quarter 2021 (Q1\u201921), compared with a 3.4% y-o-y contraction in Q4\u201920 despite the reimplementation of movement control order 2.0 (MCO 2.0) from Jan 13 to March 4, 2021, according to BIMB Securities Research.\n\n\u201cA robust recovery in manufacturing and external trade activities alongside ongoing policy support are seen as key factors mitigating the impact of stricter containment measures and aiding the recovery last quarter,\u201d it stated in a report.\n\nBank Negara Malaysia will announce the first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) numbers tomorrow.\n\nThe research house said the latest data, which showed industrial production index (IPI) growth of 3.9%, stronger manufacturing growth of 6.8% as well as modest contraction in mining of 4.1% and electricity at 0.1%, confirmed its views of a narrower GDP print for the quarter.\n\nIt said its projection is also supported by a slew of improving figures for Q1\u201921 on a y-o-y basis, from a pickup in export growth of 18.2%, lower contraction of 10.5% in value of construction work done and a smaller services contraction of 3.6%.\n\nThe country saw a 1.5% improvement in volume index of wholesale & retail trade and a 13.7 point improvement in the Malaysian Institute of Economic Research\u2019s (MIER) consumer sentiment index to 98.9 points, the highest reading in tenquarters which pointed to better consumer confidence, among others.\n\nBIMB Securities Research noted that although Malaysia contended with a severe resurgence in Covid-19 cases that peaked in February and tighter restrictions that dampened the revival of domestic consumption, the economy benefited from a relatively strong trade position.\n\n\u201cExports were supported by recovering global demand for manufactured goods and bolstered by a surge in global demand for semiconductors,\u201d it said.\n\nThe research house acknowledged the sizeable gains in exports over the March quarter more than likely offset the softness in domestic consumption as producers benefitted from recovering global demand for manufactured goods, while the net position was bolstered by global demand for semiconductors and recovering commodity prices. However, sectoral discrepancies remain, especially for the persistent underperformers in services and onstruction.\n\nWhile certain industries remained positive or improved from the previous quarter, it noted tourism-related segments \u2013such as accommodation, food & beverage, and transport & storage \u2013 continued to be weighed down by the ongoing containment measures.\n\nConstruction activity, meanwhile, has been affected by shortage of foreign workers and slow commencement of government projects.\n\nBIMB Securities Research stated the economy is expected to track a firmer recovery path from Q2\u201921 onwards due to the base effect and underpinned by sizeable fiscal measures and gradual reopening of the economy.\n\nAlthough it is concerned about the spread of new strains of Covid-19 and alarming rise in the number of infections locally and abroad, the base effect and strong exports could aid this year\u2019s second quarter growth to accelerate depending on the impact of the stimulus spending and a smooth vaccine rollout.\n\nOverall, BIMB Securities Research opined that the 2021 growth outlook has improved for the Malaysia economy, on the back of supportive domestic policies and sound macro fundamentals, but the recovery remains uneven.\n\nIt noted the labour market picture is clearly improving but not quite back to pre-pandemic business-as-usual situation.\n\n\u201cThe latest tightening of measures under MCO 3.0 and lingering uncertainties are expected to weigh on the economy in the near term but not derail the recovery.\u201d\n\nThe research house opined that the impact of MCO 3.0 is expected to be less severe with most key economic sectors allowed to operate and measures in place to mitigate negative effects.\n\n\u201cThe swift and sizeable economic policies as well as easy monetary conditions have been crucial in supporting the economy. These should continue together with sustained vigilance against a resurgence of infections,\u201d it said.\n\nBIMB Securities Research said the balance of risks has tilted to firmer growth, albeit with remaining pockets of weakness. It is maintaining its 2021 GDP growth projection of 5.1% on the back a low base effect and a strong pickup in global demand induced by Covid-19 vaccination efforts, barring an unforeseen risk of an uncontrollable Covid-19 pandemic.", "keyword": ["research", "narrowerthanexpected", "securities", "economy", "growth", "measures", "house", "domestic", "contraction", "q1", "hint", "06", "recovery",

deposits solely due to shifting demands\n\nby NUR HANANI AZMAN / pic by BLOOMBERG\n\nTHERE is no price increase for Covid-19 treatment at private hospitals, particularly in the Klang Valley, although the recent rise in new cases has piled more pressure on the country\u2019s healthcare system.\n\nAssociation of Private Hospitals Malaysia (APHM) president Datuk Dr Kuljit Singh said hospitals do not have the prerogative to raise admission charges and direct deposits solely due to shifting demands.\n\nHe said the cost for Covid-19 patients with pneumonia (an infection that inflames the lungs\u2019 air sacs) is almost the same as non-Covid patients, save for a little extra cost for personal protective equipment for staff.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to determine the average cost for Covid-19 treatment because it is based on each hospital\u2019s structure and capacity.\n\nBut the price will not be so different between private hospitals. Only the patients will know the cost.\n\n\u201cDifferent hospitals will have different mechanisms. It depends on how many patients they can accommodate in the intensive care unit (ICU) and in normal wards. Not all doctors can treat Covid-19,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve (TMR).\n\nPrivate hospitals have been admitting Covid-19 patients since January after a surge in new cases left the government scrambling for more beds and medical staff in managing the pandemic, particularly for those who can afford treatment.\n\nPrivate hospitals provide beds and expertise based on their respective capacity and capability, with thousands of patients having been treated up until today.\n\nDr Kuljit said all private hospitals are transparent in giving the cost estimation, depending on the level of care needed and the number of hospitalised days, to let the patient decide whether to proceed with treatment.\n\n\u201cHowever, most private hospitals in the Klang Valley are not able to accept any more Covid-19 patients as the wards allocated to treat these cases are full.\n\n\u201cPrivate hospitals are constrained on the number of beds and ICU facilities that can accommodate Covid-19 patients, and the availability of specialists and nurses, which further compounds the restriction,\u201d he added.\n\nA general survey by TMR found the treatment cost per day for a non-critical Covid-19 case at Sunway Medical Centre in Petaling Jaya, Selangor, is between RM1,500 and RM2,500 with a deposit of RM10,000 to RM20,000.\n\n\u201cThe treatment cost for ICU is different depending on the patient\u2019s critical treatment needs. For now, we can only accept 25 Covid-19 patients including in ICU. We have 50 patients on the waiting list,\u201d according to a Sunway Medical Centre spokesperson.\n\nSubang Jaya Medical Centre (SJMC) has also reached full capacity at the moment. However, the hospital does not have a waiting list.\n\nThe cost per day and deposit at SJMC depend on the level of illness, with levels ranging from mild to moderate, followed by serious to critical.\n\n\u201cThe admission rate for mild cases is at RM2,000 per day with a deposit between RM10,000 and RM20,000. For moderate Covid-19 cases, the charge is RM4,000 per day with a RM15,000 deposit. For seriously ill patients, who require treatment at ICU facilities, the charge is between RM6,000 and RM8,000 a day with a deposit of RM30,000.\n\n\u201cFor critical patients, the charge is RM12,000 per day with a RM50,000 deposit,\u201d an SJMC spokesperson said. Other private hospitals declined to comment on their rates when contacted by TMR.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, APHM expressed its hopes that doctors in government hospitals would refer their non-Covid-19 patients to private hospitals for elective surgeries and procedures without further delay.\n\nThis was in response to an updated circular by the Ministry of Health allowing government hospitals to outsource services to private hospitals to treat non-Covid patients, in order to create more treatment space for Covid-19 patients in public hospitals.\n\nPrivate hospitals in this country have the capacity to assist in managing non-Covid-19 patients effectively, allowing public hospitals to focus on treating Covid-19 cases.\n\n\u201cTreatment of non-Covid-19 patients in private hospitals will be funded by the government based on the circular, but patients can only be referred by their treating doctors in the public hospitals to private based on the condition of the ailment,\u201d Dr Kuljit noted in the statement.\n\nHe added that the take up was not satisfactory as only a small number of referrals have been made.\n\nDr Kuljit noted that there were 31 private hospitals in the Klang Valley currently managing Covid-19 patients in normal wards, as well as in the ICU.", "keyword": ["treatment", "icu", "patients", "deposit", "hike", "price", "private", "cost",

The militia, armed mainly with hunting rifles, said it had pulled back to spare civilians from being caught in the crossfire.\n\nSeveral residents reached by Reuters said food was in short supply and estimated as many as 5,000 to 8,000 people had fled the town.

could register a surprise narrower decline of 0.6% year-on-year (y-o-y) for first-quarter 2021 (Q1\u201921), compared with a 3.4% y-o-y contraction in Q4\u201920 despite the reimplementation of movement control order 2.0 (MCO 2.0) from Jan 13 to March 4, 2021, according to BIMB Securities Research.\n\n\u201cA robust recovery in manufacturing and external trade activities alongside ongoing policy support are seen as key factors mitigating the impact of stricter containment measures and aiding the recovery last quarter,\u201d it stated in a report.\n\nBank Negara Malaysia will announce the first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) numbers tomorrow.\n\nThe research house said the latest data, which showed industrial production index (IPI) growth of 3.9%, stronger manufacturing growth of 6.8% as well as modest contraction in mining of 4.1% and electricity at 0.1%, confirmed its views of a narrower GDP print for the quarter.\n\nIt said its projection is also supported by a slew of improving figures for Q1\u201921 on a y-o-y basis, from a pickup in export growth of 18.2%, lower contraction of 10.5% in value of construction work done and a smaller services contraction of 3.6%.\n\nThe country saw a 1.5% improvement in volume index of wholesale & retail trade and a 13.7 point improvement in the Malaysian Institute of Economic Research\u2019s (MIER) consumer sentiment index to 98.9 points, the highest reading in tenquarters which pointed to better consumer confidence, among others.\n\nBIMB Securities Research noted that although Malaysia contended with a severe resurgence in Covid-19 cases that peaked in February and tighter restrictions that dampened the revival of domestic consumption, the economy benefited from a relatively strong trade position.\n\n\u201cExports were supported by recovering global demand for manufactured goods and bolstered by a surge in global demand for semiconductors,\u201d it said.\n\nThe research house acknowledged the sizeable gains in exports over the March quarter more than likely offset the softness in domestic consumption as producers benefitted from recovering global demand for manufactured goods, while the net position was bolstered by global demand for semiconductors and recovering commodity prices. However, sectoral discrepancies remain, especially for the persistent underperformers in services and onstruction.\n\nWhile certain industries remained positive or improved from the previous quarter, it noted tourism-related segments \u2013such as accommodation, food & beverage, and transport & storage \u2013 continued to be weighed down by the ongoing containment measures.\n\nConstruction activity, meanwhile, has been affected by shortage of foreign workers and slow commencement of government projects.\n\nBIMB Securities Research stated the economy is expected to track a firmer recovery path from Q2\u201921 onwards due to the base effect and underpinned by sizeable fiscal measures and gradual reopening of the economy.\n\nAlthough it is concerned about the spread of new strains of Covid-19 and alarming rise in the number of infections locally and abroad, the base effect and strong exports could aid this year\u2019s second quarter growth to accelerate depending on the impact of the stimulus spending and a smooth vaccine rollout.\n\nOverall, BIMB Securities Research opined that the 2021 growth outlook has improved for the Malaysia economy, on the back of supportive domestic policies and sound macro fundamentals, but the recovery remains uneven.\n\nIt noted the labour market picture is clearly improving but not quite back to pre-pandemic business-as-usual situation.\n\n\u201cThe latest tightening of measures under MCO 3.0 and lingering uncertainties are expected to weigh on the economy in the near term but not derail the recovery.\u201d\n\nThe research house opined that the impact of MCO 3.0 is expected to be less severe with most key economic sectors allowed to operate and measures in place to mitigate negative effects.\n\n\u201cThe swift and sizeable economic policies as well as easy monetary conditions have been crucial in supporting the economy. These should continue together with sustained vigilance against a resurgence of infections,\u201d it said.\n\nBIMB Securities Research said the balance of risks has tilted to firmer growth, albeit with remaining pockets of weakness. It is maintaining its 2021 GDP growth projection of 5.1% on the back a low base effect and a strong pickup in global demand induced by Covid-19 vaccination efforts, barring an unforeseen risk of an

deposits solely due to shifting demands\n\nby NUR HANANI AZMAN / pic by BLOOMBERG\n\nTHERE is no price increase for Covid-19 treatment at private hospitals, particularly in the Klang Valley, although the recent rise in new cases has piled more pressure on the country\u2019s healthcare system.\n\nAssociation of Private Hospitals Malaysia (APHM) president Datuk Dr Kuljit Singh said hospitals do not have the prerogative to raise admission charges and direct deposits solely due to shifting demands.\n\nHe said the cost for Covid-19 patients with pneumonia (an infection that inflames the lungs\u2019 air sacs) is almost the same as non-Covid patients, save for a little extra cost for personal protective equipment for staff.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to determine the average cost for Covid-19 treatment because it is based on each hospital\u2019s structure and capacity.\n\nBut the price will not be so different between private hospitals. Only the patients will know the cost.\n\n\u201cDifferent hospitals will have different mechanisms. It depends on how many patients they can accommodate in the intensive care unit (ICU) and in normal wards. Not all doctors can treat Covid-19,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve (TMR).\n\nPrivate hospitals have been admitting Covid-19 patients since January after a surge in new cases left the government scrambling for more beds and medical staff in managing the pandemic, particularly for those who can afford treatment.\n\nPrivate hospitals provide beds and expertise based on their respective capacity and capability, with thousands of patients having been treated up until today.\n\nDr Kuljit said all private hospitals are transparent in giving the cost estimation, depending on the level of care needed and the number of hospitalised days, to let the patient decide whether to proceed with treatment.\n\n\u201cHowever, most private hospitals in the Klang Valley are not able to accept any more Covid-19 patients as the wards allocated to treat these cases are full.\n\n\u201cPrivate hospitals are constrained on the number of beds and ICU facilities that can accommodate Covid-19 patients, and the availability of specialists and nurses, which further compounds the restriction,\u201d he added.\n\nA general survey by TMR found the treatment cost per day for a non-critical Covid-19 case at Sunway Medical Centre in Petaling Jaya, Selangor, is between RM1,500 and RM2,500 with a deposit of RM10,000 to RM20,000.\n\n\u201cThe treatment cost for ICU is different depending on the patient\u2019s critical treatment needs. For now, we can only accept 25 Covid-19 patients including in ICU. We have 50 patients on the waiting list,\u201d according to a Sunway Medical Centre spokesperson.\n\nSubang Jaya Medical Centre (SJMC) has also reached full capacity at the moment. However, the hospital does not have a waiting list.\n\nThe cost per day and deposit at SJMC depend on the level of illness, with levels ranging from mild to moderate, followed by serious to critical.\n\n\u201cThe admission rate for mild cases is at RM2,000 per day with a deposit between RM10,000 and RM20,000. For moderate Covid-19 cases, the charge is RM4,000 per day with a RM15,000 deposit. For seriously ill patients, who require treatment at ICU facilities, the charge is between RM6,000 and RM8,000 a day with a deposit of RM30,000.\n\n\u201cFor critical patients, the charge is RM12,000 per day with a RM50,000 deposit,\u201d an SJMC spokesperson said. Other private hospitals declined to comment on their rates when contacted by TMR.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, APHM expressed its hopes that doctors in government hospitals would refer their non-Covid-19 patients to private hospitals for elective surgeries and procedures without further delay.\n\nThis was in response to an updated circular by the Ministry of Health allowing government hospitals to outsource services to private hospitals to treat non-Covid patients, in order to create more treatment space for Covid-19 patients in public hospitals.\n\nPrivate hospitals in this country have the capacity to assist in managing non-Covid-19 patients effectively, allowing public hospitals to focus on treating Covid-19 cases.\n\n\u201cTreatment of non-Covid-19 patients in private hospitals will be funded by the government based on the circular, but patients can only be referred by their treating doctors in the public hospitals to private based on the condition of the ailment,\u201d Dr Kuljit noted in the statement.\n\nHe added that the take up was not satisfactory as only a small number of referrals have been made.\n\nDr Kuljit noted that there were 31 private hospitals in the Klang Valley currently managing Covid-19 patients in normal wards, as well as in the ICU.", "keyword": ["treatment", "icu", "patients", "deposit", "hike", "price", "private", "cost",

could register a surprise narrower decline of 0.6% year-on-year (y-o-y) for first-quarter 2021 (Q1\u201921), compared with a 3.4% y-o-y contraction in Q4\u201920 despite the reimplementation of movement control order 2.0 (MCO 2.0) from Jan 13 to March 4, 2021, according to BIMB Securities Research.\n\n\u201cA robust recovery in manufacturing and external trade activities alongside ongoing policy support are seen as key factors mitigating the impact of stricter containment measures and aiding the recovery last quarter,\u201d it stated in a report.\n\nBank Negara Malaysia will announce the first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) numbers tomorrow.\n\nThe research house said the latest data, which showed industrial production index (IPI) growth of 3.9%, stronger manufacturing growth of 6.8% as well as modest contraction in mining of 4.1% and electricity at 0.1%, confirmed its views of a narrower GDP print for the quarter.\n\nIt said its projection is also supported by a slew of improving figures for Q1\u201921 on a y-o-y basis, from a pickup in export growth of 18.2%, lower contraction of 10.5% in value of construction work done and a smaller services contraction of 3.6%.\n\nThe country saw a 1.5% improvement in volume index of wholesale & retail trade and a 13.7 point improvement in the Malaysian Institute of Economic Research\u2019s (MIER) consumer sentiment index to 98.9 points, the highest reading in tenquarters which pointed to better consumer confidence, among others.\n\nBIMB Securities Research noted that although Malaysia contended with a severe resurgence in Covid-19 cases that peaked in February and tighter restrictions that dampened the revival of domestic consumption, the economy benefited from a relatively strong trade position.\n\n\u201cExports were supported by recovering global demand for manufactured goods and bolstered by a surge in global demand for semiconductors,\u201d it said.\n\nThe research house acknowledged the sizeable gains in exports over the March quarter more than likely offset the softness in domestic consumption as producers benefitted from recovering global demand for manufactured goods, while the net position was bolstered by global demand for semiconductors and recovering commodity prices. However, sectoral discrepancies remain, especially for the persistent underperformers in services and onstruction.\n\nWhile certain industries remained positive or improved from the previous quarter, it noted tourism-related segments \u2013such as accommodation, food & beverage, and transport & storage \u2013 continued to be weighed down by the ongoing containment measures.\n\nConstruction activity, meanwhile, has been affected by shortage of foreign workers and slow commencement of government projects.\n\nBIMB Securities Research stated the economy is expected to track a firmer recovery path from Q2\u201921 onwards due to the base effect and underpinned by sizeable fiscal measures and gradual reopening of the economy.\n\nAlthough it is concerned about the spread of new strains of Covid-19 and alarming rise in the number of infections locally and abroad, the base effect and strong exports could aid this year\u2019s second quarter growth to accelerate depending on the impact of the stimulus spending and a smooth vaccine rollout.\n\nOverall, BIMB Securities Research opined that the 2021 growth outlook has improved for the Malaysia economy, on the back of supportive domestic policies and sound macro fundamentals, but the recovery remains uneven.\n\nIt noted the labour market picture is clearly improving but not quite back to pre-pandemic business-as-usual situation.\n\n\u201cThe latest tightening of measures under MCO 3.0 and lingering uncertainties are expected to weigh on the economy in the near term but not derail the recovery.\u201d\n\nThe research house opined that the impact of MCO 3.0 is expected to be less severe with most key economic sectors allowed to operate and measures in place to mitigate negative effects.\n\n\u201cThe swift and sizeable economic policies as well as easy monetary conditions have been crucial in supporting the economy. These should continue together with sustained vigilance against a resurgence of infections,\u201d it said.\n\nBIMB Securities Research said the balance of risks has tilted to firmer growth, albeit with remaining pockets of weakness. It is maintaining its 2021 GDP growth projection of 5.1% on the back a low base effect and a strong pickup in global demand induced by Covid-19 vaccination efforts, barring an unforeseen risk of an uncontrollable Covid-19 pandemic.", "keyword": ["research", "narrowerthanexpected", "securities", "economy", "growth", "measures", "house", "domestic", "contraction", "q1", "hint", "06", "recovery",

deposits solely due to shifting demands\n\nby NUR HANANI AZMAN / pic by BLOOMBERG\n\nTHERE is no price increase for Covid-19 treatment at private hospitals, particularly in the Klang Valley, although the recent rise in new cases has piled more pressure on the country\u2019s healthcare system.\n\nAssociation of Private Hospitals Malaysia (APHM) president Datuk Dr Kuljit Singh said hospitals do not have the prerogative to raise admission charges and direct deposits solely due to shifting demands.\n\nHe said the cost for Covid-19 patients with pneumonia (an infection that inflames the lungs\u2019 air sacs) is almost the same as non-Covid patients, save for a little extra cost for personal protective equipment for staff.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to determine the average cost for Covid-19 treatment because it is based on each hospital\u2019s structure and capacity.\n\nBut the price will not be so different between private hospitals. Only the patients will know the cost.\n\n\u201cDifferent hospitals will have different mechanisms. It depends on how many patients they can accommodate in the intensive care unit (ICU) and in normal wards. Not all doctors can treat Covid-19,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve (TMR).\n\nPrivate hospitals have been admitting Covid-19 patients since January after a surge in new cases left the government scrambling for more beds and medical staff in managing the pandemic, particularly for those who can afford treatment.\n\nPrivate hospitals provide beds and expertise based on their respective capacity and capability, with thousands of patients having been treated up until today.\n\nDr Kuljit said all private hospitals are transparent in giving the cost estimation, depending on the level of care needed and the number of hospitalised days, to let the patient decide whether to proceed with treatment.\n\n\u201cHowever, most private hospitals in the Klang Valley are not able to accept any more Covid-19 patients as the wards allocated to treat these cases are full.\n\n\u201cPrivate hospitals are constrained on the number of beds and ICU facilities that can accommodate Covid-19 patients, and the availability of specialists and nurses, which further compounds the restriction,\u201d he added.\n\nA general survey by TMR found the treatment cost per day for a non-critical Covid-19 case at Sunway Medical Centre in Petaling Jaya, Selangor, is between RM1,500 and RM2,500 with a deposit of RM10,000 to RM20,000.\n\n\u201cThe treatment cost for ICU is different depending on the patient\u2019s critical treatment needs. For now, we can only accept 25 Covid-19 patients including in ICU. We have 50 patients on the waiting list,\u201d according to a Sunway Medical Centre spokesperson.\n\nSubang Jaya Medical Centre (SJMC) has also reached full capacity at the moment. However, the hospital does not have a waiting list.\n\nThe cost per day and deposit at SJMC depend on the level of illness, with levels ranging from mild to moderate, followed by serious to critical.\n\n\u201cThe admission rate for mild cases is at RM2,000 per day with a deposit between RM10,000 and RM20,000. For moderate Covid-19 cases, the charge is RM4,000 per day with a RM15,000 deposit. For seriously ill patients, who require treatment at ICU facilities, the charge is between RM6,000 and RM8,000 a day with a deposit of RM30,000.\n\n\u201cFor critical patients, the charge is RM12,000 per day with a RM50,000 deposit,\u201d an SJMC spokesperson said. Other private hospitals declined to comment on their rates when contacted by TMR.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, APHM expressed its hopes that doctors in government hospitals would refer their non-Covid-19 patients to private hospitals for elective surgeries and procedures without further delay.\n\nThis was in response to an updated circular by the Ministry of Health allowing government hospitals to outsource services to private hospitals to treat non-Covid patients, in order to create more treatment space for Covid-19 patients in public hospitals.\n\nPrivate hospitals in this country have the capacity to assist in managing non-Covid-19 patients effectively, allowing public hospitals to focus on treating Covid-19 cases.\n\n\u201cTreatment of non-Covid-19 patients in private hospitals will be funded by the government based on the circular, but patients can only be referred by their treating doctors in the public hospitals to private based on the condition of the ailment,\u201d Dr Kuljit noted in the statement.\n\nHe added that the take up was not satisfactory as only a small number of referrals have been made.\n\nDr Kuljit noted that there were 31 private hospitals in the Klang Valley currently managing Covid-19 patients in normal wards, as well as in the ICU.", "keyword": ["treatment", "icu", "patients", "deposit", "hike", "price", "private", "cost",

The militia, armed mainly with hunting rifles, said it had pulled back to spare civilians from being caught in the crossfire.\n\nSeveral residents reached by Reuters said food was in short supply and estimated as many as 5,000 to 8,000 people had fled the town.

could register a surprise narrower decline of 0.6% year-on-year (y-o-y) for first-quarter 2021 (Q1\u201921), compared with a 3.4% y-o-y contraction in Q4\u201920 despite the reimplementation of movement control order 2.0 (MCO 2.0) from Jan 13 to March 4, 2021, according to BIMB Securities Research.\n\n\u201cA robust recovery in manufacturing and external trade activities alongside ongoing policy support are seen as key factors mitigating the impact of stricter containment measures and aiding the recovery last quarter,\u201d it stated in a report.\n\nBank Negara Malaysia will announce the first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) numbers tomorrow.\n\nThe research house said the latest data, which showed industrial production index (IPI) growth of 3.9%, stronger manufacturing growth of 6.8% as well as modest contraction in mining of 4.1% and electricity at 0.1%, confirmed its views of a narrower GDP print for the quarter.\n\nIt said its projection is also supported by a slew of improving figures for Q1\u201921 on a y-o-y basis, from a pickup in export growth of 18.2%, lower contraction of 10.5% in value of construction work done and a smaller services contraction of 3.6%.\n\nThe country saw a 1.5% improvement in volume index of wholesale & retail trade and a 13.7 point improvement in the Malaysian Institute of Economic Research\u2019s (MIER) consumer sentiment index to 98.9 points, the highest reading in tenquarters which pointed to better consumer confidence, among others.\n\nBIMB Securities Research noted that although Malaysia contended with a severe resurgence in Covid-19 cases that peaked in February and tighter restrictions that dampened the revival of domestic consumption, the economy benefited from a relatively strong trade position.\n\n\u201cExports were supported by recovering global demand for manufactured goods and bolstered by a surge in global demand for semiconductors,\u201d it said.\n\nThe research house acknowledged the sizeable gains in exports over the March quarter more than likely offset the softness in domestic consumption as producers benefitted from recovering global demand for manufactured goods, while the net position was bolstered by global demand for semiconductors and recovering commodity prices. However, sectoral discrepancies remain, especially for the persistent underperformers in services and onstruction.\n\nWhile certain industries remained positive or improved from the previous quarter, it noted tourism-related segments \u2013such as accommodation, food & beverage, and transport & storage \u2013 continued to be weighed down by the ongoing containment measures.\n\nConstruction activity, meanwhile, has been affected by shortage of foreign workers and slow commencement of government projects.\n\nBIMB Securities Research stated the economy is expected to track a firmer recovery path from Q2\u201921 onwards due to the base effect and underpinned by sizeable fiscal measures and gradual reopening of the economy.\n\nAlthough it is concerned about the spread of new strains of Covid-19 and alarming rise in the number of infections locally and abroad, the base effect and strong exports could aid this year\u2019s second quarter growth to accelerate depending on the impact of the stimulus spending and a smooth vaccine rollout.\n\nOverall, BIMB Securities Research opined that the 2021 growth outlook has improved for the Malaysia economy, on the back of supportive domestic policies and sound macro fundamentals, but the recovery remains uneven.\n\nIt noted the labour market picture is clearly improving but not quite back to pre-pandemic business-as-usual situation.\n\n\u201cThe latest tightening of measures under MCO 3.0 and lingering uncertainties are expected to weigh on the economy in the near term but not derail the recovery.\u201d\n\nThe research house opined that the impact of MCO 3.0 is expected to be less severe with most key economic sectors allowed to operate and measures in place to mitigate negative effects.\n\n\u201cThe swift and sizeable economic policies as well as easy monetary conditions have been crucial in supporting the economy. These should continue together with sustained vigilance against a resurgence of infections,\u201d it said.\n\nBIMB Securities Research said the balance of risks has tilted to firmer growth, albeit with remaining pockets of weakness. It is maintaining its 2021 GDP growth projection of 5.1% on the back a low base effect and a strong pickup in global demand induced by Covid-19 vaccination efforts, barring an unforeseen risk of an

deposits solely due to shifting demands\n\nby NUR HANANI AZMAN / pic by BLOOMBERG\n\nTHERE is no price increase for Covid-19 treatment at private hospitals, particularly in the Klang Valley, although the recent rise in new cases has piled more pressure on the country\u2019s healthcare system.\n\nAssociation of Private Hospitals Malaysia (APHM) president Datuk Dr Kuljit Singh said hospitals do not have the prerogative to raise admission charges and direct deposits solely due to shifting demands.\n\nHe said the cost for Covid-19 patients with pneumonia (an infection that inflames the lungs\u2019 air sacs) is almost the same as non-Covid patients, save for a little extra cost for personal protective equipment for staff.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to determine the average cost for Covid-19 treatment because it is based on each hospital\u2019s structure and capacity.\n\nBut the price will not be so different between private hospitals. Only the patients will know the cost.\n\n\u201cDifferent hospitals will have different mechanisms. It depends on how many patients they can accommodate in the intensive care unit (ICU) and in normal wards. Not all doctors can treat Covid-19,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve (TMR).\n\nPrivate hospitals have been admitting Covid-19 patients since January after a surge in new cases left the government scrambling for more beds and medical staff in managing the pandemic, particularly for those who can afford treatment.\n\nPrivate hospitals provide beds and expertise based on their respective capacity and capability, with thousands of patients having been treated up until today.\n\nDr Kuljit said all private hospitals are transparent in giving the cost estimation, depending on the level of care needed and the number of hospitalised days, to let the patient decide whether to proceed with treatment.\n\n\u201cHowever, most private hospitals in the Klang Valley are not able to accept any more Covid-19 patients as the wards allocated to treat these cases are full.\n\n\u201cPrivate hospitals are constrained on the number of beds and ICU facilities that can accommodate Covid-19 patients, and the availability of specialists and nurses, which further compounds the restriction,\u201d he added.\n\nA general survey by TMR found the treatment cost per day for a non-critical Covid-19 case at Sunway Medical Centre in Petaling Jaya, Selangor, is between RM1,500 and RM2,500 with a deposit of RM10,000 to RM20,000.\n\n\u201cThe treatment cost for ICU is different depending on the patient\u2019s critical treatment needs. For now, we can only accept 25 Covid-19 patients including in ICU. We have 50 patients on the waiting list,\u201d according to a Sunway Medical Centre spokesperson.\n\nSubang Jaya Medical Centre (SJMC) has also reached full capacity at the moment. However, the hospital does not have a waiting list.\n\nThe cost per day and deposit at SJMC depend on the level of illness, with levels ranging from mild to moderate, followed by serious to critical.\n\n\u201cThe admission rate for mild cases is at RM2,000 per day with a deposit between RM10,000 and RM20,000. For moderate Covid-19 cases, the charge is RM4,000 per day with a RM15,000 deposit. For seriously ill patients, who require treatment at ICU facilities, the charge is between RM6,000 and RM8,000 a day with a deposit of RM30,000.\n\n\u201cFor critical patients, the charge is RM12,000 per day with a RM50,000 deposit,\u201d an SJMC spokesperson said. Other private hospitals declined to comment on their rates when contacted by TMR.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, APHM expressed its hopes that doctors in government hospitals would refer their non-Covid-19 patients to private hospitals for elective surgeries and procedures without further delay.\n\nThis was in response to an updated circular by the Ministry of Health allowing government hospitals to outsource services to private hospitals to treat non-Covid patients, in order to create more treatment space for Covid-19 patients in public hospitals.\n\nPrivate hospitals in this country have the capacity to assist in managing non-Covid-19 patients effectively, allowing public hospitals to focus on treating Covid-19 cases.\n\n\u201cTreatment of non-Covid-19 patients in private hospitals will be funded by the government based on the circular, but patients can only be referred by their treating doctors in the public hospitals to private based on the condition of the ailment,\u201d Dr Kuljit noted in the statement.\n\nHe added that the take up was not satisfactory as only a small number of referrals have been made.\n\nDr Kuljit noted that there were 31 private hospitals in the Klang Valley currently managing Covid-19 patients in normal wards, as well as in the ICU.", "keyword": ["treatment", "icu", "patients", "deposit", "hike", "price", "private", "cost",

with loss of income because of Covid-19, he has suggested that tour bus drivers be given counselling to help them manage psychological and emotional stress.\n\nAccording to Bernama, Wan Shairi said

the pandemic.\n\n\u201cOn average, the loan repayments for a new tour bus are between RM8,000 and RM12,000 a month. There were also tour bus operators who bought more than one bus at that time.\n\n\u201cHowever, due to the pandemic (restrictions), tour bus operators could not earn any income,\u201d he said at an online press conference today in conjunction with the Malaysia Tourism Council\u2019s (MTC) presentation of special assistance to tour bus drivers affected by the pandemic.\n\nAccording to him, there are 6,404 tour buses nationwide registered with the authorities.\n\nMeanwhile, MTC president Uzaidi Udanis said they managed to raise RM30,000 through an online charity concert at the Malaysia Virtual Experience platform developed by the Malaysia Productivity Corporation on April 30 to be distributed to the tour bus drivers.\n\nHe said the recipients under the first phase involving 100 tour bus drivers would have RM300 each credited into their accounts starting on Monday.\n\nAt the online session, some tour bus drivers also shared their experiences on the difficulty of getting a new job because of their age, which has led to some of them selling satay and working as couriers.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST DATA ON THE COVID-19 SITUATION IN MALAYSIA\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["debt", "shairi", "tour", "drivers", "mtc", "association", "income", "covid19", "death", "wan", "operators", "bus", "online", "stress"], "summary": "KUALA LUMPUR: An association for tour bus drivers is worried for its members after the deaths of four tour bus drivers in the past three months, including one who jumped from a building.\nPertubuhan Gemilang Agensi Pelancongan dan Pengusaha Bas Malaysia\u2019s (GAPP) vice-president Wan Shairi Wan Ahmad said the other three reportedly died from heart disease.\n\u201cOn average, the loan repayments for a new tour bus are between RM8,000 and RM12,000 a month.\nThere were also tour bus operators who bought more than one bus at that time.\nHe said the recipients under the first phase involving 100 tour bus drivers would have RM300 each credited into their accounts starting on Monday.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-05-08 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "MKN\u2019s Official Raya Aidilfitri 2021 SOP As Of 11 May (In English)", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvbWFsYXlzaWEvMjAyMS8wNS8xMi9ta25zLW9mZmljaWFsLXJheWEtYWlkaWxmaXRyaS0yMDIxLXNvcC1hcy1vZi0xMS1tYXktaW4tZW5nbGlzaC_SAXpodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVyYWt5YXRwb3N0LmNvbS9uZXdzL21hbGF5c2lhLzIwMjEvMDUvMTIvbWtucy1vZmZpY2lhbC1yYXlhLWFpZGlsZml0cmktMjAyMS1zb3AtYXMtb2YtMTEtbWF5LWluLWVuZ2xpc2gvYW1wLw?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Hamzah Nazari", "Maya Suraya", "Azizul Rahman Ismail"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Untitled-2020-07-04T133935.618.jpg", "text": "Subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates.\n\nFor your convenience, we\u2019ve translated to English the latest Hari Raya Movement Control Order (MCO) standard operating procedure (SOP) released by the National Security Council (MKN).

The militia, armed mainly with hunting rifles, said it had pulled back to spare civilians from being caught in the crossfire.\n\nSeveral residents reached by Reuters said food was in short supply and estimated as many as 5,000 to 8,000 people had fled the town.
