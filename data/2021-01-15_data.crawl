has been streamlined even further to specific services, after more than a week of the movement control order (MCO) this year.\n\nThe latest update of the MCO regulations gazetted on January 21 and published on the Federal Government Gazette\u2019s website lists 52 items under essential services, instead of 50 items in the January 15 gazette.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s what has changed in the latest list of essential services that can operate during MCO 2.0:\n\nInternet, postal, courier, broadcasting, call centre now specified\n\nIn the January 15 list (old), telecommunications and information technology were grouped together as item 28, but this category of services has been made more detailed in the latest January 21 list (new) by splitting them into item 28 and item 29 and adding new specific services such as call centres and internet services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOld: 28. Telecommunication and digital infrastructures including information and communication technology services and global business services\n\nNew: 28. Communications including telecommunications and internet, postal and courier, and broadcasting\n\n29. Information technology including global business services and call centre\n\nSlight change for e-commerce detail\n\nThe new list includes a slight tweak to the old list in the e-commerce item.\n\nOld: 29. E-commerce including e-marketplace, digital payment and local e-commerce internet centre services\n\nNew: 30: E-commerce including e-marketplace, digital payment and local e-commerce services centre\n\nNew category added on\n\nThis item was not mentioned in the old list.\n\nNew: 31. Digital creative content development in studio including film editing\n\nBoth the old and new lists contain a catch-all phrase of \u201cAny service, work, industry of business as determined by the Minister of Health after consulting the authority that regulates the services, work, industry and business\u201d, which essentially means that any businesses not included in the gazetted list of essential services may still be allowed to operate if the health minister decides that they can operate.\n\nThe new gazetted list takes effect on January 22, and applies to the whole of Malaysia except Sarawak \u2014 Johor, Kedah, Kelantan, Melaka, Negri Sembilan, Pahang, Penang, Perak, Perlis, Sabah, Selangor, Terengganu, Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya, Labuan \u2014 until February 2 which is when MCO is due to end. The new list also applies to Sibu in Sarawak where the MCO is scheduled to end January 29.\n\nThis is not the first time that the government has made changes to the list of essential services allowed to operate during MCO 2.0.\n\nThe Ministry of International Trade and Industry had on January 12 afternoon released a list of essential services for MCO 2.0 that included automotive manufacturing and after-sales services, but updated the list the same evening by removing that exemption and only listing automotive repair and maintenance as an essential service.\n\nThe government in MCO regulations gazetted on January 12 listed the manufacturing and production of \u201cautomotive equipment\u201d as an essential service but did not include automotive repair and maintenance.\n\nThe January 15 gazetted list of essential services updated this to be the manufacturing and production of \u201cautomotive (vehicles and components)\u201d instead of the \u201cautomotive equipment\u201d previously listed, while also adding \u201cautomotive (maintenance and repair)\u201d as a separate business under the services category that is allowed to continue to operate.\n\nThe changes in the list of essential services had resulted in carmakers Hondo, Toyota and Perodua briefly stopping activities in their factories in Malaysia, before resuming operations again.\n\nWhere to get the latest information\n\nIf you are a business owner and want to know about the latest rules, guidelines, standard operating procedures or frequently-asked questions issued by Miti, there is a dedicated section on the ministry\u2019s website with such MCO-related information (https://www.miti.gov.my/redir/pkp/pkp.html).\n\nHowever when Malay Mail visited the Miti website section dedicated to MCO information at around noon on Thursday, various editions \u2014 both old and new \u2014 of the list of essential services were found on the website.\n\nThis dedicated section has six sections: Media release, FAQs, SOPs and gazette, infographic, CIMS 3.0 tutorial video, and email enquiry.\n\nThe FAQ document in the FAQ section which was issued on January 12 by Miti in Bahasa Malaysia, comes with a list of essential services written in Bahasa Malaysia dated January 12.\n\nIn the media release section, a media release in English and issued on January 12 comes with a list of essential services written in English which was updated as of January 16 and sourced from the January 15 gazetted list.\n\nThe infographics section of the site carries two sets of slides or infographics \u2014 one in Bahasa Malaysia and another in English \u2014 on the list of essential services, with this based also on the January 15 gazetted list.\n\nAlso included in the infographics section is a set of slides dated January 20 of the list of 16 businesses allowed by the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) to operate during the MCO, with this list written in Bahasa Malaysia: Shopping complexes or malls, supermarkets and hypermarkets, departmental stores, pharmacies or selling of personal care products, convenience stores or mini marts, laundry shops (not including self-service laundromats), restaurants, furniture stores, jewellery shops, electrics and electronics stores, bookshops and stationery shops, hardware stores, pet food, vehicle workshops or maintenance or spare parts, vehicle sales and distribution centres, speciality retail stores at petrol stations.\n\n(On January 12, senior minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob when announcing the government\u2019s rules for areas under MCO had said that laundry shops except for self-service laundromats will be allowed to operate from 6am to 8pm. Following public complaints, Ismail Sabri however on January 14 said self-service laundromats will also be allowed to operate during MCO, with the condition that a worker is present to ensure physical distancing and check customers\u2019 body temperature. Although optometrists were not included in KPDNHEP\u2019s initial list, the government on January 15 confirmed that they were now allowed by the KPDNHEP to open during MCO based on tighter SOPs.)\n\nIn the SOPs and gazette section on Miti\u2019s MCO site, clicking on the federal gazette would lead to the latest January 21 government gazette containing the latest list of essential services, while the SOPs posted is also the latest National Security Council\u2019s general SOPs for MCO areas which is dated January 21.\n\nAs of noon yesterday, Miti\u2019s Facebook and Twitter accounts have yet to post information regarding the updated details in the gazetted list of essential services allowed to operate.\n\nAs for Sarawak (except for Sibu) which is under the conditional movement control order (CMCO) until January 31, the latest CMCO regulations gazetted by the federal government on January 21 maintains the list of prohibited activities that had been in use in previous editions of CMCO rules.\n\nThe list of prohibited activities under CMCO are: Outbound tour activities by Malaysians and inbound tour activities involving foreign tourists except foreign tourists from countries specified by the health minister, activities in pubs and nightclubs except for restaurant business in pubs and nightclubs, and any activity with many people attending at a place which makes it difficult to carry out physical distancing and to comply with the health director-general\u2019s directions. \u2015 Malay Mail\n\nRelated reading", "keyword": ["operate",

during the first MCO last year.\n\nThis time, he said, the MCO\u2019s purpose was to stabilise the nation\u2019s number of infections which had been on the rise since October 2020.\n\nWe do not want

Now, the middle of the night, there was only fear and some anger. The two sisters had been sent to the house of their \u201cfather\u201d but what they saw was a drunken man and bottles of liquor strewn all over.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t know what to do. We didn\u2019t really know where we were. We just wanted to run away,\u201d Diana tells FMT, recounting the horrific day.\n\nDiana and Dorothy had spent nearly all their lives in a children\u2019s home in Buntong, but after being caught recording the bullying and emotional abuse kids at the home faced, they had been sent away.\n\nThe girls said the home\u2019s caretaker sent them away at night to \u201clive with their father\u201d, a person they\u2019ve never even met, in a shack in a rural village in Batu Gajah.\n\nAt the house, they said, bottles of cheap liquor were strewn on the floor, and Diana says the man they were told was their father was drunk and slurring. Another foreign couple lived in the house too.\n\nFortunately, nothing untoward happened that night. The next day, the two girls told their \u201cfather\u201d they were going to a nearby sundry shop and ran off to tell passers-by of their plight. They were put in touch with an NGO that helped people in distress.\n\nThe NGO called Persatuan Harapan India Malaysia came to the girls\u2019 rescue after being told of their ordeal, and the plight others faced at the children\u2019s home.\n\nM Manimaran, the group\u2019s president, said he was shocked to hear what was happening in the children\u2019s home, and since then, has managed to rescue six children and placed them in another home.\n\nFMT is withholding the name of the home pending a comment from its management.\n\nManimaran has also lodged a police report and filed a complaint with the Welfare Department.\n\nDiana says children at the home are often bullied and scolded by the caretakers.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of kind people who donate things to the home, but these items get taken away. We are also threatened against speaking about what happens at the home.\u201d\n\nThey claimed the children are also being given Christian names and are forced to attend activities at a church.\n\nA pair of sisters rescued from the home, Salvander Kaur Vikram Singh, 17 and Elvina Kaur, 14, also spoke of their traumatic experiences at the home.\n\nThe girls from Johor were sent to the children\u2019s home as their parents could not afford to provide them a good education.\n\n\u201cMy sister and I were threatened that if we did not obey (what the caretakers demanded), they would cut our hair short.\u201d Sikh men and women do not cut their hair, as part of their practice.\n\n\u201cThey forced us to go to church and pray. If we refused, they would threaten to call our parents. There are times our parents did call but they could not speak to us because they were told we were busy studying or not around, when in fact we were there.\u201d\n\nElvina actually had her hair cut short as punishment for refusing to listen to a caretaker\u2019s demands.\n\n\u201cNow my sister and I are no longer there, we are happy.

It is still being reviewed,\u201d he said.\n\nBased on social media postings and a quick survey done by The Malaysian Reserve (TMR), many are of the opinion that the shorter operating hours of eateries during the MCO has increased the burden of the rakyat.\n\nRestoran Mahsuri owner Afnan Aiman said the move to allow businesses, eateries and shops to only operate from 6am to 8pm has caused more hardship to the rakyat, instead of helping them.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s not okay. Businesses have been a little slow because now we can\u2019t dine in and time is too limited because people would usually finish work at 6pm or much later, and by the time they reach home, there\u2019s not enough time to buy food because we\u2019re already closed.\n\n\u201cWhen this happens, it affects our businesses and sales have been shrinking,\u201d he told TMR.\n\nHe said if operating hours can be extended until 10pm, all restaurant operators will feel a little relieved and satisfied because most of them have more sales at night.\n\n\u201cAny restaurant, they depend more on customers who come at night. If the government is willing to extend the time, 10pm is already okay for us.\u201d\n\nAfnan also opined that the country\u2019s political instability has put a great weight on businesses, making people\u2019s lives more difficult than it already is.\n\n\u201cWe know Covid-19 is dangerous, why would the politicians want to take advantage at a time like this by holding elections and asking people to choose leaders?\n\n\u201cTo me, all of that is unnecessary. They should solve this problem first before their politics. If they can\u2019t help us, don\u2019t help us.\u201d\n\nKedai Kopi Payung owner Nor Baizura Jamil told TMR the operating hours were pleasant at first as it gives time for her to close shop early and rest.\n\n\u201cBut from an economic standpoint, sales have been down to half of what we made before. We have experienced a lot of our customers trying to come and buy food around 6pm or before we close.\u201d\n\nShe also believes that it is better to extend the operating hours so that businesses can run accordingly to reach its sales targets and customers will not feel distressed.\n\nThe situation has caused quite the stir on Twitter when the hashtag #SiBodohKauDengarSini, which translates to \u201cListen here, idiot\u201d, became a trending topic recently.\n\nIt all started when user @farhanazahan complained about not having dinner two nights in a row and that he faced problems while ordering food even though he placed an early order at 5pm.\n\nHe also tweeted that compared to Ismail Sabri, he does not have a maid to serve food at home when he gets back from work.\n\nAnother user @puterirajaawan replied that she \u201cdoes not understand people who create problems out of everything\u201d.\n\nShe suggested ordering the food early to store it in the fridge and reheat it the next day.\n\nThis elicited a response from @yarafaee_ whose tweet started with \u201cSi bodoh, kau dengar sini\u201d before elaborating that food delivery platforms are facing technical problems to fulfil substantial orders during a short window.\n\n\u201cPeople who got back from work do not have time to cook because they have to get up early the next day to go back to work.\u201d\n\nShe also tweeted \u201cinstead of telling the rakyat to find a way, why not ask the government to extend operating hours?\u201d", "keyword": ["govt", "problems", "hours", "early", "closing", "8pm", "instead", "short", "extend", "operating", "reconsiders", "sales", "food", "businesses"], "summary": "Based on social media postings and a quick survey done by The Malaysian Reserve (TMR), many are of the opinion that the shorter operating hours of eateries during the MCO has increased the burden of the rakyat.\nRestoran Mahsuri owner Afnan Aiman said the move to allow businesses, eateries and shops to only operate from 6am to 8pm has caused more hardship to the rakyat, instead of helping them.\n\u201cWhen this happens, it affects our businesses and sales have been shrinking,\u201d he told TMR.\nHe said if operating hours can be extended until 10pm, all restaurant operators will feel a little relieved and satisfied because most of them have more sales at night.\nShe suggested ordering the food early to store it in the fridge and reheat it the next day.", "news": "The Malaysian Reserve", "date": "2021-01-20 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Kapayan rep urges state government to expedite aid efforts to flood victims in Penampang", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVib3JuZW9wb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzAxLzE3L2thcGF5YW4tcmVwLXVyZ2VzLXN0YXRlLWdvdmVybm1lbnQtdG8tZXhwZWRpdGUtYWlkLWVmZm9ydHMtdG8tZmxvb2QtdmljdGltcy1pbi1wZW5hbXBhbmcv0gEA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2021/01/WhatsApp-Image-2021-01-17-at-13.02.58.jpeg", "text": "KOTA KINABALU (Jan 17): Kapayan assemblywoman Jannie Lasimbang urges the Gabungan Rakyat Sabah (GRS) state government to expedite efforts to send assistance to those affected by the flood in Penampang and other districts.\n\nJannie also urged the government to continue to source for funds for the flood mitigation project in Penampang.\n\nJannie in a statement today said she was saddened to see Donggongon township and surrounding villages like Kampung Hungab, Kampung Tunoh, Bundusan as well as a few housing estates there flooded again.\n\n\u201cDuring my time in government, I have tried to find a solution to the flooding problem.

Here, crop losses have been unavoidable as many sections of the fields have been under 2ft to 3ft of water for two to three weeks,\u201d said Carl Bek-Nielsen, chief executive (CEO) of United Plantations Bhd.\n\n\u201cThis adversely affects the ability to enter the fields and harvest the crop, let alone bring out the crop as fields are under water.\u201d\n\nIn Sarawak, Malaysia\u2019s second-biggest palm growing state, the drop in yields may be more severe than the 15% to 20% initially estimated over the next two months, according to Andrew Cheng, CEO of the Sarawak Oil Palm Plantation Owners Association.\n\nThat is because the acute worker shortage compounds production problems caused by floodwaters which have inundated plantations and interrupted harvesting, he said.\n\n\u201cI believe many oil palm plantations in Sarawak\u2019s lower-lying areas will be affected, especially with the King Tide coming in,\u201d Cheng said, referring to an especially high tide, which may lead to prolonged flooding.\n\n\u201cDue to the Covid-19 pandemic and the movement control order, we are unable to assess the overall situation.\u201d Sarawak makes up about 21% of the country\u2019s total palm oil output.\n\nBreaking point\n\nMalaysia\u2019s shortage of palm oil workers has become \u201cmuch, much worse\u201d compared with six months ago, and was likely responsible for up to 90% of the 3.6 million tonnes of fresh fruit bunches lost last year, Bek-Nielsen said.\n\n\u201cWe are at a breaking point that will result in considerable crop losses in 2021,\u201d he said. While first quarter production will not be much lower than last quarter, the impact from the acute labour shortage \u201cwill really start to bite and impact production from April to October\u201d, leading to a drop in output this year to 18.6 million tonnes. Output was 19.14 million tonnes in 2020.\n\nTo relieve the shortage of foreign workers, planters are seeking government approval for a safe way to bring guest workers into Malaysia, where all Covid-19 testing and quarantine costs are borne by employers, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, FGV Holdings Bhd, one of the country\u2019s biggest producers, said about 3,600ha in Pahang, Johor, Perak, Negeri Sembilan and Sabah were affected by flash floods, although there is no serious impact to field operations and mills are running as usual despite a drop in daily volumes.\n\nStill, there will be a \u201cslight impact on yield production due to weather affecting labour productivity in January and in the first quarter\u201d, it said in emailed responses. \u201cWe estimate the potential reduction in yields to be about 20% for January as compared with the earlier month, and by almost 20% in 1Q from the earlier period.\u201d\n\nIn Indonesia, the world\u2019s top producer, plantations have not been affected by the recent flooding in South Kalimantan, according to the Indonesian Palm Oil Association, or Gapki.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["oil", "labour", "crop", "whammy", "double", "floods", "output",

of Malaysia (Suhakam) regarding deaths in custody should be used to find justice for families of victims, and not be criticised.\n\nRights group Suara Rakyat Malaysia (Suaram), responding to criticism over the limits of Suhakam\u2019s investigative powers, said the inquiries should not been seen as mutually exclusive from the judicial process, and should instead be used as further proof to ensure those responsible are held accountable.\n\n\u201cWe are of the opinion that, if Suhakam\u2019s findings are consistent with what the families are claiming, then they should be used as an additional proof or evidence to expose the violations and strengthen the legal challenges against the police,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cWe owe it to the victims of police misconduct to explore and use every available mechanism to shine a light on the human rights violations experienced and seek justice when we can.\u201d\n\nIt said the pursuit of justice should not be limited to a few institutions and figures, and must involve a collective effort with a variety of groups.\n\nSuaram lamented the limits that have been placed on Suhakam\u2019s powers by the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia Act 1999, which it says has long \u201chobbled\u201d the institution.\n\nOne example that has been openly debated over the last week is Section 12(2), which stops the commission from inquiring into any complaint once it is before a judicial inquiry, which Suaram said had been the reason for a number of prior investigations being dropped.\n\n\u201cCivil societies have always addressed the inadequacies of the Act and pushed Suhakam to address human rights violations in a broader sense and push the boundaries within its restricted mandate and powers.\u201d\n\nRecently, the non-governmental organisation Eliminating Deaths and Abuse in Custody Together (EDICT) had told Suhakam to stop its inquiries into custodial deaths after it said G Jestus Kevin had died as a result of

The chants in the evenings and mornings add to the ambiance of this town.\n\nSuicide Point\n\nSuicide Point is 5km away from the town, so if you\u2019re looking for that perfect cliffside Instagram picture, this is the place for it.\n\nVillage tour\n\nKalpa is a self-sustaining village with a lot of organic farming activity going on. You can take a stroll to the farm or visit the old heritage houses in and around the village.\n\nApple Orchard tour\n\nKalpa has many apple orchards and if you are visiting during the harvest season, which is around August or October, be sure to visit them.\n\nAmit and Anindita are Indian Travel bloggers who blog at Travel Like We Do.

Azrul Mohd Khalib\n\nThere is an alarming emerging trend of resident associations and condominium managements requiring the disclosure of confidential medical information related to the Covid-19 status of people living in their neighbourhood.\n\nThere are demands for PCR or antigen test results, copies of passports and pictures of those who are positive. Most are aimed at foreigners. Residents are encouraged to inform on their neighbours. All being done supposedly in the name of collective protection, safety, and security.\n\nThis is a challenging and uncertain time for everyone.\n\nWith daily new Covid-19 numbers reaching record numbers, no peak in sight to the third wave, and more people in our communities, workplaces and families becoming infected, it is natural that we become increasingly fearful and insecure, not just for ourselves but also our loved ones.\n\nThe threat of death and disease, coupled with the general lack of knowledge of how Covid-19 spreads, and the need to blame someone for the pain and suffering that we see among those infected and affected, have led to a cloud of stigma.\n\nStigma now surrounds Covid-19, the people and communities who have contracted the disease. It is causing prejudice, discrimination, and xenophobia, widening inequalities, increasing vulnerabilities to violence, harassment and ostracisation, and hampering public health measures intended to manage the epidemic.\n\nThere are increasing reports of people and families who have recovered from infection or been released from home isolation or quarantine, being marginalised, or ostracised by their neighbours, family members, communities, and even loved ones, resulting in additional anxiety, and falling into depression.\n\nPeople have been blamed for supposedly bringing Covid-19 into housing areas and condominium complexes. Fingers were pointed at migrant workers when they were disproportionately represented in the daily statistics, which led to crackdowns by authorities, and caused fear and anxiety among even documented foreigners.\n\nFormer patients have lost jobs after their recovery. Families have been told to leave their rented homes. Tragically, out of a sense of overwhelming shame and fear of being a burden to their loved ones, some patients have recently taken their own lives. The list of consequences due to Covid-19-related stigma goes on.\n\nAll around the world, for those who have worked on AIDS for the past four decades, this sounds altogether too familiar. The same challenges, problems and harm of stigma and discrimination seen in that epidemic are manifesting themselves in the Covid-19 pandemic. But amid the ongoing tragedy, there is an opportunity.\n\nWe can apply what we have learnt from 40 years of the HIV-AIDS epidemic to what is happening today, in order to address the Covid-19 stigma. We do not need to repeat the same mistakes. We should not lose more lives through abuse, harm and suffering caused by Covid-19 prejudice and discrimination.\n\nIn our fear and frustration, we must resist adopting draconian measures that degrade or compromise on human rights and dignity.\n\nPast successful responses to public health emergencies have demonstrated repeatedly the value of grounding them in human rights.\n\nWe have learnt the hard way from the HIV-AIDS epidemic, that approaches which depend on punitive measures, shaming and discrimination undermine public health objectives and eventually fail in the long run. They end up doing more harm than good.\n\nSolidarity, empathy, and compassion reduce suffering, protect public health and save lives.\n\nNew Zealand has shown that when empathy and compassion are coupled with competence and firmness, the Covid-19 outbreak can be managed effectively and decisively.\n\nHumanise Covid-19 pandemic\n\nTo address Covid-19 stigma, we can do better in four areas.\n\nFirstly, we must humanise the Covid-19 pandemic. Today, the people and lives who have been touched by this disease are almost entirely represented by the health ministry\u2019s daily reported numbers of those infected, recovered, needing intensive care, placed on ventilator support, and who have died.\n\nThe human face of Malaysia\u2019s response to the outbreak is largely missing from these statistics.\n\nAside from what is shared online in social media, there are barely any stories in the mainstream media of people and their lived experiences of being infected and surviving, of the lives that have been lost. This has contributed to the fear, misinformation and stigma surrounding Covid-19.\n\nThe right to confidentiality and privacy of medical information should be protected. However, there are many who are willing and have volunteered to share their experiences, as patients, caregivers, emergency services and healthcare workers.\n\nGiving an opportunity for stories to be broadcast, especially those that are positive and uplifting, will go a long way in dealing with the ignorance and misunderstanding surrounding the disease and towards building a Covid-19 response that is free from stigma and discrimination.\n\nHealthcare workers, who have been at the forefront of the response to this public health emergency for a year now, have resorted to either posting on social media or covertly sharing their pain, suffering and frustrations with trusted media outlets.\n\nMany hope that by doing so, they would inform the public about what is happening in our hospitals and healthcare facilities, the day-to-day realities, and possibly gain public support and empathy.\n\nThe fact that they are forced to do so, often in a discreet manner largely to protect themselves from official repercussions, is a disservice to the sacrifices that they and their families have made. They should not have to do this. We need to highlight their stories in the media, listen to their appeals and respond to their requests for assistance.\n\nSecondly, we need to correct negative language that can fuel fear and stigma. We must avoid the use of stereotypical, negative expressions that can create or increase stigma, and focus on inclusive language.\n\nCommunities at risk or vulnerable to Covid-19 infection have been described as time bombs, fuelling fear and suspicion. Contracting Covid-19 does not mean someone has less value than anyone else.\n\nThe migrant worker community, for example, despite their obvious vulnerability and lack of adequate efforts to protect them, has been unfairly blamed for the outbreak, especially in the third wave.\n\nThirdly, a lesson learnt from people living with HIV is that: \u201cIf you take away our jobs, you will kill us faster than the virus.\u201d\n\nIn our response to dealing with Covid-19, we need to also protect jobs and people\u2019s livelihoods. Covid-19 and the resulting lockdowns have caused tremendous and unprecedented economic turmoil and impacted thousands of households.\n\nDue to lockdowns and closure of economic activities, it has deprived people of livelihoods and caused many families to slip closer towards or deeper into poverty. It is essential that those affected by Covid-19 face no stigma in returning to their jobs. Workers should not fear that they might lose their jobs if they test positive for Covid-19.\n\nPunitive laws do not work\n\nFinally, a key lesson from the HIV response is that exclusion and punitive laws do not work.\n\nEvery day, from the start of the first movement control order, we have heard how many people have been fined or arrested for SOP violations. Rather than contribute towards reductions in the number of people being infected with Covid-19, what it has achieved instead, is create an atmosphere of fear and resentment towards authorities especially with the appearance of double standards.\n\nMany, particularly those from lower income backgrounds have become victims of subjective enforcement.\n\nWith the number of new Covid-19 cases reaching record numbers, this emphasis on a punitive approach to disease prevention and control should be reviewed.\n\nThis is a public health emergency, not a war. There are no winners or losers, good sides or bad sides.\n\nIn this public health crisis, we need to look to our common humanity. Anyone can get infected during this global pandemic. Covid-19 does not discriminate, and neither should our response.\n\nWe should treat the individuals and communities affected by Covid-19 the same way how we would wish ourselves to be treated, with empathy and compassion. Government, community leaders and public health officials can lead by example and help prevent stigma and discrimination.\n\nNo one is safe until we are all safe, and stopping stigma is critical to making our communities safer and healthier. We need to work together to prevent and address stigma.\n\nAzrul Mohd Khalib is the head of Galen Centre for Health & Social Policy and is an FMT reader.\n\nThe views expressed are those of the writer

The next few years will decide whether Samsung will become, say, a global platform company or remain a hardware company,\u201d he said.\n\nLee, 52, has been the de facto head of Samsung Electronics since his father, Lee Kun-hee, was hospitalised after a heart attack in 2014.\n\nThe elder Lee died in October, but the chairmanship he held has yet to be filled, and uncertainty cast by his son\u2019s legal troubles was the chief reason, analysts said.\n\nVice-chairman since 2012, Lee has yet to make a mark \u2013 as his father did \u2013 by building the semiconductor business, which now brings in half of Samsung Electronics profits.\n\nAmid the moves meant to ensure his succession, Lee has fought against allegations of legal wrongdoing, including a year in prison in 2017-2018 over a bribery case involving impeached President Park Geun-hye.\n\nFlagship businesses\n\nOne of Lee\u2019s focuses is Samsung\u2019s non-memory chip business, including chip contract manufacturing, calling on the staff to \u201ccreate another legend\u201d.\n\nSamsung plans to invest US$121.47 billion in non-memory chips through 2030 to become No 1, including in chip contract manufacturing, where its 17% market share is a distant second to current No 1 TSMC\u2019s 54%, according to TrendForce.\n\nSamsung has also touted Lee\u2019s deal-making skills in winning a US$6.6 billion contract from Verizon last year, describing the network equipment business \u2013 still small compared with that of rivals like Huawei \u2013 as a key business area.\n\nLee also needs to deal with paying inheritance tax to maintain control of the tech giant. Since Lee Kun-hee passed away, an estimated US$10.05 billion in inheritance tax is expected to be needed for his family to inherit his listed stockholdings alone.\n\nAnd he faces a separate trial over suspected accounting fraud and stock price manipulation connected to a 2015 merger that helped him assume greater control of Samsung Electronics.\n\nSuper-class company\n\nUrbane, reserved and media-shy, Lee has shown a relaxed side in public more recently after his release from detention.\n\nHe has been pictured eating lunch in staff cafeterias, taking selfies with employees, and smiling brightly when President Moon Jae-in visited a Samsung worksite in April 2019.\n\nIn May, he said he would not hand over management rights to his children and apologised for the behaviour of executives caught sabotaging labour union activities.\n\n\u201cA true super-class company is a sustainable company \u2026 I want to make a new Samsung,\u201d Lee said during his final statement to the court in December.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["business", "legal", "company", "lee", "manufacturing", "stepping", "samsung", "jaeyong", "shadow", "samsungs", "contract", "electronics", "cusp", "including", "chip", "fathers"], "summary": "SEOUL: For years, legal troubles have cast a cloud over Samsung Electronics Vice-Chairman Lee Jae-yong as he stood on the cusp of stepping out of his father\u2019s shadow and making a name for himself as the leader of the global tech giant.\nLee, 52, has been the de facto head of Samsung Electronics since his father, Lee Kun-hee, was hospitalised after a heart attack in 2014.\nFlagship businessesOne of Lee\u2019s focuses is Samsung\u2019s non-memory chip business, including chip contract manufacturing, calling on the staff to \u201ccreate another legend\u201d.\nAnd he faces a separate trial over suspected accounting fraud and stock price manipulation connected to a 2015 merger that helped him assume greater control of Samsung Electronics.\n\u201cA true super-class company is a sustainable company \u2026 I want to make a new Samsung,\u201d Lee said during his final statement to the court in December.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-01-17 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Insurance companies seeking ways to ease patients\u2019 expenses", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wMS8xNy9pbnN1cmFuY2UtY29tcGFuaWVzLXNlZWtpbmctd2F5cy10by1lYXNlLXBhdGllbnRzLWV4cGVuc2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/admission-registration-counter-sunway-medical-fb.jpg", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: Insurance and takaful companies said today they are working with the health ministry and Bank Negara Malaysia to explore ways to ease some of the expenses of Covid-19 patients who are treated in private hospitals.\n\nIn a joint statement, the Life Insurance Association of Malaysia, General Insurance Association of Malaysia and Malaysian Takaful Association said pandemic-related risks are generally not covered under any insurance and takaful plans worldwide.\n\n\u201cThe exclusion stems from the difficulty in pricing for coverage relating to an event like a pandemic that may occur once in a lifetime, having an incalculable impact and cost.

has been streamlined even further to specific services, after more than a week of the movement control order (MCO) this year.\n\nThe latest update of the MCO regulations gazetted on January 21 and published on the Federal Government Gazette\u2019s website lists 52 items under essential services, instead of 50 items in the January 15 gazette.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s what has changed in the latest list of essential services that can operate during MCO 2.0:\n\nInternet, postal, courier, broadcasting, call centre now specified\n\nIn the January 15 list (old), telecommunications and information technology were grouped together as item 28, but this category of services has been made more detailed in the latest January 21 list (new) by splitting them into item 28 and item 29 and adding new specific services such as call centres and internet services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOld: 28. Telecommunication and digital infrastructures including information and communication technology services and global business services\n\nNew: 28. Communications including telecommunications and internet, postal and courier, and broadcasting\n\n29. Information technology including global business services and call centre\n\nSlight change for e-commerce detail\n\nThe new list includes a slight tweak to the old list in the e-commerce item.\n\nOld: 29. E-commerce including e-marketplace, digital payment and local e-commerce internet centre services\n\nNew: 30: E-commerce including e-marketplace, digital payment and local e-commerce services centre\n\nNew category added on\n\nThis item was not mentioned in the old list.\n\nNew: 31. Digital creative content development in studio including film editing\n\nBoth the old and new lists contain a catch-all phrase of \u201cAny service, work, industry of business as determined by the Minister of Health after consulting the authority that regulates the services, work, industry and business\u201d, which essentially means that any businesses not included in the gazetted list of essential services may still be allowed to operate if the health minister decides that they can operate.\n\nThe new gazetted list takes effect on January 22, and applies to the whole of Malaysia except Sarawak \u2014 Johor, Kedah, Kelantan, Melaka, Negri Sembilan, Pahang, Penang, Perak, Perlis, Sabah, Selangor, Terengganu, Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya, Labuan \u2014 until February 2 which is when MCO is due to end. The new list also applies to Sibu in Sarawak where the MCO is scheduled to end January 29.\n\nThis is not the first time that the government has made changes to the list of essential services allowed to operate during MCO 2.0.\n\nThe Ministry of International Trade and Industry had on January 12 afternoon released a list of essential services for MCO 2.0 that included automotive manufacturing and after-sales services, but updated the list the same evening by removing that exemption and only listing automotive repair and maintenance as an essential service.\n\nThe government in MCO regulations gazetted on January 12 listed the manufacturing and production of \u201cautomotive equipment\u201d as an essential service but did not include automotive repair and maintenance.\n\nThe January 15 gazetted list of essential services updated this to be the manufacturing and production of \u201cautomotive (vehicles and components)\u201d instead of the \u201cautomotive equipment\u201d previously listed, while also adding \u201cautomotive (maintenance and repair)\u201d as a separate business under the services category that is allowed to continue to operate.\n\nThe changes in the list of essential services had resulted in carmakers Hondo, Toyota and Perodua briefly stopping activities in their factories in Malaysia, before resuming operations again.\n\nWhere to get the latest information\n\nIf you are a business owner and want to know about the latest rules, guidelines, standard operating procedures or frequently-asked questions issued by Miti, there is a dedicated section on the ministry\u2019s website with such MCO-related information (https://www.miti.gov.my/redir/pkp/pkp.html).\n\nHowever when Malay Mail visited the Miti website section dedicated to MCO information at around noon on Thursday, various editions \u2014 both old and new \u2014 of the list of essential services were found on the website.\n\nThis dedicated section has six sections: Media release, FAQs, SOPs and gazette, infographic, CIMS 3.0 tutorial video, and email enquiry.\n\nThe FAQ document in the FAQ section which was issued on January 12 by Miti in Bahasa Malaysia, comes with a list of essential services written in Bahasa Malaysia dated January 12.\n\nIn the media release section, a media release in English and issued on January 12 comes with a list of essential services written in English which was updated as of January 16 and sourced from the January 15 gazetted list.\n\nThe infographics section of the site carries two sets of slides or infographics \u2014 one in Bahasa Malaysia and another in English \u2014 on the list of essential services, with this based also on the January 15 gazetted list.\n\nAlso included in the infographics section is a set of slides dated January 20 of the list of 16 businesses allowed by the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) to operate during the MCO, with this list written in Bahasa Malaysia: Shopping complexes or malls, supermarkets and hypermarkets, departmental stores, pharmacies or selling of personal care products, convenience stores or mini marts, laundry shops (not including self-service laundromats), restaurants, furniture stores, jewellery shops, electrics and electronics stores, bookshops and stationery shops, hardware stores, pet food, vehicle workshops or maintenance or spare parts, vehicle sales and distribution centres, speciality retail stores at petrol stations.\n\n(On January 12, senior minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob when announcing the government\u2019s rules for areas under MCO had said that laundry shops except for self-service laundromats will be allowed to operate from 6am to 8pm. Following public complaints, Ismail Sabri however on January 14 said self-service laundromats will also be allowed to operate during MCO, with the condition that a worker is present to ensure physical distancing and check customers\u2019 body temperature. Although optometrists were not included in KPDNHEP\u2019s initial list, the government on January 15 confirmed that they were now allowed by the KPDNHEP to open during MCO based on tighter SOPs.)\n\nIn the SOPs and gazette section on Miti\u2019s MCO site, clicking on the federal gazette would lead to the latest January 21 government gazette containing the latest list of essential services, while the SOPs posted is also the latest National Security Council\u2019s general SOPs for MCO areas which is dated January 21.\n\nAs of noon yesterday, Miti\u2019s Facebook and Twitter accounts have yet to post information regarding the updated details in the gazetted list of essential services allowed to operate.\n\nAs for Sarawak (except for Sibu) which is under the conditional movement control order (CMCO) until January 31, the latest CMCO regulations gazetted by the federal government on January 21 maintains the list of prohibited activities that had been in use in previous editions of CMCO rules.\n\nThe list of prohibited activities under CMCO are: Outbound tour activities by Malaysians and inbound tour activities involving foreign tourists except foreign tourists from countries specified by the health minister, activities in pubs and nightclubs except for restaurant business in pubs and nightclubs, and any activity with many people attending at a place which makes it difficult to carry out physical distancing and to comply with the health director-general\u2019s directions. \u2015 Malay Mail\n\nRelated reading", "keyword": ["operate",

during the first MCO last year.\n\nThis time, he said, the MCO\u2019s purpose was to stabilise the nation\u2019s number of infections which had been on the rise since October 2020.\n\nWe do not want

It is still being reviewed,\u201d he said.\n\nBased on social media postings and a quick survey done by The Malaysian Reserve (TMR), many are of the opinion that the shorter operating hours of eateries during the MCO has increased the burden of the rakyat.\n\nRestoran Mahsuri owner Afnan Aiman said the move to allow businesses, eateries and shops to only operate from 6am to 8pm has caused more hardship to the rakyat, instead of helping them.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s not okay. Businesses have been a little slow because now we can\u2019t dine in and time is too limited because people would usually finish work at 6pm or much later, and by the time they reach home, there\u2019s not enough time to buy food because we\u2019re already closed.\n\n\u201cWhen this happens, it affects our businesses and sales have been shrinking,\u201d he told TMR.\n\nHe said if operating hours can be extended until 10pm, all restaurant operators will feel a little relieved and satisfied because most of them have more sales at night.\n\n\u201cAny restaurant, they depend more on customers who come at night. If the government is willing to extend the time, 10pm is already okay for us.\u201d\n\nAfnan also opined that the country\u2019s political instability has put a great weight on businesses, making people\u2019s lives more difficult than it already is.\n\n\u201cWe know Covid-19 is dangerous, why would the politicians want to take advantage at a time like this by holding elections and asking people to choose leaders?\n\n\u201cTo me, all of that is unnecessary.

Here, crop losses have been unavoidable as many sections of the fields have been under 2ft to 3ft of water for two to three weeks,\u201d said Carl Bek-Nielsen, chief executive (CEO) of United Plantations Bhd.\n\n\u201cThis adversely affects the ability to enter the fields and harvest the crop, let alone bring out the crop as fields are under water.\u201d\n\nIn Sarawak, Malaysia\u2019s second-biggest palm growing state, the drop in yields may be more severe than the 15% to 20% initially estimated over the next two months, according to Andrew Cheng, CEO of the Sarawak Oil Palm Plantation Owners Association.\n\nThat is because the acute worker shortage compounds production problems caused by floodwaters which have inundated plantations and interrupted harvesting, he said.\n\n\u201cI believe many oil palm plantations in Sarawak\u2019s lower-lying areas will be affected, especially with the King Tide coming in,\u201d Cheng said, referring to an especially high tide, which may lead to prolonged flooding.\n\n\u201cDue to the Covid-19 pandemic and the movement control order, we are unable to assess the overall situation.\u201d Sarawak makes up about 21% of the country\u2019s total palm oil output.\n\nBreaking point\n\nMalaysia\u2019s shortage of palm oil workers has become \u201cmuch, much worse\u201d compared with six months ago, and was likely responsible for up to 90% of the 3.6 million tonnes of fresh fruit bunches lost last year, Bek-Nielsen said.\n\n\u201cWe are at a breaking point that will result in considerable crop losses in 2021,\u201d he said. While first quarter production will not be much lower than last quarter, the impact from the acute labour shortage \u201cwill really start to bite and impact production from April to October\u201d, leading to a drop in output this year to 18.6 million tonnes. Output was 19.14 million tonnes in 2020.\n\nTo relieve the shortage of foreign workers, planters are seeking government approval for a safe way to bring guest workers into Malaysia, where all Covid-19 testing and quarantine costs are borne by employers, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, FGV Holdings Bhd, one of the country\u2019s biggest producers, said about 3,600ha in Pahang, Johor, Perak, Negeri Sembilan and Sabah were affected by flash floods, although there is no serious impact to field operations and mills are running as usual despite a drop in daily volumes.\n\nStill, there will be a \u201cslight impact on yield production due to weather affecting labour productivity in January and in the first quarter\u201d, it said in emailed responses. \u201cWe estimate the potential reduction in yields to be about 20% for January as compared with the earlier month, and by almost 20% in 1Q from the earlier period.\u201d\n\nIn Indonesia, the world\u2019s top producer, plantations have not been affected by the recent flooding in South Kalimantan, according to the Indonesian Palm Oil Association, or Gapki.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["oil", "labour", "crop", "whammy", "double", "floods", "output",

Azrul Mohd Khalib\n\nThere is an alarming emerging trend of resident associations and condominium managements requiring the disclosure of confidential medical information related to the Covid-19 status of people living in their neighbourhood.\n\nThere are demands for PCR or antigen test results, copies of passports and pictures of those who are positive. Most are aimed at foreigners. Residents are encouraged to inform on their neighbours. All being done supposedly in the name of collective protection, safety, and security.\n\nThis is a challenging and uncertain time for everyone.\n\nWith daily new Covid-19 numbers reaching record numbers, no peak in sight to the third wave, and more people in our communities, workplaces and families becoming infected, it is natural that we become increasingly fearful and insecure, not just for ourselves but also our loved ones.\n\nThe threat of death and disease, coupled with the general lack of knowledge of how Covid-19 spreads, and the need to blame someone for the pain and suffering that we see among those infected and affected, have led to a cloud of stigma.\n\nStigma now surrounds Covid-19, the people and communities who have contracted the disease. It is causing prejudice, discrimination, and xenophobia, widening inequalities, increasing vulnerabilities to violence, harassment and ostracisation, and hampering public health measures intended to manage the epidemic.\n\nThere are increasing reports of people and families who have recovered from infection or been released from home isolation or quarantine, being marginalised, or ostracised by their neighbours, family members, communities, and even loved ones, resulting in additional anxiety, and falling into depression.\n\nPeople have been blamed for supposedly bringing Covid-19 into housing areas and condominium complexes. Fingers were pointed at migrant workers when they were disproportionately represented in the daily statistics, which led to crackdowns by authorities, and caused fear and anxiety among even documented foreigners.\n\nFormer patients have lost jobs after their recovery. Families have been told to leave their rented homes. Tragically, out of a sense of overwhelming shame and fear of being a burden to their loved ones, some patients have recently taken their own lives. The list of consequences due to Covid-19-related stigma goes on.\n\nAll around the world, for those who have worked on AIDS for the past four decades, this sounds altogether too familiar. The same challenges, problems and harm of stigma and discrimination seen in that epidemic are manifesting themselves in the Covid-19 pandemic. But amid the ongoing tragedy, there is an opportunity.\n\nWe can apply what we have learnt from 40 years of the HIV-AIDS epidemic to what is happening today, in order to address the Covid-19 stigma. We do not need to repeat the same mistakes. We should not lose more lives through abuse, harm and suffering caused by Covid-19 prejudice and discrimination.\n\nIn our fear and frustration, we must resist adopting draconian measures that degrade or compromise on human rights and dignity.\n\nPast successful responses to public health emergencies have demonstrated repeatedly the value of grounding them in human rights.\n\nWe have learnt the hard way from the HIV-AIDS epidemic, that approaches which depend on punitive measures, shaming and discrimination undermine public health objectives and eventually fail in the long run. They end up doing more harm than good.\n\nSolidarity, empathy, and compassion reduce suffering, protect public health and save lives.\n\nNew Zealand has shown that when empathy and compassion are coupled with competence and firmness, the Covid-19 outbreak can be managed effectively and decisively.\n\nHumanise Covid-19 pandemic\n\nTo address Covid-19 stigma, we can do better in four areas.\n\nFirstly, we must humanise the Covid-19 pandemic. Today, the people and lives who have been touched by this disease are almost entirely represented by the health ministry\u2019s daily reported numbers of those infected, recovered, needing intensive care, placed on ventilator support, and who have died.\n\nThe human face of Malaysia\u2019s response to the outbreak is largely missing from these statistics.\n\nAside from what is shared online in social media, there are barely any stories in the mainstream media of people and their lived experiences of being infected and surviving, of the lives that have been lost. This has contributed to the fear, misinformation and stigma surrounding Covid-19.\n\nThe right to confidentiality and privacy of medical information should be protected. However, there are many who are willing and have volunteered to share their experiences, as patients, caregivers, emergency services and healthcare workers.\n\nGiving an opportunity for stories to be broadcast, especially those that are positive and uplifting, will go a long way in dealing with the ignorance and misunderstanding surrounding the disease and towards building a Covid-19 response that is free from stigma and discrimination.\n\nHealthcare workers, who have been at the forefront of the response to this public health emergency for a year now, have resorted to either posting on social media or covertly sharing their pain, suffering and frustrations with trusted media outlets.\n\nMany hope that by doing so, they would inform the public about what is happening in our hospitals and healthcare facilities, the day-to-day realities, and possibly gain public support and empathy.\n\nThe fact that they are forced to do so, often in a discreet manner largely to protect themselves from official repercussions, is a disservice to the sacrifices that they and their families have made. They should not have to do this. We need to highlight their stories in the media, listen to their appeals and respond to their requests for assistance.\n\nSecondly, we need to correct negative language that can fuel fear and stigma. We must avoid the use of stereotypical, negative expressions that can create or increase stigma, and focus on inclusive language.\n\nCommunities at risk or vulnerable to Covid-19 infection have been described as time bombs, fuelling fear and suspicion. Contracting Covid-19 does not mean someone has less value than anyone else.\n\nThe migrant worker community, for example, despite their obvious vulnerability and lack of adequate efforts to protect them, has been unfairly blamed for the outbreak, especially in the third wave.\n\nThirdly, a lesson learnt from people living with HIV is that: \u201cIf you take away our jobs, you will kill us faster than the virus.\u201d\n\nIn our response to dealing with Covid-19, we need to also protect jobs and people\u2019s livelihoods. Covid-19 and the resulting lockdowns have caused tremendous and unprecedented economic turmoil and impacted thousands of households.\n\nDue to lockdowns and closure of economic activities, it has deprived people of livelihoods and caused many families to slip closer towards or deeper into poverty. It is essential that those affected by Covid-19 face no stigma in returning to their jobs. Workers should not fear that they might lose their jobs if they test positive for Covid-19.\n\nPunitive laws do not work\n\nFinally, a key lesson from the HIV response is that exclusion and punitive laws do not work.\n\nEvery day, from the start of the first movement control order, we have heard how many people have been fined or arrested for SOP violations. Rather than contribute towards reductions in the number of people being infected with Covid-19, what it has achieved instead, is create an atmosphere of fear and resentment towards authorities especially with the appearance of double standards.\n\nMany, particularly those from lower income backgrounds have become victims of subjective enforcement.\n\nWith the number of new Covid-19 cases reaching record numbers, this emphasis on a punitive approach to disease prevention and control should be reviewed.\n\nThis is a public health emergency, not a war. There are no winners or losers, good sides or bad sides.\n\nIn this public health crisis, we need to look to our common humanity. Anyone can get infected during this global pandemic. Covid-19 does not discriminate, and neither should our response.\n\nWe should treat the individuals and communities affected by Covid-19 the same way how we would wish ourselves to be treated, with empathy and compassion. Government, community leaders and public health officials can lead by example and help prevent stigma and discrimination.\n\nNo one is safe until we are all safe, and stopping stigma is critical to making our communities safer and healthier. We need to work together to prevent and address stigma.\n\nAzrul Mohd Khalib is the head of Galen Centre for Health & Social Policy and is an FMT reader.\n\nThe views expressed are those of the writer

The next few years will decide whether Samsung will become, say, a global platform company or remain a hardware company,\u201d he said.\n\nLee, 52, has been the de facto head of Samsung Electronics since his father, Lee Kun-hee, was hospitalised after a heart attack in 2014.\n\nThe elder Lee died in October, but the chairmanship he held has yet to be filled, and uncertainty cast by his son\u2019s legal troubles was the chief reason, analysts said.\n\nVice-chairman since 2012, Lee has yet to make a mark \u2013 as his father did \u2013 by building the semiconductor business, which now brings in half of Samsung Electronics profits.\n\nAmid the moves meant to ensure his succession, Lee has fought against allegations of legal wrongdoing, including a year in prison in 2017-2018 over a bribery case involving impeached President Park Geun-hye.\n\nFlagship businesses\n\nOne of Lee\u2019s focuses is Samsung\u2019s non-memory chip business, including chip contract manufacturing, calling on the staff to \u201ccreate another legend\u201d.\n\nSamsung plans to invest US$121.47 billion in non-memory chips through 2030 to become No 1, including in chip contract manufacturing, where its 17% market share is a distant second to current No 1 TSMC\u2019s 54%, according to TrendForce.\n\nSamsung has also touted Lee\u2019s deal-making skills in winning a US$6.6 billion contract from Verizon last year, describing the network equipment business \u2013 still small compared with that of rivals like Huawei \u2013 as a key business area.\n\nLee also needs to deal with paying inheritance tax to maintain control of the tech giant. Since Lee Kun-hee passed away, an estimated US$10.05 billion in inheritance tax is expected to be needed for his family to inherit his listed stockholdings alone.\n\nAnd he faces a separate trial over suspected accounting fraud and stock price manipulation connected to a 2015 merger that helped him assume greater control of Samsung Electronics.\n\nSuper-class company\n\nUrbane, reserved and media-shy, Lee has shown a relaxed side in public more recently after his release from detention.\n\nHe has been pictured eating lunch in staff cafeterias, taking selfies with employees, and smiling brightly when President Moon Jae-in visited a Samsung worksite in April 2019.\n\nIn May, he said he would not hand over management rights to his children and apologised for the behaviour of executives caught sabotaging labour union activities.\n\n\u201cA true super-class company is a sustainable company \u2026 I want to make a new Samsung,\u201d Lee said during his final statement to the court in December.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["business", "legal", "company", "lee", "manufacturing", "stepping", "samsung", "jaeyong", "shadow", "samsungs", "contract", "electronics", "cusp", "including", "chip", "fathers"], "summary": "SEOUL: For years, legal troubles have cast a cloud over Samsung Electronics Vice-Chairman Lee Jae-yong as he stood on the cusp of stepping out of his father\u2019s shadow and making a name for himself as the leader of the global tech giant.\nLee, 52, has been the de facto head of Samsung Electronics since his father, Lee Kun-hee, was hospitalised after a heart attack in 2014.\nFlagship businessesOne of Lee\u2019s focuses is Samsung\u2019s non-memory chip business, including chip contract manufacturing, calling on the staff to \u201ccreate another legend\u201d.\nAnd he faces a separate trial over suspected accounting fraud and stock price manipulation connected to a 2015 merger that helped him assume greater control of Samsung Electronics.\n\u201cA true super-class company is a sustainable company \u2026 I want to make a new Samsung,\u201d Lee said during his final statement to the court in December.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-01-17 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Insurance companies seeking ways to ease patients\u2019 expenses", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wMS8xNy9pbnN1cmFuY2UtY29tcGFuaWVzLXNlZWtpbmctd2F5cy10by1lYXNlLXBhdGllbnRzLWV4cGVuc2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/admission-registration-counter-sunway-medical-fb.jpg", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: Insurance and takaful companies said today they are working with the health ministry and Bank Negara Malaysia to explore ways to ease some of the expenses of Covid-19 patients who are treated in private hospitals.\n\nIn a joint statement, the Life Insurance Association of Malaysia, General Insurance Association of Malaysia and Malaysian Takaful Association said pandemic-related risks are generally not covered under any insurance and takaful plans worldwide.\n\n\u201cThe exclusion stems from the difficulty in pricing for coverage relating to an event like a pandemic that may occur once in a lifetime, having an incalculable impact and cost.

20 \u2014 Vegetable prices in Melaka have increased by 20 to 70 per cent this week due to low supplies said Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) Melaka branch director Norena Jaafar.\n\nShe said most of the vegetables supplied to supermarkets and traders in the state are from Pasar Selayang in Kuala Lumpur but their stocks were not replenished since the vegetable section of the wholesale market was ordered to close from Monday to Friday this week, after Covid-19 cases were detected in the market.\n\n\u201cMelaka KPDNHEP is trying to get supplies from Cameron Highlands, Pahang but the flood situation there has not improved and this has hampered our efforts,\u201d she said when contacted by Bernama here today.\n\nNorena said apart from Cameron Highlands the agency would also try to get supplies of organic vegetables from farmers in Melaka, but they would cost more adding that consumers avoid buying organic vegetables as they were expensive.\n\nMeanwhile she said with more people staying home due to the movement control order (MCO) more people are spending time to cook and this has affected the supply of cooking oil, especially the one-kilogram packets.\n\n\u201cAs such we will limit sale of the 1kg cooking oil packets to three packets per customer, while waiting for the flood situation in Pahang to improve, as supplies of cooking oil in the state are mostly from Pahang,\u201d she said.\n\nIn addition, she said KPDNHEP would find the best way to solve the vegetable and cooking oil shortage in the state ahead of the Chinese New Year celebration next month.\n\nLast Monday, a news portal reported over 90 Covid-19 positive cases were detected in the Selayang Wholesale Market which led to its closure for four days from last Monday,

has been streamlined even further to specific services, after more than a week of the movement control order (MCO) this year.\n\nThe latest update of the MCO regulations gazetted on January 21 and published on the Federal Government Gazette\u2019s website lists 52 items under essential services, instead of 50 items in the January 15 gazette.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s what has changed in the latest list of essential services that can operate during MCO 2.0:\n\nInternet, postal, courier, broadcasting, call centre now specified\n\nIn the January 15 list (old), telecommunications and information technology were grouped together as item 28, but this category of services has been made more detailed in the latest January 21 list (new) by splitting them into item 28 and item 29 and adding new specific services such as call centres and internet services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOld: 28. Telecommunication and digital infrastructures including information and communication technology services and global business services\n\nNew: 28. Communications including telecommunications and internet, postal and courier, and broadcasting\n\n29. Information technology including global business services and call centre\n\nSlight change for e-commerce detail\n\nThe new list includes a slight tweak to the old list in the e-commerce item.\n\nOld: 29. E-commerce including e-marketplace, digital payment and local e-commerce internet centre services\n\nNew: 30: E-commerce including e-marketplace, digital payment and local e-commerce services centre\n\nNew category added on\n\nThis item was not mentioned in the old list.\n\nNew: 31. Digital creative content development in studio including film editing\n\nBoth the old and new lists contain a catch-all phrase of \u201cAny service, work, industry of business as determined by the Minister of Health after consulting the authority that regulates the services, work, industry and business\u201d, which essentially means that any businesses not included in the gazetted list of essential services may still be allowed to operate if the health minister decides that they can operate.\n\nThe new gazetted list takes effect on January 22, and applies to the whole of Malaysia except Sarawak \u2014 Johor, Kedah, Kelantan, Melaka, Negri Sembilan, Pahang, Penang, Perak, Perlis, Sabah, Selangor, Terengganu, Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya, Labuan \u2014 until February 2 which is when MCO is due to end. The new list also applies to Sibu in Sarawak where the MCO is scheduled to end January 29.\n\nThis is not the first time that the government has made changes to the list of essential services allowed to operate during MCO 2.0.\n\nThe Ministry of International Trade and Industry had on January 12 afternoon released a list of essential services for MCO 2.0 that included automotive manufacturing and after-sales services, but updated the list the same evening by removing that exemption and only listing automotive repair and maintenance as an essential service.\n\nThe government in MCO regulations gazetted on January 12 listed the manufacturing and production of \u201cautomotive equipment\u201d as an essential service but did not include automotive repair and maintenance.\n\nThe January 15 gazetted list of essential services updated this to be the manufacturing and production of \u201cautomotive (vehicles and components)\u201d instead of the \u201cautomotive equipment\u201d previously listed, while also adding \u201cautomotive (maintenance and repair)\u201d as a separate business under the services category that is allowed to continue to operate.\n\nThe changes in the list of essential services had resulted in carmakers Hondo, Toyota and Perodua briefly stopping activities in their factories in Malaysia, before resuming operations again.\n\nWhere to get the latest information\n\nIf you are a business owner and want to know about the latest rules, guidelines, standard operating procedures or frequently-asked questions issued by Miti, there is a dedicated section on the ministry\u2019s website with such MCO-related information (https://www.miti.gov.my/redir/pkp/pkp.html).\n\nHowever when Malay Mail visited the Miti website section dedicated to MCO information at around noon on Thursday, various editions \u2014 both old and new \u2014 of the list of essential services were found on the website.\n\nThis dedicated section has six sections: Media release, FAQs, SOPs and gazette, infographic, CIMS 3.0 tutorial video, and email enquiry.\n\nThe FAQ document in the FAQ section which was issued on January 12 by Miti in Bahasa Malaysia, comes with a list of essential services written in Bahasa Malaysia dated January 12.\n\nIn the media release section, a media release in English and issued on January 12 comes with a list of essential services written in English which was updated as of January 16 and sourced from the January 15 gazetted list.\n\nThe infographics section of the site carries two sets of slides or infographics \u2014 one in Bahasa Malaysia and another in English \u2014 on the list of essential services, with this based also on the January 15 gazetted list.\n\nAlso included in the infographics section is a set of slides dated January 20 of the list of 16 businesses allowed by the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) to operate during the MCO, with this list written in Bahasa Malaysia: Shopping complexes or malls, supermarkets and hypermarkets, departmental stores, pharmacies or selling of personal care products, convenience stores or mini marts, laundry shops (not including self-service laundromats), restaurants, furniture stores, jewellery shops, electrics and electronics stores, bookshops and stationery shops, hardware stores, pet food, vehicle workshops or maintenance or spare parts, vehicle sales and distribution centres, speciality retail stores at petrol stations.\n\n(On January 12, senior minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob when announcing the government\u2019s rules for areas under MCO had said that laundry shops except for self-service laundromats will be allowed to operate from 6am to 8pm. Following public complaints, Ismail Sabri however on January 14 said self-service laundromats will also be allowed to operate during MCO, with the condition that a worker is present to ensure physical distancing and check customers\u2019 body temperature. Although optometrists were not included in KPDNHEP\u2019s initial list, the government on January 15 confirmed that they were now allowed by the KPDNHEP to open during MCO based on tighter SOPs.)\n\nIn the SOPs and gazette section on Miti\u2019s MCO site, clicking on the federal gazette would lead to the latest January 21 government gazette containing the latest list of essential services, while the SOPs posted is also the latest National Security Council\u2019s general SOPs for MCO areas which is dated January 21.\n\nAs of noon yesterday, Miti\u2019s Facebook and Twitter accounts have yet to post information regarding the updated details in the gazetted list of essential services allowed to operate.\n\nAs for Sarawak (except for Sibu) which is under the conditional movement control order (CMCO) until January 31, the latest CMCO regulations gazetted by the federal government on January 21 maintains the list of prohibited activities that had been in use in previous editions of CMCO rules.\n\nThe list of prohibited activities under CMCO are: Outbound tour activities by Malaysians and inbound tour activities involving foreign tourists except foreign tourists from countries specified by the health minister, activities in pubs and nightclubs except for restaurant business in pubs and nightclubs, and any activity with many people attending at a place which makes it difficult to carry out physical distancing and to comply with the health director-general\u2019s directions. \u2015 Malay Mail\n\nRelated reading", "keyword": ["operate",

It is still being reviewed,\u201d he said.\n\nBased on social media postings and a quick survey done by The Malaysian Reserve (TMR), many are of the opinion that the shorter operating hours of eateries during the MCO has increased the burden of the rakyat.\n\nRestoran Mahsuri owner Afnan Aiman said the move to allow businesses, eateries and shops to only operate from 6am to 8pm has caused more hardship to the rakyat, instead of helping them.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s not okay. Businesses have been a little slow because now we can\u2019t dine in and time is too limited because people would usually finish work at 6pm or much later, and by the time they reach home, there\u2019s not enough time to buy food because we\u2019re already closed.\n\n\u201cWhen this happens, it affects our businesses and sales have been shrinking,\u201d he told TMR.\n\nHe said if operating hours can be extended until 10pm, all restaurant operators will feel a little relieved and satisfied because most of them have more sales at night.\n\n\u201cAny restaurant, they depend more on customers who come at night. If the government is willing to extend the time, 10pm is already okay for us.\u201d\n\nAfnan also opined that the country\u2019s political instability has put a great weight on businesses, making people\u2019s lives more difficult than it already is.\n\n\u201cWe know Covid-19 is dangerous, why would the politicians want to take advantage at a time like this by holding elections and asking people to choose leaders?\n\n\u201cTo me, all of that is unnecessary. They should solve this problem first before their politics. If they can\u2019t help us, don\u2019t help us.\u201d\n\nKedai Kopi Payung owner Nor Baizura Jamil told TMR the operating hours were pleasant at first as it gives time for her to close shop early and rest.\n\n\u201cBut from an economic standpoint, sales have been down to half of what we made before. We have experienced a lot of our customers trying to come and buy food around 6pm or before we close.\u201d\n\nShe also believes that it is better to extend the operating hours so that businesses can run accordingly to reach its sales targets and customers will not feel distressed.\n\nThe situation has caused quite the stir on Twitter when the hashtag #SiBodohKauDengarSini, which translates to \u201cListen here, idiot\u201d, became a trending topic recently.\n\nIt all started when user @farhanazahan complained about not having dinner two nights in a row and that he faced problems while ordering food even though he placed an early order at 5pm.\n\nHe also tweeted that compared to Ismail Sabri, he does not have a maid to serve food at home when he gets back from work.\n\nAnother user @puterirajaawan replied that she \u201cdoes not understand people who create problems out of everything\u201d.\n\nShe suggested ordering the food early to store it in the fridge and reheat it the next day.\n\nThis elicited a response from @yarafaee_ whose tweet started with \u201cSi bodoh, kau dengar sini\u201d before elaborating that food delivery platforms are facing technical problems to fulfil substantial orders during a short window.\n\n\u201cPeople who got back from work do not have time to cook because they have to get up early the next day to go back to work.\u201d\n\nShe also tweeted \u201cinstead of telling the rakyat to find a way, why not ask the government to extend operating hours?\u201d", "keyword": ["govt", "problems", "hours", "early", "closing", "8pm", "instead", "short", "extend", "operating", "reconsiders", "sales", "food", "businesses"], "summary": "Based on social media postings and a quick survey done by The Malaysian Reserve (TMR), many are of the opinion that the shorter operating hours of eateries during the MCO has increased the burden of the rakyat.\nRestoran Mahsuri owner Afnan Aiman said the move to allow businesses, eateries and shops to only operate from 6am to 8pm has caused more hardship to the rakyat, instead of helping them.\n\u201cWhen this happens, it affects our businesses and sales have been shrinking,\u201d he told TMR.\nHe said if operating hours can be extended until 10pm, all restaurant operators will feel a little relieved and satisfied because most of them have more sales at night.\nShe suggested ordering the food early to store it in the fridge and reheat it the next day.", "news": "The Malaysian Reserve", "date": "2021-01-20 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Kapayan rep urges state government to expedite aid efforts to flood victims in Penampang", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVib3JuZW9wb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzAxLzE3L2thcGF5YW4tcmVwLXVyZ2VzLXN0YXRlLWdvdmVybm1lbnQtdG8tZXhwZWRpdGUtYWlkLWVmZm9ydHMtdG8tZmxvb2QtdmljdGltcy1pbi1wZW5hbXBhbmcv0gEA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2021/01/WhatsApp-Image-2021-01-17-at-13.02.58.jpeg", "text": "KOTA KINABALU (Jan 17): Kapayan assemblywoman Jannie Lasimbang urges the Gabungan Rakyat Sabah (GRS) state government to expedite efforts to send assistance to those affected by the flood in Penampang and other districts.\n\nJannie also urged the government to continue to source for funds for the flood mitigation project in Penampang.\n\nJannie in a statement today said she was saddened to see Donggongon township and surrounding villages like Kampung Hungab, Kampung Tunoh, Bundusan as well as a few housing estates there flooded again.\n\n\u201cDuring my time in government, I have tried to find a solution to the flooding problem.

Here, crop losses have been unavoidable as many sections of the fields have been under 2ft to 3ft of water for two to three weeks,\u201d said Carl Bek-Nielsen, chief executive (CEO) of United Plantations Bhd.\n\n\u201cThis adversely affects the ability to enter the fields and harvest the crop, let alone bring out the crop as fields are under water.\u201d\n\nIn Sarawak, Malaysia\u2019s second-biggest palm growing state, the drop in yields may be more severe than the 15% to 20% initially estimated over the next two months, according to Andrew Cheng, CEO of the Sarawak Oil Palm Plantation Owners Association.\n\nThat is because the acute worker shortage compounds production problems caused by floodwaters which have inundated plantations and interrupted harvesting, he said.\n\n\u201cI believe many oil palm plantations in Sarawak\u2019s lower-lying areas will be affected, especially with the King Tide coming in,\u201d Cheng said, referring to an especially high tide, which may lead to prolonged flooding.\n\n\u201cDue to the Covid-19 pandemic and the movement control order, we are unable to assess the overall situation.\u201d Sarawak makes up about 21% of the country\u2019s total palm oil output.\n\nBreaking point\n\nMalaysia\u2019s shortage of palm oil workers has become \u201cmuch, much worse\u201d compared with six months ago, and was likely responsible for up to 90% of the 3.6 million tonnes of fresh fruit bunches lost last year, Bek-Nielsen said.\n\n\u201cWe are at a breaking point that will result in considerable crop losses in 2021,\u201d he said. While first quarter production will not be much lower than last quarter, the impact from the acute labour shortage \u201cwill really start to bite and impact production from April to October\u201d, leading to a drop in output this year to 18.6 million tonnes. Output was 19.14 million tonnes in 2020.\n\nTo relieve the shortage of foreign workers, planters are seeking government approval for a safe way to bring guest workers into Malaysia, where all Covid-19 testing and quarantine costs are borne by employers, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, FGV Holdings Bhd, one of the country\u2019s biggest producers, said about 3,600ha in Pahang, Johor, Perak, Negeri Sembilan and Sabah were affected by flash floods, although there is no serious impact to field operations and mills are running as usual despite a drop in daily volumes.\n\nStill, there will be a \u201cslight impact on yield production due to weather affecting labour productivity in January and in the first quarter\u201d, it said in emailed responses. \u201cWe estimate the potential reduction in yields to be about 20% for January as compared with the earlier month, and by almost 20% in 1Q from the earlier period.\u201d\n\nIn Indonesia, the world\u2019s top producer, plantations have not been affected by the recent flooding in South Kalimantan, according to the Indonesian Palm Oil Association, or Gapki.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["oil", "labour", "crop", "whammy", "double", "floods", "output",

EU-Malaysia Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Eurocham Malaysia) via Malay Mail\n\nAll Malaysian states (except Sarawak) are currently under Movement Control Order (MCO) until 4th February.\n\nMOH predicts 5,000 daily new infections the week after Chinese New Year\n\nHealth Director-General Tan Sri Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah released data showing the infection rate of Covid-19 or (R0/ Rt) as of 22nd January at 1.09.\n\nBut if the R0 increases to 1.2, MOH forecasts 5,000 daily new cases in the third week of February, followed by 8,000 daily new cases in the third week of March.\n\nThe third week of February coincides with the end of Chinese New Year, but the occasion is unlikely to affect the case numbers as interstate travel and social gatherings are currently banned.\n\nKadar kebolehjangkitan Covid-19 atau Ro/Rt pada jangkaan mengikut kes seharian pada 22 Januari 2021 untuk seluruh negara adalah 1.09.

Government buses leave daily from Shimla to Kalpa, so that can be your budget option.\n\nIf you want comfort, then you can hire a chauffeur-driven car instead. Another alternative is to rent a car from Chandigarh and drive yourself.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nKalpa has a few hotels and many homestay options, such as the Fort-View Homestay and The Village View Homestay.\n\nBoth were very nice and cosy experiences with wonderful views, so do choose whichever suits you.\n\nWhere to eat\n\nThere are no good restaurants, although you can try dining in at Echor. There are two or three restaurants here that are, frankly, quite expensive yet not up to the mark.\n\nThat being said, your best bet will be to eat at your homestay or hotel restaurant.\n\nThings to do\n\nYou can explore all the nooks and corners of this small town within two whole days as Kalpa is a small village with few things to do.\n\nHowever, don\u2019t let that stop you from enjoying the atmosphere and the mood.\n\nHere are some places you can visit:\n\nChandalika Temple\n\nChandalika Devi temple is done in beautiful Himachali architecture and offers a gorgeous view of Kinnau Kailash at sunrise.\n\nKalpa Monastery\n\nOne must visit this peaceful Buddhist monastery at Kalpa. The chants in the evenings and mornings add to the ambiance of this town.\n\nSuicide Point\n\nSuicide Point is 5km away from the town, so if you\u2019re looking for that perfect cliffside Instagram picture, this is the place for it.\n\nVillage tour\n\nKalpa is a self-sustaining village with a lot of organic farming activity going on. You can take a stroll to the farm or visit the old heritage houses in and around the village.\n\nApple Orchard tour\n\nKalpa has many apple orchards and if you are visiting during the harvest season, which is around August or October, be sure to visit them.\n\nAmit and Anindita are Indian Travel bloggers who blog at Travel Like We Do.

Azrul Mohd Khalib\n\nThere is an alarming emerging trend of resident associations and condominium managements requiring the disclosure of confidential medical information related to the Covid-19 status of people living in their neighbourhood.\n\nThere are demands for PCR or antigen test results, copies of passports and pictures of those who are positive. Most are aimed at foreigners. Residents are encouraged to inform on their neighbours. All being done supposedly in the name of collective protection, safety, and security.\n\nThis is a challenging and uncertain time for everyone.\n\nWith daily new Covid-19 numbers reaching record numbers, no peak in sight to the third wave, and more people in our communities, workplaces and families becoming infected, it is natural that we become increasingly fearful and insecure, not just for ourselves but also our loved ones.\n\nThe threat of death and disease, coupled with the general lack of knowledge of how Covid-19 spreads, and the need to blame someone for the pain and suffering that we see among those infected and affected, have led to a cloud of stigma.\n\nStigma now surrounds Covid-19, the people and communities who have contracted the disease. It is causing prejudice, discrimination, and xenophobia, widening inequalities, increasing vulnerabilities to violence, harassment and ostracisation, and hampering public health measures intended to manage the epidemic.\n\nThere are increasing reports of people and families who have recovered from infection or been released from home isolation or quarantine, being marginalised, or ostracised by their neighbours, family members, communities, and even loved ones, resulting in additional anxiety, and falling into depression.\n\nPeople have been blamed for supposedly bringing Covid-19 into housing areas and condominium complexes. Fingers were pointed at migrant workers when they were disproportionately represented in the daily statistics, which led to crackdowns by authorities, and caused fear and anxiety among even documented foreigners.\n\nFormer patients have lost jobs after their recovery. Families have been told to leave their rented homes. Tragically, out of a sense of overwhelming shame and fear of being a burden to their loved ones, some patients have recently taken their own lives. The list of consequences due to Covid-19-related stigma goes on.\n\nAll around the world, for those who have worked on AIDS for the past four decades, this sounds altogether too familiar. The same challenges, problems and harm of stigma and discrimination seen in that epidemic are manifesting themselves in the Covid-19 pandemic. But amid the ongoing tragedy, there is an opportunity.\n\nWe can apply what we have learnt from 40 years of the HIV-AIDS epidemic to what is happening today, in order to address the Covid-19 stigma. We do not need to repeat the same mistakes. We should not lose more lives through abuse, harm and suffering caused by Covid-19 prejudice and discrimination.\n\nIn our fear and frustration, we must resist adopting draconian measures that degrade or compromise on human rights and dignity.\n\nPast successful responses to public health emergencies have demonstrated repeatedly the value of grounding them in human rights.\n\nWe have learnt the hard way from the HIV-AIDS epidemic, that approaches which depend on punitive measures, shaming and discrimination undermine public health objectives and eventually fail in the long run. They end up doing more harm than good.\n\nSolidarity, empathy, and compassion reduce suffering, protect public health and save lives.\n\nNew Zealand has shown that when empathy and compassion are coupled with competence and firmness, the Covid-19 outbreak can be managed effectively and decisively.\n\nHumanise Covid-19 pandemic\n\nTo address Covid-19 stigma, we can do better in four areas.\n\nFirstly, we must humanise the Covid-19 pandemic. Today, the people and lives who have been touched by this disease are almost entirely represented by the health ministry\u2019s daily reported numbers of those infected, recovered, needing intensive care, placed on ventilator support, and who have died.\n\nThe human face of Malaysia\u2019s response to the outbreak is largely missing from these statistics.\n\nAside from what is shared online in social media, there are barely any stories in the mainstream media of people and their lived experiences of being infected and surviving, of the lives that have been lost. This has contributed to the fear, misinformation and stigma surrounding Covid-19.\n\nThe right to confidentiality and privacy of medical information should be protected. However, there are many who are willing and have volunteered to share their experiences, as patients, caregivers, emergency services and healthcare workers.\n\nGiving an opportunity for stories to be broadcast, especially those that are positive and uplifting, will go a long way in dealing with the ignorance and misunderstanding surrounding the disease and towards building a Covid-19 response that is free from stigma and discrimination.\n\nHealthcare workers, who have been at the forefront of the response to this public health emergency for a year now, have resorted to either posting on social media or covertly sharing their pain, suffering and frustrations with trusted media outlets.\n\nMany hope that by doing so, they would inform the public about what is happening in our hospitals and healthcare facilities, the day-to-day realities, and possibly gain public support and empathy.\n\nThe fact that they are forced to do so, often in a discreet manner largely to protect themselves from official repercussions, is a disservice to the sacrifices that they and their families have made. They should not have to do this. We need to highlight their stories in the media, listen to their appeals and respond to their requests for assistance.\n\nSecondly, we need to correct negative language that can fuel fear and stigma. We must avoid the use of stereotypical, negative expressions that can create or increase stigma, and focus on inclusive language.\n\nCommunities at risk or vulnerable to Covid-19 infection have been described as time bombs, fuelling fear and suspicion. Contracting Covid-19 does not mean someone has less value than anyone else.\n\nThe migrant worker community, for example, despite their obvious vulnerability and lack of adequate efforts to protect them, has been unfairly blamed for the outbreak, especially in the third wave.\n\nThirdly, a lesson learnt from people living with HIV is that: \u201cIf you take away our jobs, you will kill us faster than the virus.\u201d\n\nIn our response to dealing with Covid-19, we need to also protect jobs and people\u2019s livelihoods. Covid-19 and the resulting lockdowns have caused tremendous and unprecedented economic turmoil and impacted thousands of households.\n\nDue to lockdowns and closure of economic activities, it has deprived people of livelihoods and caused many families to slip closer towards or deeper into poverty. It is essential that those affected by Covid-19 face no stigma in returning to their jobs. Workers should not fear that they might lose their jobs if they test positive for Covid-19.\n\nPunitive laws do not work\n\nFinally, a key lesson from the HIV response is that exclusion and punitive laws do not work.\n\nEvery day, from the start of the first movement control order, we have heard how many people have been fined or arrested for SOP violations. Rather than contribute towards reductions in the number of people being infected with Covid-19, what it has achieved instead, is create an atmosphere of fear and resentment towards authorities especially with the appearance of double standards.\n\nMany, particularly those from lower income backgrounds have become victims of subjective enforcement.\n\nWith the number of new Covid-19 cases reaching record numbers, this emphasis on a punitive approach to disease prevention and control should be reviewed.\n\nThis is a public health emergency, not a war. There are no winners or losers, good sides or bad sides.\n\nIn this public health crisis, we need to look to our common humanity. Anyone can get infected during this global pandemic. Covid-19 does not discriminate, and neither should our response.\n\nWe should treat the individuals and communities affected by Covid-19 the same way how we would wish ourselves to be treated, with empathy and compassion. Government, community leaders and public health officials can lead by example and help prevent stigma and discrimination.\n\nNo one is safe until we are all safe, and stopping stigma is critical to making our communities safer and healthier. We need to work together to prevent and address stigma.\n\nAzrul Mohd Khalib is the head of Galen Centre for Health & Social Policy and is an FMT reader.\n\nThe views expressed are those of the writer

published on the Federal Government Gazette\u2019s website lists 52 items under essential services, instead of 50 items in the January 15 gazette.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s what has changed in the latest list of essential services that can operate during MCO 2.0:\n\nInternet, postal, courier, broadcasting, call centre now specified\n\nIn the January 15 list (old), telecommunications and information technology were grouped together as item 28, but this category of services has been made more detailed in the latest January 21 list (new) by splitting them into item 28 and item 29 and adding new specific services such as call centres and internet services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOld: 28. Telecommunication and digital infrastructures including information and communication technology services and global business services\n\nNew: 28. Communications including telecommunications and internet, postal and courier, and broadcasting\n\n29. Information technology including global business services and call centre\n\nSlight change for e-commerce detail\n\nThe new list includes a slight tweak to the old list in the e-commerce item.\n\nOld: 29. E-commerce including e-marketplace, digital payment and local e-commerce internet centre services\n\nNew: 30: E-commerce including e-marketplace, digital payment and local e-commerce services centre\n\nNew category added on\n\nThis item was not mentioned in the old list.\n\nNew: 31. Digital creative content development in studio including film editing\n\nBoth the old and new lists contain a catch-all phrase of \u201cAny service, work, industry of business as determined by the Minister of Health after consulting the authority that regulates the services, work, industry and business\u201d, which essentially means that any businesses not included in the gazetted list of essential services may still be allowed to operate if the health minister decides that they can operate.\n\nThe new gazetted list takes effect on January 22, and applies to the whole of Malaysia except Sarawak \u2014 Johor, Kedah, Kelantan, Melaka, Negri Sembilan, Pahang, Penang, Perak, Perlis, Sabah, Selangor, Terengganu, Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya, Labuan \u2014 until February 2 which is when MCO is due to end. The new list also applies to Sibu in Sarawak where the MCO is scheduled to end January 29.\n\nThis is not the first time that the government has made changes to the list of essential services allowed to operate during MCO 2.0.\n\nThe Ministry of International Trade and Industry had on January 12 afternoon released a list of essential services for MCO 2.0 that included automotive manufacturing and after-sales services, but updated the list the same evening by removing that exemption and only listing automotive repair and maintenance as an essential service.\n\nThe government in MCO regulations gazetted on January 12 listed the manufacturing and production of \u201cautomotive equipment\u201d as an essential service but did not include automotive repair and maintenance.\n\nThe January 15 gazetted list of essential services updated this to be the manufacturing and production of \u201cautomotive (vehicles and components)\u201d instead of the \u201cautomotive equipment\u201d previously listed, while also adding \u201cautomotive (maintenance and repair)\u201d as a separate business under the services category that is allowed to continue to operate.\n\nThe changes in the list of essential services had resulted in carmakers Hondo, Toyota and Perodua briefly stopping activities in their factories in Malaysia, before resuming operations again.\n\nWhere to get the latest information\n\nIf you are a business owner and want to know about the latest rules, guidelines, standard operating procedures or frequently-asked questions issued by Miti, there is a dedicated section on the ministry\u2019s website with such MCO-related information (https://www.miti.gov.my/redir/pkp/pkp.html).\n\nHowever when Malay Mail visited the Miti website section dedicated to MCO information at around noon on Thursday, various editions \u2014 both old and new \u2014 of the list of essential services were found on the website.\n\nThis dedicated section has six sections: Media release, FAQs, SOPs and gazette, infographic, CIMS 3.0 tutorial video, and email enquiry.\n\nThe FAQ document in the FAQ section which was issued on January 12 by Miti in Bahasa Malaysia, comes with a list of essential services written in Bahasa Malaysia dated January 12.\n\nIn the media release section, a media release in English and issued on January 12 comes with a list of essential services written in English which was updated as of January 16 and sourced from the January 15 gazetted list.\n\nThe infographics section of the site carries two sets of slides or infographics \u2014 one in Bahasa Malaysia and another in English \u2014 on the list of essential services, with this based also on the January 15 gazetted list.\n\nAlso included in the infographics section is a set of slides dated January 20 of the list of 16 businesses allowed by the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) to operate during the MCO, with this list written in Bahasa Malaysia: Shopping complexes or malls, supermarkets and hypermarkets, departmental stores, pharmacies or selling of personal care products, convenience stores or mini marts, laundry shops (not including self-service laundromats), restaurants, furniture stores, jewellery shops, electrics and electronics stores, bookshops and stationery shops, hardware stores, pet food, vehicle workshops or maintenance or spare parts, vehicle sales and distribution centres, speciality retail stores at petrol stations.\n\n(On January 12, senior minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob when announcing the government\u2019s rules for areas under MCO had said that laundry shops except for self-service laundromats will be allowed to operate from 6am to 8pm. Following public complaints, Ismail Sabri however on January 14 said self-service laundromats will also be allowed to operate during MCO, with the condition that a worker is present to ensure physical distancing and check customers\u2019 body temperature. Although optometrists were not included in KPDNHEP\u2019s initial list, the government on January 15 confirmed that they were now allowed by the KPDNHEP to open during MCO based on tighter SOPs.)\n\nIn the SOPs and gazette section on Miti\u2019s MCO site, clicking on the federal gazette would lead to the latest January 21 government gazette containing the latest list of essential services, while the SOPs posted is also the latest National Security Council\u2019s general SOPs for MCO areas which is dated January 21.\n\nAs of noon yesterday, Miti\u2019s Facebook and Twitter accounts have yet to post information regarding the updated details in the gazetted list of essential services allowed to operate.\n\nAs for Sarawak (except for Sibu) which is under the conditional movement control order (CMCO) until January 31, the latest CMCO regulations gazetted by the federal government on January 21 maintains the list of prohibited activities that had been in use in previous editions of CMCO rules.\n\nThe list of prohibited activities under CMCO are: Outbound tour activities by Malaysians and inbound tour activities involving foreign tourists except foreign tourists from countries specified by the health minister, activities in pubs and nightclubs except for restaurant business in pubs and nightclubs, and any activity with many people attending at a place which makes it difficult to carry out physical distancing and to comply with the health director-general\u2019s directions. \u2015 Malay Mail\n\nRelated reading", "keyword": ["operate",

We didn\u2019t really know where we were. We just wanted to run away,\u201d Diana tells FMT, recounting the horrific day.\n\nDiana and Dorothy had spent nearly all their lives in a children\u2019s home in Buntong, but after being caught recording the bullying and emotional abuse kids at the home faced, they had been sent away.\n\nThe girls said the home\u2019s caretaker sent them away at night to \u201clive with their father\u201d, a person they\u2019ve never even met, in a shack in a rural village in Batu Gajah.\n\nAt the house, they said, bottles of cheap liquor were strewn on the floor, and Diana says the man they were told was their father was drunk and slurring. Another foreign couple lived in the house too.\n\nFortunately, nothing untoward happened that night. The next day, the two girls told their \u201cfather\u201d they were going to a nearby sundry shop and ran off to tell passers-by of their plight. They were put in touch with an NGO that helped people in distress.\n\nThe NGO called Persatuan Harapan India Malaysia came to the girls\u2019 rescue after being told of their ordeal, and the plight others faced at the children\u2019s home.\n\nM Manimaran, the group\u2019s president, said he was shocked to hear what was happening in the children\u2019s home, and since then, has managed to rescue six children and placed them in another home.\n\nFMT is withholding the name of the home pending a comment from its management.\n\nManimaran has also lodged a police report and filed a complaint with the Welfare Department.\n\nDiana says children at the home are often bullied and scolded by the caretakers.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of kind people who donate things to the home, but these items get taken away. We are also threatened against speaking about what happens at the home.\u201d\n\nThey claimed the children are also being given Christian names and are forced to attend activities at a church.\n\nA pair of sisters rescued from the home, Salvander Kaur Vikram Singh, 17 and Elvina Kaur, 14, also spoke of their traumatic experiences at the home.\n\nThe girls from Johor were sent to the children\u2019s home as their parents could not afford to provide them a good education.\n\n\u201cMy sister and I were threatened that if we did not obey (what the caretakers demanded), they would cut our hair short.\u201d Sikh men and women do not cut their hair, as part of their practice.\n\n\u201cThey forced us to go to church and pray. If we refused, they would threaten to call our parents. There are times our parents did call but they could not speak to us because they were told we were busy studying or not around, when in fact we were there.\u201d\n\nElvina actually had her hair cut short as punishment for refusing to listen to a caretaker\u2019s demands.\n\n\u201cNow my sister and I are no longer there, we are happy.

It is still being reviewed,\u201d he said.\n\nBased on social media postings and a quick survey done by The Malaysian Reserve (TMR), many are of the opinion that the shorter operating hours of eateries during the MCO has increased the burden of the rakyat.\n\nRestoran Mahsuri owner Afnan Aiman said the move to allow businesses, eateries and shops to only operate from 6am to 8pm has caused more hardship to the rakyat, instead of helping them.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s not okay. Businesses have been a little slow because now we can\u2019t dine in and time is too limited because people would usually finish work at 6pm or much later, and by the time they reach home, there\u2019s not enough time to buy food because we\u2019re already closed.\n\n\u201cWhen this happens, it affects our businesses and sales have been shrinking,\u201d he told TMR.\n\nHe said if operating hours can be extended until 10pm, all restaurant operators will feel a little relieved and satisfied because most of them have more sales at night.\n\n\u201cAny restaurant, they depend more on customers who come at night. If the government is willing to extend the time, 10pm is already okay for us.\u201d\n\nAfnan also opined that the country\u2019s political instability has put a great weight on businesses, making people\u2019s lives more difficult than it already is.\n\n\u201cWe know Covid-19 is dangerous, why would the politicians want to take advantage at a time like this by holding elections and asking people to choose leaders?\n\n\u201cTo me, all of that is unnecessary. They should solve this problem first before their politics. If they can\u2019t help us, don\u2019t help us.\u201d\n\nKedai Kopi Payung owner Nor Baizura Jamil told TMR the operating hours were pleasant at first as it gives time for her to close shop early and rest.\n\n\u201cBut from an economic standpoint, sales have been down to half of what we made before. We have experienced a lot of our customers trying to come and buy food around 6pm or before we close.\u201d\n\nShe also believes that it is better to extend the operating hours so that businesses can run accordingly to reach its sales targets and customers will not feel distressed.\n\nThe situation has caused quite the stir on Twitter when the hashtag #SiBodohKauDengarSini, which translates to \u201cListen here, idiot\u201d, became a trending topic recently.\n\nIt all started when user @farhanazahan complained about not having dinner two nights in a row and that he faced problems while ordering food even though he placed an early order at 5pm.\n\nHe also tweeted that compared to Ismail Sabri, he does not have a maid to serve food at home when he gets back from work.\n\nAnother user @puterirajaawan replied that she \u201cdoes not understand people who create problems out of everything\u201d.\n\nShe suggested ordering the food early to store it in the fridge and reheat it the next day.\n\nThis elicited a response from @yarafaee_ whose tweet started with \u201cSi bodoh, kau dengar sini\u201d before elaborating that food delivery platforms are facing technical problems to fulfil substantial orders during a short window.\n\n\u201cPeople who got back from work do not have time to cook because they have to get up early the next day to go back to work.\u201d\n\nShe also tweeted \u201cinstead of telling the rakyat to find a way, why not ask the government to extend operating hours?\u201d", "keyword": ["govt", "problems", "hours", "early", "closing", "8pm", "instead", "short", "extend", "operating", "reconsiders", "sales", "food", "businesses"], "summary": "Based on social media postings and a quick survey done by The Malaysian Reserve (TMR), many are of the opinion that the shorter operating hours of eateries during the MCO has increased the burden of the rakyat.\nRestoran Mahsuri owner Afnan Aiman said the move to allow businesses, eateries and shops to only operate from 6am to 8pm has caused more hardship to the rakyat, instead of helping them.\n\u201cWhen this happens, it affects our businesses and sales have been shrinking,\u201d he told TMR.\nHe said if operating hours can be extended until 10pm, all restaurant operators will feel a little relieved and satisfied because most of them have more sales at night.\nShe suggested ordering the food early to store it in the fridge and reheat it the next day.", "news": "The Malaysian Reserve", "date": "2021-01-20 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Kapayan rep urges state government to expedite aid efforts to flood victims in Penampang", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVib3JuZW9wb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzAxLzE3L2thcGF5YW4tcmVwLXVyZ2VzLXN0YXRlLWdvdmVybm1lbnQtdG8tZXhwZWRpdGUtYWlkLWVmZm9ydHMtdG8tZmxvb2QtdmljdGltcy1pbi1wZW5hbXBhbmcv0gEA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2021/01/WhatsApp-Image-2021-01-17-at-13.02.58.jpeg", "text": "KOTA KINABALU (Jan 17): Kapayan assemblywoman Jannie Lasimbang urges the Gabungan Rakyat Sabah (GRS) state government to expedite efforts to send assistance to those affected by the flood in Penampang and other districts.\n\nJannie also urged the government to continue to source for funds for the flood mitigation project in Penampang.\n\nJannie in a statement today said she was saddened to see Donggongon township and surrounding villages like Kampung Hungab, Kampung Tunoh, Bundusan as well as a few housing estates there flooded again.\n\n\u201cDuring my time in government, I have tried to find a solution to the flooding problem.

Here, crop losses have been unavoidable as many sections of the fields have been under 2ft to 3ft of water for two to three weeks,\u201d said Carl Bek-Nielsen, chief executive (CEO) of United Plantations Bhd.\n\n\u201cThis adversely affects the ability to enter the fields and harvest the crop, let alone bring out the crop as fields are under water.\u201d\n\nIn Sarawak, Malaysia\u2019s second-biggest palm growing state, the drop in yields may be more severe than the 15% to 20% initially estimated over the next two months, according to Andrew Cheng, CEO of the Sarawak Oil Palm Plantation Owners Association.\n\nThat is because the acute worker shortage compounds production problems caused by floodwaters which have inundated plantations and interrupted harvesting, he said.\n\n\u201cI believe many oil palm plantations in Sarawak\u2019s lower-lying areas will be affected, especially with the King Tide coming in,\u201d Cheng said, referring to an especially high tide, which may lead to prolonged flooding.\n\n\u201cDue to the Covid-19 pandemic and the movement control order, we are unable to assess the overall situation.\u201d Sarawak makes up about 21% of the country\u2019s total palm oil output.\n\nBreaking point\n\nMalaysia\u2019s shortage of palm oil workers has become \u201cmuch, much worse\u201d compared with six months ago, and was likely responsible for up to 90% of the 3.6 million tonnes of fresh fruit bunches lost last year, Bek-Nielsen said.\n\n\u201cWe are at a breaking point that will result in considerable crop losses in 2021,\u201d he said. While first quarter production will not be much lower than last quarter, the impact from the acute labour shortage \u201cwill really start to bite and impact production from April to October\u201d, leading to a drop in output this year to 18.6 million tonnes. Output was 19.14 million tonnes in 2020.\n\nTo relieve the shortage of foreign workers, planters are seeking government approval for a safe way to bring guest workers into Malaysia, where all Covid-19 testing and quarantine costs are borne by employers, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, FGV Holdings Bhd, one of the country\u2019s biggest producers, said about 3,600ha in Pahang, Johor, Perak, Negeri Sembilan and Sabah were affected by flash floods, although there is no serious impact to field operations and mills are running as usual despite a drop in daily volumes.\n\nStill, there will be a \u201cslight impact on yield production due to weather affecting labour productivity in January and in the first quarter\u201d, it said in emailed responses. \u201cWe estimate the potential reduction in yields to be about 20% for January as compared with the earlier month, and by almost 20% in 1Q from the earlier period.\u201d\n\nIn Indonesia, the world\u2019s top producer, plantations have not been affected by the recent flooding in South Kalimantan, according to the Indonesian Palm Oil Association, or Gapki.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["oil", "labour", "crop", "whammy", "double", "floods", "output",

those responsible are held accountable.\n\n\u201cWe are of the opinion that, if Suhakam\u2019s findings are consistent with what the families are claiming, then they should be used as an additional

figures, and must involve a collective effort with a variety of groups.\n\nSuaram lamented the limits that have been placed on Suhakam\u2019s powers by the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia Act 1999, which it says has long \u201chobbled\u201d the institution.\n\nOne example that has been openly debated over the last week is Section 12(2), which stops the commission from inquiring into any complaint once it is before a judicial inquiry, which Suaram said had been the reason for a number of prior investigations being dropped.\n\n\u201cCivil societies have always addressed the inadequacies of the Act and pushed Suhakam to address human rights violations in a broader sense and push the boundaries within its restricted mandate and powers.\u201d\n\nRecently, the non-governmental organisation Eliminating Deaths and Abuse in Custody Together (EDICT) had told Suhakam to stop its inquiries into custodial deaths after it said G Jestus Kevin had died as a result of blunt force trauma.\n\nEDICT claimed that inquiries into custodial death did not come under Suhakam\u2019s purview.\n\nHowever, Suhakam commissioner Mah Weng Kwai insisted that they have the power to investigate any allegation that comes to their attention as long as the matter is not in court, with Suhakam\u2019s investigation into the Jestus case concluding in April, before the matter went to

radius allowed by the government.\n\nIn the incident shared on We Are Malaysian Facebook page, the original poster (OP) said she had ventured out from her home at around 10 am on Sunday (24 Jan) to buy groceries. On her way out, she was stopped by police at a roadblock.\n\n\u201cPolice officer told me \u201cTak logic. U Bagitau Waze itu tepat tak?\u201d\n\nOP explained to the police officers that she was going out to buy food and groceries nearby, adding that she had checked Waze and confirmed that the journey was within 10 km radius of her house.\n\nOP shared in the post that this was her first time being stopped for such an issue at a roadblock, adding that she was completely speechless and confused.\n\nIf Waze is not tepat (accurate) I\u2019ve no idea which is tepat other than Google.

The chants in the evenings and mornings add to the ambiance of this town.\n\nSuicide Point\n\nSuicide Point is 5km away from the town, so if you\u2019re looking for that perfect cliffside Instagram picture, this is the place for it.\n\nVillage tour\n\nKalpa is a self-sustaining village with a lot of organic farming activity going on. You can take a stroll to the farm or visit the old heritage houses in and around the village.\n\nApple Orchard tour\n\nKalpa has many apple orchards and if you are visiting during the harvest season, which is around August or October, be sure to visit them.\n\nAmit and Anindita are Indian Travel bloggers who blog at Travel Like We Do.

Azrul Mohd Khalib\n\nThere is an alarming emerging trend of resident associations and condominium managements requiring the disclosure of confidential medical information related to the Covid-19 status of people living in their neighbourhood.\n\nThere are demands for PCR or antigen test results, copies of passports and pictures of those who are positive. Most are aimed at foreigners. Residents are encouraged to inform on their neighbours. All being done supposedly in the name of collective protection, safety, and security.\n\nThis is a challenging and uncertain time for everyone.\n\nWith daily new Covid-19 numbers reaching record numbers, no peak in sight to the third wave, and more people in our communities, workplaces and families becoming infected, it is natural that we become increasingly fearful and insecure, not just for ourselves but also our loved ones.\n\nThe threat of death and disease, coupled with the general lack of knowledge of how Covid-19 spreads, and the need to blame someone for the pain and suffering that we see among those infected and affected, have led to a cloud of stigma.\n\nStigma now surrounds Covid-19, the people and communities who have contracted the disease. It is causing prejudice, discrimination, and xenophobia, widening inequalities, increasing vulnerabilities to violence, harassment and ostracisation, and hampering public health measures intended to manage the epidemic.\n\nThere are increasing reports of people and families who have recovered from infection or been released from home isolation or quarantine, being marginalised, or ostracised by their neighbours, family members, communities, and even loved ones, resulting in additional anxiety, and falling into depression.\n\nPeople have been blamed for supposedly bringing Covid-19 into housing areas and condominium complexes. Fingers were pointed at migrant workers when they were disproportionately represented in the daily statistics, which led to crackdowns by authorities, and caused fear and anxiety among even documented foreigners.\n\nFormer patients have lost jobs after their recovery. Families have been told to leave their rented homes. Tragically, out of a sense of overwhelming shame and fear of being a burden to their loved ones, some patients have recently taken their own lives. The list of consequences due to Covid-19-related stigma goes on.\n\nAll around the world, for those who have worked on AIDS for the past four decades, this sounds altogether too familiar. The same challenges, problems and harm of stigma and discrimination seen in that epidemic are manifesting themselves in the Covid-19 pandemic. But amid the ongoing tragedy, there is an opportunity.\n\nWe can apply what we have learnt from 40 years of the HIV-AIDS epidemic to what is happening today, in order to address the Covid-19 stigma. We do not need to repeat the same mistakes. We should not lose more lives through abuse, harm and suffering caused by Covid-19 prejudice and discrimination.\n\nIn our fear and frustration, we must resist adopting draconian measures that degrade or compromise on human rights and dignity.\n\nPast successful responses to public health emergencies have demonstrated repeatedly the value of grounding them in human rights.\n\nWe have learnt the hard way from the HIV-AIDS epidemic, that approaches which depend on punitive measures, shaming and discrimination undermine public health objectives and eventually fail in the long run. They end up doing more harm than good.\n\nSolidarity, empathy, and compassion reduce suffering, protect public health and save lives.\n\nNew Zealand has shown that when empathy and compassion are coupled with competence and firmness, the Covid-19 outbreak can be managed effectively and decisively.\n\nHumanise Covid-19 pandemic\n\nTo address Covid-19 stigma, we can do better in four areas.\n\nFirstly, we must humanise the Covid-19 pandemic. Today, the people and lives who have been touched by this disease are almost entirely represented by the health ministry\u2019s daily reported numbers of those infected, recovered, needing intensive care, placed on ventilator support, and who have died.\n\nThe human face of Malaysia\u2019s response to the outbreak is largely missing from these statistics.\n\nAside from what is shared online in social media, there are barely any stories in the mainstream media of people and their lived experiences of being infected and surviving, of the lives that have been lost. This has contributed to the fear, misinformation and stigma surrounding Covid-19.\n\nThe right to confidentiality and privacy of medical information should be protected. However, there are many who are willing and have volunteered to share their experiences, as patients, caregivers, emergency services and healthcare workers.\n\nGiving an opportunity for stories to be broadcast, especially those that are positive and uplifting, will go a long way in dealing with the ignorance and misunderstanding surrounding the disease and towards building a Covid-19 response that is free from stigma and discrimination.\n\nHealthcare workers, who have been at the forefront of the response to this public health emergency for a year now, have resorted to either posting on social media or covertly sharing their pain, suffering and frustrations with trusted media outlets.\n\nMany hope that by doing so, they would inform the public about what is happening in our hospitals and healthcare facilities, the day-to-day realities, and possibly gain public support and empathy.\n\nThe fact that they are forced to do so, often in a discreet manner largely to protect themselves from official repercussions, is a disservice to the sacrifices that they and their families have made. They should not have to do this. We need to highlight their stories in the media, listen to their appeals and respond to their requests for assistance.\n\nSecondly, we need to correct negative language that can fuel fear and stigma. We must avoid the use of stereotypical, negative expressions that can create or increase stigma, and focus on inclusive language.\n\nCommunities at risk or vulnerable to Covid-19 infection have been described as time bombs, fuelling fear and suspicion. Contracting Covid-19 does not mean someone has less value than anyone else.\n\nThe migrant worker community, for example, despite their obvious vulnerability and lack of adequate efforts to protect them, has been unfairly blamed for the outbreak, especially in the third wave.\n\nThirdly, a lesson learnt from people living with HIV is that: \u201cIf you take away our jobs, you will kill us faster than the virus.\u201d\n\nIn our response to dealing with Covid-19, we need to also protect jobs and people\u2019s livelihoods. Covid-19 and the resulting lockdowns have caused tremendous and unprecedented economic turmoil and impacted thousands of households.\n\nDue to lockdowns and closure of economic activities, it has deprived people of livelihoods and caused many families to slip closer towards or deeper into poverty. It is essential that those affected by Covid-19 face no stigma in returning to their jobs. Workers should not fear that they might lose their jobs if they test positive for Covid-19.\n\nPunitive laws do not work\n\nFinally, a key lesson from the HIV response is that exclusion and punitive laws do not work.\n\nEvery day, from the start of the first movement control order, we have heard how many people have been fined or arrested for SOP violations. Rather than contribute towards reductions in the number of people being infected with Covid-19, what it has achieved instead, is create an atmosphere of fear and resentment towards authorities especially with the appearance of double standards.\n\nMany, particularly those from lower income backgrounds have become victims of subjective enforcement.\n\nWith the number of new Covid-19 cases reaching record numbers, this emphasis on a punitive approach to disease prevention and control should be reviewed.\n\nThis is a public health emergency, not a war. There are no winners or losers, good sides or bad sides.\n\nIn this public health crisis, we need to look to our common humanity. Anyone can get infected during this global pandemic. Covid-19 does not discriminate, and neither should our response.\n\nWe should treat the individuals and communities affected by Covid-19 the same way how we would wish ourselves to be treated, with empathy and compassion. Government, community leaders and public health officials can lead by example and help prevent stigma and discrimination.\n\nNo one is safe until we are all safe, and stopping stigma is critical to making our communities safer and healthier. We need to work together to prevent and address stigma.\n\nAzrul Mohd Khalib is the head of Galen Centre for Health & Social Policy and is an FMT reader.\n\nThe views expressed are those of the writer

The next few years will decide whether Samsung will become, say, a global platform company or remain a hardware company,\u201d he said.\n\nLee, 52, has been the de facto head of Samsung Electronics since his father, Lee Kun-hee, was hospitalised after a heart attack in 2014.\n\nThe elder Lee died in October, but the chairmanship he held has yet to be filled, and uncertainty cast by his son\u2019s legal troubles was the chief reason, analysts said.\n\nVice-chairman since 2012, Lee has yet to make a mark \u2013 as his father did \u2013 by building the semiconductor business, which now brings in half of Samsung Electronics profits.\n\nAmid the moves meant to ensure his succession, Lee has fought against allegations of legal wrongdoing, including a year in prison in 2017-2018 over a bribery case involving impeached President Park Geun-hye.\n\nFlagship businesses\n\nOne of Lee\u2019s focuses is Samsung\u2019s non-memory chip business, including chip contract manufacturing, calling on the staff to \u201ccreate another legend\u201d.\n\nSamsung plans to invest US$121.47 billion in non-memory chips through 2030 to become No 1, including in chip contract manufacturing, where its 17% market share is a distant second to current No 1 TSMC\u2019s 54%, according to TrendForce.\n\nSamsung has also touted Lee\u2019s deal-making skills in winning a US$6.6 billion contract from Verizon last year, describing the network equipment business \u2013 still small compared with that of rivals like Huawei \u2013 as a key business area.\n\nLee also needs to deal with paying inheritance tax to maintain control of the tech giant. Since Lee Kun-hee passed away, an estimated US$10.05 billion in inheritance tax is expected to be needed for his family to inherit his listed stockholdings alone.\n\nAnd he faces a separate trial over suspected accounting fraud and stock price manipulation connected to a 2015 merger that helped him assume greater control of Samsung Electronics.\n\nSuper-class company\n\nUrbane, reserved and media-shy, Lee has shown a relaxed side in public more recently after his release from detention.\n\nHe has been pictured eating lunch in staff cafeterias, taking selfies with employees, and smiling brightly when President Moon Jae-in visited a Samsung worksite in April 2019.\n\nIn May, he said he would not hand over management rights to his children and apologised for the behaviour of executives caught sabotaging labour union activities.\n\n\u201cA true super-class company is a sustainable company \u2026 I want to make a new Samsung,\u201d Lee said during his final statement to the court in December.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["business", "legal", "company", "lee", "manufacturing", "stepping", "samsung", "jaeyong", "shadow", "samsungs", "contract", "electronics", "cusp", "including", "chip", "fathers"], "summary": "SEOUL: For years, legal troubles have cast a cloud over Samsung Electronics Vice-Chairman Lee Jae-yong as he stood on the cusp of stepping out of his father\u2019s shadow and making a name for himself as the leader of the global tech giant.\nLee, 52, has been the de facto head of Samsung Electronics since his father, Lee Kun-hee, was hospitalised after a heart attack in 2014.\nFlagship businessesOne of Lee\u2019s focuses is Samsung\u2019s non-memory chip business, including chip contract manufacturing, calling on the staff to \u201ccreate another legend\u201d.\nAnd he faces a separate trial over suspected accounting fraud and stock price manipulation connected to a 2015 merger that helped him assume greater control of Samsung Electronics.\n\u201cA true super-class company is a sustainable company \u2026 I want to make a new Samsung,\u201d Lee said during his final statement to the court in December.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-01-17 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Insurance companies seeking ways to ease patients\u2019 expenses", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wMS8xNy9pbnN1cmFuY2UtY29tcGFuaWVzLXNlZWtpbmctd2F5cy10by1lYXNlLXBhdGllbnRzLWV4cGVuc2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/admission-registration-counter-sunway-medical-fb.jpg", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: Insurance and takaful companies said today they are working with the health ministry and Bank Negara Malaysia to explore ways to ease some of the expenses of Covid-19 patients who are treated in private hospitals.\n\nIn a joint statement, the Life Insurance Association of Malaysia, General Insurance Association of Malaysia and Malaysian Takaful Association said pandemic-related risks are generally not covered under any insurance and takaful plans worldwide.\n\n\u201cThe exclusion stems from the difficulty in pricing for coverage relating to an event like a pandemic that may occur once in a lifetime, having an incalculable impact and cost.

has been streamlined even further to specific services, after more than a week of the movement control order (MCO) this year.\n\nThe latest update of the MCO regulations gazetted on January 21 and published on the Federal Government Gazette\u2019s website lists 52 items under essential services, instead of 50 items in the January 15 gazette.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s what has changed in the latest list of essential services that can operate during MCO 2.0:\n\nInternet, postal, courier, broadcasting, call centre now specified\n\nIn the January 15 list (old), telecommunications and information technology were grouped together as item 28, but this category of services has been made more detailed in the latest January 21 list (new) by splitting them into item 28 and item 29 and adding new specific services such as call centres and internet services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOld: 28. Telecommunication and digital infrastructures including information and communication technology services and global business services\n\nNew: 28. Communications including telecommunications and internet, postal and courier, and broadcasting\n\n29. Information technology including global business services and call centre\n\nSlight change for e-commerce detail\n\nThe new list includes a slight tweak to the old list in the e-commerce item.\n\nOld: 29. E-commerce including e-marketplace, digital payment and local e-commerce internet centre services\n\nNew: 30: E-commerce including e-marketplace, digital payment and local e-commerce services centre\n\nNew category added on\n\nThis item was not mentioned in the old list.\n\nNew: 31. Digital creative content development in studio including film editing\n\nBoth the old and new lists contain a catch-all phrase of \u201cAny service, work, industry of business as determined by the Minister of Health after consulting the authority that regulates the services, work, industry and business\u201d, which essentially means that any businesses not included in the gazetted list of essential services may still be allowed to operate if the health minister decides that they can operate.\n\nThe new gazetted list takes effect on January 22, and applies to the whole of Malaysia except Sarawak \u2014 Johor, Kedah, Kelantan, Melaka, Negri Sembilan, Pahang, Penang, Perak, Perlis, Sabah, Selangor, Terengganu, Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya, Labuan \u2014 until February 2 which is when MCO is due to end. The new list also applies to Sibu in Sarawak where the MCO is scheduled to end January 29.\n\nThis is not the first time that the government has made changes to the list of essential services allowed to operate during MCO 2.0.\n\nThe Ministry of International Trade and Industry had on January 12 afternoon released a list of essential services for MCO 2.0 that included automotive manufacturing and after-sales services, but updated the list the same evening by removing that exemption and only listing automotive repair and maintenance as an essential service.\n\nThe government in MCO regulations gazetted on January 12 listed the manufacturing and production of \u201cautomotive equipment\u201d as an essential service but did not include automotive repair and maintenance.\n\nThe January 15 gazetted list of essential services updated this to be the manufacturing and production of \u201cautomotive (vehicles and components)\u201d instead of the \u201cautomotive equipment\u201d previously listed, while also adding \u201cautomotive (maintenance and repair)\u201d as a separate business under the services category that is allowed to continue to operate.\n\nThe changes in the list of essential services had resulted in carmakers Hondo, Toyota and Perodua briefly stopping activities in their factories in Malaysia, before resuming operations again.\n\nWhere to get the latest information\n\nIf you are a business owner and want to know about the latest rules, guidelines, standard operating procedures or frequently-asked questions issued by Miti, there is a dedicated section on the ministry\u2019s website with such MCO-related information (https://www.miti.gov.my/redir/pkp/pkp.html).\n\nHowever when Malay Mail visited the Miti website section dedicated to MCO information at around noon on Thursday, various editions \u2014 both old and new \u2014 of the list of essential services were found on the website.\n\nThis dedicated section has six sections: Media release, FAQs, SOPs and gazette, infographic, CIMS 3.0 tutorial video, and email enquiry.\n\nThe FAQ document in the FAQ section which was issued on January 12 by Miti in Bahasa Malaysia, comes with a list of essential services written in Bahasa Malaysia dated January 12.\n\nIn the media release section, a media release in English and issued on January 12 comes with a list of essential services written in English which was updated as of January 16 and sourced from the January 15 gazetted list.\n\nThe infographics section of the site carries two sets of slides or infographics \u2014 one in Bahasa Malaysia and another in English \u2014 on the list of essential services, with this based also on the January 15 gazetted list.\n\nAlso included in the infographics section is a set of slides dated January 20 of the list of 16 businesses allowed by the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) to operate during the MCO, with this list written in Bahasa Malaysia: Shopping complexes or malls, supermarkets and hypermarkets, departmental stores, pharmacies or selling of personal care products, convenience stores or mini marts, laundry shops (not including self-service laundromats), restaurants, furniture stores, jewellery shops, electrics and electronics stores, bookshops and stationery shops, hardware stores, pet food, vehicle workshops or maintenance or spare parts, vehicle sales and distribution centres, speciality retail stores at petrol stations.\n\n(On January 12, senior minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob when announcing the government\u2019s rules for areas under MCO had said that laundry shops except for self-service laundromats will be allowed to operate from 6am to 8pm. Following public complaints, Ismail Sabri however on January 14 said self-service laundromats will also be allowed to operate during MCO, with the condition that a worker is present to ensure physical distancing and check customers\u2019 body temperature. Although optometrists were not included in KPDNHEP\u2019s initial list, the government on January 15 confirmed that they were now allowed by the KPDNHEP to open during MCO based on tighter SOPs.)\n\nIn the SOPs and gazette section on Miti\u2019s MCO site, clicking on the federal gazette would lead to the latest January 21 government gazette containing the latest list of essential services, while the SOPs posted is also the latest National Security Council\u2019s general SOPs for MCO areas which is dated January 21.\n\nAs of noon yesterday, Miti\u2019s Facebook and Twitter accounts have yet to post information regarding the updated details in the gazetted list of essential services allowed to operate.\n\nAs for Sarawak (except for Sibu) which is under the conditional movement control order (CMCO) until January 31, the latest CMCO regulations gazetted by the federal government on January 21 maintains the list of prohibited activities that had been in use in previous editions of CMCO rules.\n\nThe list of prohibited activities under CMCO are: Outbound tour activities by Malaysians and inbound tour activities involving foreign tourists except foreign tourists from countries specified by the health minister, activities in pubs and nightclubs except for restaurant business in pubs and nightclubs, and any activity with many people attending at a place which makes it difficult to carry out physical distancing and to comply with the health director-general\u2019s directions. \u2015 Malay Mail\n\nRelated reading", "keyword": ["operate",

during the first MCO last year.\n\nThis time, he said, the MCO\u2019s purpose was to stabilise the nation\u2019s number of infections which had been on the rise since October 2020.\n\nWe do not want

It is still being reviewed,\u201d he said.\n\nBased on social media postings and a quick survey done by The Malaysian Reserve (TMR), many are of the opinion that the shorter operating hours of eateries during the MCO has increased the burden of the rakyat.\n\nRestoran Mahsuri owner Afnan Aiman said the move to allow businesses, eateries and shops to only operate from 6am to 8pm has caused more hardship to the rakyat, instead of helping them.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s not okay. Businesses have been a little slow because now we can\u2019t dine in and time is too limited because people would usually finish work at 6pm or much later, and by the time they reach home, there\u2019s not enough time to buy food because we\u2019re already closed.\n\n\u201cWhen this happens, it affects our businesses and sales have been shrinking,\u201d he told TMR.\n\nHe said if operating hours can be extended until 10pm, all restaurant operators will feel a little relieved and satisfied because most of them have more sales at night.\n\n\u201cAny restaurant, they depend more on customers who come at night. If the government is willing to extend the time, 10pm is already okay for us.\u201d\n\nAfnan also opined that the country\u2019s political instability has put a great weight on businesses, making people\u2019s lives more difficult than it already is.\n\n\u201cWe know Covid-19 is dangerous, why would the politicians want to take advantage at a time like this by holding elections and asking people to choose leaders?\n\n\u201cTo me, all of that is unnecessary.

Here, crop losses have been unavoidable as many sections of the fields have been under 2ft to 3ft of water for two to three weeks,\u201d said Carl Bek-Nielsen, chief executive (CEO) of United Plantations Bhd.\n\n\u201cThis adversely affects the ability to enter the fields and harvest the crop, let alone bring out the crop as fields are under water.\u201d\n\nIn Sarawak, Malaysia\u2019s second-biggest palm growing state, the drop in yields may be more severe than the 15% to 20% initially estimated over the next two months, according to Andrew Cheng, CEO of the Sarawak Oil Palm Plantation Owners Association.\n\nThat is because the acute worker shortage compounds production problems caused by floodwaters which have inundated plantations and interrupted harvesting, he said.\n\n\u201cI believe many oil palm plantations in Sarawak\u2019s lower-lying areas will be affected, especially with the King Tide coming in,\u201d Cheng said, referring to an especially high tide, which may lead to prolonged flooding.\n\n\u201cDue to the Covid-19 pandemic and the movement control order, we are unable to assess the overall situation.\u201d Sarawak makes up about 21% of the country\u2019s total palm oil output.\n\nBreaking point\n\nMalaysia\u2019s shortage of palm oil workers has become \u201cmuch, much worse\u201d compared with six months ago, and was likely responsible for up to 90% of the 3.6 million tonnes of fresh fruit bunches lost last year, Bek-Nielsen said.\n\n\u201cWe are at a breaking point that will result in considerable crop losses in 2021,\u201d he said. While first quarter production will not be much lower than last quarter, the impact from the acute labour shortage \u201cwill really start to bite and impact production from April to October\u201d, leading to a drop in output this year to 18.6 million tonnes. Output was 19.14 million tonnes in 2020.\n\nTo relieve the shortage of foreign workers, planters are seeking government approval for a safe way to bring guest workers into Malaysia, where all Covid-19 testing and quarantine costs are borne by employers, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, FGV Holdings Bhd, one of the country\u2019s biggest producers, said about 3,600ha in Pahang, Johor, Perak, Negeri Sembilan and Sabah were affected by flash floods, although there is no serious impact to field operations and mills are running as usual despite a drop in daily volumes.\n\nStill, there will be a \u201cslight impact on yield production due to weather affecting labour productivity in January and in the first quarter\u201d, it said in emailed responses. \u201cWe estimate the potential reduction in yields to be about 20% for January as compared with the earlier month, and by almost 20% in 1Q from the earlier period.\u201d\n\nIn Indonesia, the world\u2019s top producer, plantations have not been affected by the recent flooding in South Kalimantan, according to the Indonesian Palm Oil Association, or Gapki.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["oil", "labour", "crop", "whammy", "double", "floods", "output",

Azrul Mohd Khalib\n\nThere is an alarming emerging trend of resident associations and condominium managements requiring the disclosure of confidential medical information related to the Covid-19 status of people living in their neighbourhood.\n\nThere are demands for PCR or antigen test results, copies of passports and pictures of those who are positive. Most are aimed at foreigners. Residents are encouraged to inform on their neighbours. All being done supposedly in the name of collective protection, safety, and security.\n\nThis is a challenging and uncertain time for everyone.\n\nWith daily new Covid-19 numbers reaching record numbers, no peak in sight to the third wave, and more people in our communities, workplaces and families becoming infected, it is natural that we become increasingly fearful and insecure, not just for ourselves but also our loved ones.\n\nThe threat of death and disease, coupled with the general lack of knowledge of how Covid-19 spreads, and the need to blame someone for the pain and suffering that we see among those infected and affected, have led to a cloud of stigma.\n\nStigma now surrounds Covid-19, the people and communities who have contracted the disease. It is causing prejudice, discrimination, and xenophobia, widening inequalities, increasing vulnerabilities to violence, harassment and ostracisation, and hampering public health measures intended to manage the epidemic.\n\nThere are increasing reports of people and families who have recovered from infection or been released from home isolation or quarantine, being marginalised, or ostracised by their neighbours, family members, communities, and even loved ones, resulting in additional anxiety, and falling into depression.\n\nPeople have been blamed for supposedly bringing Covid-19 into housing areas and condominium complexes. Fingers were pointed at migrant workers when they were disproportionately represented in the daily statistics, which led to crackdowns by authorities, and caused fear and anxiety among even documented foreigners.\n\nFormer patients have lost jobs after their recovery. Families have been told to leave their rented homes. Tragically, out of a sense of overwhelming shame and fear of being a burden to their loved ones, some patients have recently taken their own lives. The list of consequences due to Covid-19-related stigma goes on.\n\nAll around the world, for those who have worked on AIDS for the past four decades, this sounds altogether too familiar. The same challenges, problems and harm of stigma and discrimination seen in that epidemic are manifesting themselves in the Covid-19 pandemic. But amid the ongoing tragedy, there is an opportunity.\n\nWe can apply what we have learnt from 40 years of the HIV-AIDS epidemic to what is happening today, in order to address the Covid-19 stigma. We do not need to repeat the same mistakes. We should not lose more lives through abuse, harm and suffering caused by Covid-19 prejudice and discrimination.\n\nIn our fear and frustration, we must resist adopting draconian measures that degrade or compromise on human rights and dignity.\n\nPast successful responses to public health emergencies have demonstrated repeatedly the value of grounding them in human rights.\n\nWe have learnt the hard way from the HIV-AIDS epidemic, that approaches which depend on punitive measures, shaming and discrimination undermine public health objectives and eventually fail in the long run. They end up doing more harm than good.\n\nSolidarity, empathy, and compassion reduce suffering, protect public health and save lives.\n\nNew Zealand has shown that when empathy and compassion are coupled with competence and firmness, the Covid-19 outbreak can be managed effectively and decisively.\n\nHumanise Covid-19 pandemic\n\nTo address Covid-19 stigma, we can do better in four areas.\n\nFirstly, we must humanise the Covid-19 pandemic. Today, the people and lives who have been touched by this disease are almost entirely represented by the health ministry\u2019s daily reported numbers of those infected, recovered, needing intensive care, placed on ventilator support, and who have died.\n\nThe human face of Malaysia\u2019s response to the outbreak is largely missing from these statistics.\n\nAside from what is shared online in social media, there are barely any stories in the mainstream media of people and their lived experiences of being infected and surviving, of the lives that have been lost. This has contributed to the fear, misinformation and stigma surrounding Covid-19.\n\nThe right to confidentiality and privacy of medical information should be protected. However, there are many who are willing and have volunteered to share their experiences, as patients, caregivers, emergency services and healthcare workers.\n\nGiving an opportunity for stories to be broadcast, especially those that are positive and uplifting, will go a long way in dealing with the ignorance and misunderstanding surrounding the disease and towards building a Covid-19 response that is free from stigma and discrimination.\n\nHealthcare workers, who have been at the forefront of the response to this public health emergency for a year now, have resorted to either posting on social media or covertly sharing their pain, suffering and frustrations with trusted media outlets.\n\nMany hope that by doing so, they would inform the public about what is happening in our hospitals and healthcare facilities, the day-to-day realities, and possibly gain public support and empathy.\n\nThe fact that they are forced to do so, often in a discreet manner largely to protect themselves from official repercussions, is a disservice to the sacrifices that they and their families have made. They should not have to do this. We need to highlight their stories in the media, listen to their appeals and respond to their requests for assistance.\n\nSecondly, we need to correct negative language that can fuel fear and stigma. We must avoid the use of stereotypical, negative expressions that can create or increase stigma, and focus on inclusive language.\n\nCommunities at risk or vulnerable to Covid-19 infection have been described as time bombs, fuelling fear and suspicion. Contracting Covid-19 does not mean someone has less value than anyone else.\n\nThe migrant worker community, for example, despite their obvious vulnerability and lack of adequate efforts to protect them, has been unfairly blamed for the outbreak, especially in the third wave.\n\nThirdly, a lesson learnt from people living with HIV is that: \u201cIf you take away our jobs, you will kill us faster than the virus.\u201d\n\nIn our response to dealing with Covid-19, we need to also protect jobs and people\u2019s livelihoods. Covid-19 and the resulting lockdowns have caused tremendous and unprecedented economic turmoil and impacted thousands of households.\n\nDue to lockdowns and closure of economic activities, it has deprived people of livelihoods and caused many families to slip closer towards or deeper into poverty. It is essential that those affected by Covid-19 face no stigma in returning to their jobs. Workers should not fear that they might lose their jobs if they test positive for Covid-19.\n\nPunitive laws do not work\n\nFinally, a key lesson from the HIV response is that exclusion and punitive laws do not work.\n\nEvery day, from the start of the first movement control order, we have heard how many people have been fined or arrested for SOP violations. Rather than contribute towards reductions in the number of people being infected with Covid-19, what it has achieved instead, is create an atmosphere of fear and resentment towards authorities especially with the appearance of double standards.\n\nMany, particularly those from lower income backgrounds have become victims of subjective enforcement.\n\nWith the number of new Covid-19 cases reaching record numbers, this emphasis on a punitive approach to disease prevention and control should be reviewed.\n\nThis is a public health emergency, not a war. There are no winners or losers, good sides or bad sides.\n\nIn this public health crisis, we need to look to our common humanity. Anyone can get infected during this global pandemic. Covid-19 does not discriminate, and neither should our response.\n\nWe should treat the individuals and communities affected by Covid-19 the same way how we would wish ourselves to be treated, with empathy and compassion. Government, community leaders and public health officials can lead by example and help prevent stigma and discrimination.\n\nNo one is safe until we are all safe, and stopping stigma is critical to making our communities safer and healthier. We need to work together to prevent and address stigma.\n\nAzrul Mohd Khalib is the head of Galen Centre for Health & Social Policy and is an FMT reader.\n\nThe views expressed are those of the writer

The next few years will decide whether Samsung will become, say, a global platform company or remain a hardware company,\u201d he said.\n\nLee, 52, has been the de facto head of Samsung Electronics since his father, Lee Kun-hee, was hospitalised after a heart attack in 2014.\n\nThe elder Lee died in October, but the chairmanship he held has yet to be filled, and uncertainty cast by his son\u2019s legal troubles was the chief reason, analysts said.\n\nVice-chairman since 2012, Lee has yet to make a mark \u2013 as his father did \u2013 by building the semiconductor business, which now brings in half of Samsung Electronics profits.\n\nAmid the moves meant to ensure his succession, Lee has fought against allegations of legal wrongdoing, including a year in prison in 2017-2018 over a bribery case involving impeached President Park Geun-hye.\n\nFlagship businesses\n\nOne of Lee\u2019s focuses is Samsung\u2019s non-memory chip business, including chip contract manufacturing, calling on the staff to \u201ccreate another legend\u201d.\n\nSamsung plans to invest US$121.47 billion in non-memory chips through 2030 to become No 1, including in chip contract manufacturing, where its 17% market share is a distant second to current No 1 TSMC\u2019s 54%, according to TrendForce.\n\nSamsung has also touted Lee\u2019s deal-making skills in winning a US$6.6 billion contract from Verizon last year, describing the network equipment business \u2013 still small compared with that of rivals like Huawei \u2013 as a key business area.\n\nLee also needs to deal with paying inheritance tax to maintain control of the tech giant. Since Lee Kun-hee passed away, an estimated US$10.05 billion in inheritance tax is expected to be needed for his family to inherit his listed stockholdings alone.\n\nAnd he faces a separate trial over suspected accounting fraud and stock price manipulation connected to a 2015 merger that helped him assume greater control of Samsung Electronics.\n\nSuper-class company\n\nUrbane, reserved and media-shy, Lee has shown a relaxed side in public more recently after his release from detention.\n\nHe has been pictured eating lunch in staff cafeterias, taking selfies with employees, and smiling brightly when President Moon Jae-in visited a Samsung worksite in April 2019.\n\nIn May, he said he would not hand over management rights to his children and apologised for the behaviour of executives caught sabotaging labour union activities.\n\n\u201cA true super-class company is a sustainable company \u2026 I want to make a new Samsung,\u201d Lee said during his final statement to the court in December.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["business", "legal", "company", "lee", "manufacturing", "stepping", "samsung", "jaeyong", "shadow", "samsungs", "contract", "electronics", "cusp", "including", "chip", "fathers"], "summary": "SEOUL: For years, legal troubles have cast a cloud over Samsung Electronics Vice-Chairman Lee Jae-yong as he stood on the cusp of stepping out of his father\u2019s shadow and making a name for himself as the leader of the global tech giant.\nLee, 52, has been the de facto head of Samsung Electronics since his father, Lee Kun-hee, was hospitalised after a heart attack in 2014.\nFlagship businessesOne of Lee\u2019s focuses is Samsung\u2019s non-memory chip business, including chip contract manufacturing, calling on the staff to \u201ccreate another legend\u201d.\nAnd he faces a separate trial over suspected accounting fraud and stock price manipulation connected to a 2015 merger that helped him assume greater control of Samsung Electronics.\n\u201cA true super-class company is a sustainable company \u2026 I want to make a new Samsung,\u201d Lee said during his final statement to the court in December.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-01-17 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Insurance companies seeking ways to ease patients\u2019 expenses", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wMS8xNy9pbnN1cmFuY2UtY29tcGFuaWVzLXNlZWtpbmctd2F5cy10by1lYXNlLXBhdGllbnRzLWV4cGVuc2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/admission-registration-counter-sunway-medical-fb.jpg", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: Insurance and takaful companies said today they are working with the health ministry and Bank Negara Malaysia to explore ways to ease some of the expenses of Covid-19 patients who are treated in private hospitals.\n\nIn a joint statement, the Life Insurance Association of Malaysia, General Insurance Association of Malaysia and Malaysian Takaful Association said pandemic-related risks are generally not covered under any insurance and takaful plans worldwide.\n\n\u201cThe exclusion stems from the difficulty in pricing for coverage relating to an event like a pandemic that may occur once in a lifetime, having an incalculable impact and cost.

of the wholesale market was ordered to close from Monday to Friday this week, after Covid-19 cases were detected in the market.\n\n\u201cMelaka KPDNHEP is trying to get supplies from Cameron Highlands, Pahang but the flood situation there has not improved and this has hampered our efforts,\u201d she said when contacted by Bernama here today.\n\nNorena said apart from Cameron Highlands the agency would also try to get supplies of organic vegetables from farmers in Melaka, but they would cost more adding that consumers avoid buying organic vegetables as they were expensive.\n\nMeanwhile she said with more people staying home due to the movement control order (MCO) more people are spending time to cook and this has affected the supply of cooking oil, especially the one-kilogram packets.\n\n\u201cAs such we will limit sale of the 1kg cooking oil packets to three packets per customer, while waiting for the flood situation in Pahang to improve, as supplies of cooking oil in the

celebration next month.\n\nLast Monday, a news portal reported over 90 Covid-19 positive cases were detected in the Selayang Wholesale Market which led to its closure for four days from last Monday,

has been streamlined even further to specific services, after more than a week of the movement control order (MCO) this year.\n\nThe latest update of the MCO regulations gazetted on January 21 and published on the Federal Government Gazette\u2019s website lists 52 items under essential services, instead of 50 items in the January 15 gazette.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s what has changed in the latest list of essential services that can operate during MCO 2.0:\n\nInternet, postal, courier, broadcasting, call centre now specified\n\nIn the January 15 list (old), telecommunications and information technology were grouped together as item 28, but this category of services has been made more detailed in the latest January 21 list (new) by splitting them into item 28 and item 29 and adding new specific services such as call centres and internet services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOld: 28. Telecommunication and digital infrastructures including information and communication technology services and global business services\n\nNew: 28. Communications including telecommunications and internet, postal and courier, and broadcasting\n\n29. Information technology including global business services and call centre\n\nSlight change for e-commerce detail\n\nThe new list includes a slight tweak to the old list in the e-commerce item.\n\nOld: 29. E-commerce including e-marketplace, digital payment and local e-commerce internet centre services\n\nNew: 30: E-commerce including e-marketplace, digital payment and local e-commerce services centre\n\nNew category added on\n\nThis item was not mentioned in the old list.\n\nNew: 31. Digital creative content development in studio including film editing\n\nBoth the old and new lists contain a catch-all phrase of \u201cAny service, work, industry of business as determined by the Minister of Health after consulting the authority that regulates the services, work, industry and business\u201d, which essentially means that any businesses not included in the gazetted list of essential services may still be allowed to operate if the health minister decides that they can operate.\n\nThe new gazetted list takes effect on January 22, and applies to the whole of Malaysia except Sarawak \u2014 Johor, Kedah, Kelantan, Melaka, Negri Sembilan, Pahang, Penang, Perak, Perlis, Sabah, Selangor, Terengganu, Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya, Labuan \u2014 until February 2 which is when MCO is due to end. The new list also applies to Sibu in Sarawak where the MCO is scheduled to end January 29.\n\nThis is not the first time that the government has made changes to the list of essential services allowed to operate during MCO 2.0.\n\nThe Ministry of International Trade and Industry had on January 12 afternoon released a list of essential services for MCO 2.0 that included automotive manufacturing and after-sales services, but updated the list the same evening by removing that exemption and only listing automotive repair and maintenance as an essential service.\n\nThe government in MCO regulations gazetted on January 12 listed the manufacturing and production of \u201cautomotive equipment\u201d as an essential service but did not include automotive repair and maintenance.\n\nThe January 15 gazetted list of essential services updated this to be the manufacturing and production of \u201cautomotive (vehicles and components)\u201d instead of the \u201cautomotive equipment\u201d previously listed, while also adding \u201cautomotive (maintenance and repair)\u201d as a separate business under the services category that is allowed to continue to operate.\n\nThe changes in the list of essential services had resulted in carmakers Hondo, Toyota and Perodua briefly stopping activities in their factories in Malaysia, before resuming operations again.\n\nWhere to get the latest information\n\nIf you are a business owner and want to know about the latest rules, guidelines, standard operating procedures or frequently-asked questions issued by Miti, there is a dedicated section on the ministry\u2019s website with such MCO-related information (https://www.miti.gov.my/redir/pkp/pkp.html).\n\nHowever when Malay Mail visited the Miti website section dedicated to MCO information at around noon on Thursday, various editions \u2014 both old and new \u2014 of the list of essential services were found on the website.\n\nThis dedicated section has six sections: Media release, FAQs, SOPs and gazette, infographic, CIMS 3.0 tutorial video, and email enquiry.\n\nThe FAQ document in the FAQ section which was issued on January 12 by Miti in Bahasa Malaysia, comes with a list of essential services written in Bahasa Malaysia dated January 12.\n\nIn the media release section, a media release in English and issued on January 12 comes with a list of essential services written in English which was updated as of January 16 and sourced from the January 15 gazetted list.\n\nThe infographics section of the site carries two sets of slides or infographics \u2014 one in Bahasa Malaysia and another in English \u2014 on the list of essential services, with this based also on the January 15 gazetted list.\n\nAlso included in the infographics section is a set of slides dated January 20 of the list of 16 businesses allowed by the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) to operate during the MCO, with this list written in Bahasa Malaysia: Shopping complexes or malls, supermarkets and hypermarkets, departmental stores, pharmacies or selling of personal care products, convenience stores or mini marts, laundry shops (not including self-service laundromats), restaurants, furniture stores, jewellery shops, electrics and electronics stores, bookshops and stationery shops, hardware stores, pet food, vehicle workshops or maintenance or spare parts, vehicle sales and distribution centres, speciality retail stores at petrol stations.\n\n(On January 12, senior minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob when announcing the government\u2019s rules for areas under MCO had said that laundry shops except for self-service laundromats will be allowed to operate from 6am to 8pm. Following public complaints, Ismail Sabri however on January 14 said self-service laundromats will also be allowed to operate during MCO, with the condition that a worker is present to ensure physical distancing and check customers\u2019 body temperature. Although optometrists were not included in KPDNHEP\u2019s initial list, the government on January 15 confirmed that they were now allowed by the KPDNHEP to open during MCO based on tighter SOPs.)\n\nIn the SOPs and gazette section on Miti\u2019s MCO site, clicking on the federal gazette would lead to the latest January 21 government gazette containing the latest list of essential services, while the SOPs posted is also the latest National Security Council\u2019s general SOPs for MCO areas which is dated January 21.\n\nAs of noon yesterday, Miti\u2019s Facebook and Twitter accounts have yet to post information regarding the updated details in the gazetted list of essential services allowed to operate.\n\nAs for Sarawak (except for Sibu) which is under the conditional movement control order (CMCO) until January 31, the latest CMCO regulations gazetted by the federal government on January 21 maintains the list of prohibited activities that had been in use in previous editions of CMCO rules.\n\nThe list of prohibited activities under CMCO are: Outbound tour activities by Malaysians and inbound tour activities involving foreign tourists except foreign tourists from countries specified by the health minister, activities in pubs and nightclubs except for restaurant business in pubs and nightclubs, and any activity with many people attending at a place which makes it difficult to carry out physical distancing and to comply with the health director-general\u2019s directions. \u2015 Malay Mail\n\nRelated reading", "keyword": ["operate",

It is still being reviewed,\u201d he said.\n\nBased on social media postings and a quick survey done by The Malaysian Reserve (TMR), many are of the opinion that the shorter operating hours of eateries during the MCO has increased the burden of the rakyat.\n\nRestoran Mahsuri owner Afnan Aiman said the move to allow businesses, eateries and shops to only operate from 6am to 8pm has caused more hardship to the rakyat, instead of helping them.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s not okay. Businesses have been a little slow because now we can\u2019t dine in and time is too limited because people would usually finish work at 6pm or much later, and by the time they reach home, there\u2019s not enough time to buy food because we\u2019re already closed.\n\n\u201cWhen this happens, it affects our businesses and sales have been shrinking,\u201d he told TMR.\n\nHe said if operating hours can be extended until 10pm, all restaurant operators will feel a little relieved and satisfied because most of them have more sales at night.\n\n\u201cAny restaurant, they depend more on customers who come at night. If the government is willing to extend the time, 10pm is already okay for us.\u201d\n\nAfnan also opined that the country\u2019s political instability has put a great weight on businesses, making people\u2019s lives more difficult than it already is.\n\n\u201cWe know Covid-19 is dangerous, why would the politicians want to take advantage at a time like this by holding elections and asking people to choose leaders?\n\n\u201cTo me, all of that is unnecessary. They should solve this problem first before their politics. If they can\u2019t help us, don\u2019t help us.\u201d\n\nKedai Kopi Payung owner Nor Baizura Jamil told TMR the operating hours were pleasant at first as it gives time for her to close shop early and rest.\n\n\u201cBut from an economic standpoint, sales have been down to half of what we made before. We have experienced a lot of our customers trying to come and buy food around 6pm or before we close.\u201d\n\nShe also believes that it is better to extend the operating hours so that businesses can run accordingly to reach its sales targets and customers will not feel distressed.\n\nThe situation has caused quite the stir on Twitter when the hashtag #SiBodohKauDengarSini, which translates to \u201cListen here, idiot\u201d, became a trending topic recently.\n\nIt all started when user @farhanazahan complained about not having dinner two nights in a row and that he faced problems while ordering food even though he placed an early order at 5pm.\n\nHe also tweeted that compared to Ismail Sabri, he does not have a maid to serve food at home when he gets back from work.\n\nAnother user @puterirajaawan replied that she \u201cdoes not understand people who create problems out of everything\u201d.\n\nShe suggested ordering the food early to store it in the fridge and reheat it the next day.\n\nThis elicited a response from @yarafaee_ whose tweet started with \u201cSi bodoh, kau dengar sini\u201d before elaborating that food delivery platforms are facing technical problems to fulfil substantial orders during a short window.\n\n\u201cPeople who got back from work do not have time to cook because they have to get up early the next day to go back to work.\u201d\n\nShe also tweeted \u201cinstead of telling the rakyat to find a way, why not ask the government to extend operating hours?\u201d", "keyword": ["govt", "problems", "hours", "early", "closing", "8pm", "instead", "short", "extend", "operating", "reconsiders", "sales", "food", "businesses"], "summary": "Based on social media postings and a quick survey done by The Malaysian Reserve (TMR), many are of the opinion that the shorter operating hours of eateries during the MCO has increased the burden of the rakyat.\nRestoran Mahsuri owner Afnan Aiman said the move to allow businesses, eateries and shops to only operate from 6am to 8pm has caused more hardship to the rakyat, instead of helping them.\n\u201cWhen this happens, it affects our businesses and sales have been shrinking,\u201d he told TMR.\nHe said if operating hours can be extended until 10pm, all restaurant operators will feel a little relieved and satisfied because most of them have more sales at night.\nShe suggested ordering the food early to store it in the fridge and reheat it the next day.", "news": "The Malaysian Reserve", "date": "2021-01-20 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Kapayan rep urges state government to expedite aid efforts to flood victims in Penampang", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVib3JuZW9wb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzAxLzE3L2thcGF5YW4tcmVwLXVyZ2VzLXN0YXRlLWdvdmVybm1lbnQtdG8tZXhwZWRpdGUtYWlkLWVmZm9ydHMtdG8tZmxvb2QtdmljdGltcy1pbi1wZW5hbXBhbmcv0gEA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2021/01/WhatsApp-Image-2021-01-17-at-13.02.58.jpeg", "text": "KOTA KINABALU (Jan 17): Kapayan assemblywoman Jannie Lasimbang urges the Gabungan Rakyat Sabah (GRS) state government to expedite efforts to send assistance to those affected by the flood in Penampang and other districts.\n\nJannie also urged the government to continue to source for funds for the flood mitigation project in Penampang.\n\nJannie in a statement today said she was saddened to see Donggongon township and surrounding villages like Kampung Hungab, Kampung Tunoh, Bundusan as well as a few housing estates there flooded again.\n\n\u201cDuring my time in government, I have tried to find a solution to the flooding problem.

Here, crop losses have been unavoidable as many sections of the fields have been under 2ft to 3ft of water for two to three weeks,\u201d said Carl Bek-Nielsen, chief executive (CEO) of United Plantations Bhd.\n\n\u201cThis adversely affects the ability to enter the fields and harvest the crop, let alone bring out the crop as fields are under water.\u201d\n\nIn Sarawak, Malaysia\u2019s second-biggest palm growing state, the drop in yields may be more severe than the 15% to 20% initially estimated over the next two months, according to Andrew Cheng, CEO of the Sarawak Oil Palm Plantation Owners Association.\n\nThat is because the acute worker shortage compounds production problems caused by floodwaters which have inundated plantations and interrupted harvesting, he said.\n\n\u201cI believe many oil palm plantations in Sarawak\u2019s lower-lying areas will be affected, especially with the King Tide coming in,\u201d Cheng said, referring to an especially high tide, which may lead to prolonged flooding.\n\n\u201cDue to the Covid-19 pandemic and the movement control order, we are unable to assess the overall situation.\u201d Sarawak makes up about 21% of the country\u2019s total palm oil output.\n\nBreaking point\n\nMalaysia\u2019s shortage of palm oil workers has become \u201cmuch, much worse\u201d compared with six months ago, and was likely responsible for up to 90% of the 3.6 million tonnes of fresh fruit bunches lost last year, Bek-Nielsen said.\n\n\u201cWe are at a breaking point that will result in considerable crop losses in 2021,\u201d he said. While first quarter production will not be much lower than last quarter, the impact from the acute labour shortage \u201cwill really start to bite and impact production from April to October\u201d, leading to a drop in output this year to 18.6 million tonnes. Output was 19.14 million tonnes in 2020.\n\nTo relieve the shortage of foreign workers, planters are seeking government approval for a safe way to bring guest workers into Malaysia, where all Covid-19 testing and quarantine costs are borne by employers, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, FGV Holdings Bhd, one of the country\u2019s biggest producers, said about 3,600ha in Pahang, Johor, Perak, Negeri Sembilan and Sabah were affected by flash floods, although there is no serious impact to field operations and mills are running as usual despite a drop in daily volumes.\n\nStill, there will be a \u201cslight impact on yield production due to weather affecting labour productivity in January and in the first quarter\u201d, it said in emailed responses. \u201cWe estimate the potential reduction in yields to be about 20% for January as compared with the earlier month, and by almost 20% in 1Q from the earlier period.\u201d\n\nIn Indonesia, the world\u2019s top producer, plantations have not been affected by the recent flooding in South Kalimantan, according to the Indonesian Palm Oil Association, or Gapki.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["oil", "labour", "crop", "whammy", "double", "floods", "output",

EU-Malaysia Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Eurocham Malaysia) via Malay Mail\n\nAll Malaysian states (except Sarawak) are currently under Movement Control Order (MCO) until 4th February.\n\nMOH predicts 5,000 daily new infections the week after Chinese New Year\n\nHealth Director-General Tan Sri Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah released data showing the infection rate of Covid-19 or (R0/ Rt) as of 22nd January at 1.09.\n\nBut if the R0 increases to 1.2, MOH forecasts 5,000 daily new cases in the third week of February, followed by 8,000 daily new cases in the third week of March.\n\nThe third week of February coincides with the end of Chinese New Year, but the occasion is unlikely to affect the case numbers as interstate travel and social gatherings are currently banned.\n\nKadar kebolehjangkitan Covid-19 atau Ro/Rt pada jangkaan mengikut kes seharian pada 22 Januari 2021 untuk seluruh negara adalah 1.09.

Government buses leave daily from Shimla to Kalpa, so that can be your budget option.\n\nIf you want comfort, then you can hire a chauffeur-driven car instead. Another alternative is to rent a car from Chandigarh and drive yourself.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nKalpa has a few hotels and many homestay options, such as the Fort-View Homestay and The Village View Homestay.\n\nBoth were very nice and cosy experiences with wonderful views, so do choose whichever suits you.\n\nWhere to eat\n\nThere are no good restaurants, although you can try dining in at Echor. There are two or three restaurants here that are, frankly, quite expensive yet not up to the mark.\n\nThat being said, your best bet will be to eat at your homestay or hotel restaurant.\n\nThings to do\n\nYou can explore all the nooks and corners of this small town within two whole days as Kalpa is a small village with few things to do.\n\nHowever, don\u2019t let that stop you from enjoying the atmosphere and the mood.\n\nHere are some places you can visit:\n\nChandalika Temple\n\nChandalika Devi temple is done in beautiful Himachali architecture and offers a gorgeous view of Kinnau Kailash at sunrise.\n\nKalpa Monastery\n\nOne must visit this peaceful Buddhist monastery at Kalpa. The chants in the evenings and mornings add to the ambiance of this town.\n\nSuicide Point\n\nSuicide Point is 5km away from the town, so if you\u2019re looking for that perfect cliffside Instagram picture, this is the place for it.\n\nVillage tour\n\nKalpa is a self-sustaining village with a lot of organic farming activity going on. You can take a stroll to the farm or visit the old heritage houses in and around the village.\n\nApple Orchard tour\n\nKalpa has many apple orchards and if you are visiting during the harvest season, which is around August or October, be sure to visit them.\n\nAmit and Anindita are Indian Travel bloggers who blog at Travel Like We Do.

Azrul Mohd Khalib\n\nThere is an alarming emerging trend of resident associations and condominium managements requiring the disclosure of confidential medical information related to the Covid-19 status of people living in their neighbourhood.\n\nThere are demands for PCR or antigen test results, copies of passports and pictures of those who are positive. Most are aimed at foreigners. Residents are encouraged to inform on their neighbours. All being done supposedly in the name of collective protection, safety, and security.\n\nThis is a challenging and uncertain time for everyone.\n\nWith daily new Covid-19 numbers reaching record numbers, no peak in sight to the third wave, and more people in our communities, workplaces and families becoming infected, it is natural that we become increasingly fearful and insecure, not just for ourselves but also our loved ones.\n\nThe threat of death and disease, coupled with the general lack of knowledge of how Covid-19 spreads, and the need to blame someone for the pain and suffering that we see among those infected and affected, have led to a cloud of stigma.\n\nStigma now surrounds Covid-19, the people and communities who have contracted the disease. It is causing prejudice, discrimination, and xenophobia, widening inequalities, increasing vulnerabilities to violence, harassment and ostracisation, and hampering public health measures intended to manage the epidemic.\n\nThere are increasing reports of people and families who have recovered from infection or been released from home isolation or quarantine, being marginalised, or ostracised by their neighbours, family members, communities, and even loved ones, resulting in additional anxiety, and falling into depression.\n\nPeople have been blamed for supposedly bringing Covid-19 into housing areas and condominium complexes. Fingers were pointed at migrant workers when they were disproportionately represented in the daily statistics, which led to crackdowns by authorities, and caused fear and anxiety among even documented foreigners.\n\nFormer patients have lost jobs after their recovery. Families have been told to leave their rented homes. Tragically, out of a sense of overwhelming shame and fear of being a burden to their loved ones, some patients have recently taken their own lives. The list of consequences due to Covid-19-related stigma goes on.\n\nAll around the world, for those who have worked on AIDS for the past four decades, this sounds altogether too familiar. The same challenges, problems and harm of stigma and discrimination seen in that epidemic are manifesting themselves in the Covid-19 pandemic. But amid the ongoing tragedy, there is an opportunity.\n\nWe can apply what we have learnt from 40 years of the HIV-AIDS epidemic to what is happening today, in order to address the Covid-19 stigma. We do not need to repeat the same mistakes. We should not lose more lives through abuse, harm and suffering caused by Covid-19 prejudice and discrimination.\n\nIn our fear and frustration, we must resist adopting draconian measures that degrade or compromise on human rights and dignity.\n\nPast successful responses to public health emergencies have demonstrated repeatedly the value of grounding them in human rights.\n\nWe have learnt the hard way from the HIV-AIDS epidemic, that approaches which depend on punitive measures, shaming and discrimination undermine public health objectives and eventually fail in the long run. They end up doing more harm than good.\n\nSolidarity, empathy, and compassion reduce suffering, protect public health and save lives.\n\nNew Zealand has shown that when empathy and compassion are coupled with competence and firmness, the Covid-19 outbreak can be managed effectively and decisively.\n\nHumanise Covid-19 pandemic\n\nTo address Covid-19 stigma, we can do better in four areas.\n\nFirstly, we must humanise the Covid-19 pandemic. Today, the people and lives who have been touched by this disease are almost entirely represented by the health ministry\u2019s daily reported numbers of those infected, recovered, needing intensive care, placed on ventilator support, and who have died.\n\nThe human face of Malaysia\u2019s response to the outbreak is largely missing from these statistics.\n\nAside from what is shared online in social media, there are barely any stories in the mainstream media of people and their lived experiences of being infected and surviving, of the lives that have been lost. This has contributed to the fear, misinformation and stigma surrounding Covid-19.\n\nThe right to confidentiality and privacy of medical information should be protected. However, there are many who are willing and have volunteered to share their experiences, as patients, caregivers, emergency services and healthcare workers.\n\nGiving an opportunity for stories to be broadcast, especially those that are positive and uplifting, will go a long way in dealing with the ignorance and misunderstanding surrounding the disease and towards building a Covid-19 response that is free from stigma and discrimination.\n\nHealthcare workers, who have been at the forefront of the response to this public health emergency for a year now, have resorted to either posting on social media or covertly sharing their pain, suffering and frustrations with trusted media outlets.\n\nMany hope that by doing so, they would inform the public about what is happening in our hospitals and healthcare facilities, the day-to-day realities, and possibly gain public support and empathy.\n\nThe fact that they are forced to do so, often in a discreet manner largely to protect themselves from official repercussions, is a disservice to the sacrifices that they and their families have made. They should not have to do this. We need to highlight their stories in the media, listen to their appeals and respond to their requests for assistance.\n\nSecondly, we need to correct negative language that can fuel fear and stigma. We must avoid the use of stereotypical, negative expressions that can create or increase stigma, and focus on inclusive language.\n\nCommunities at risk or vulnerable to Covid-19 infection have been described as time bombs, fuelling fear and suspicion. Contracting Covid-19 does not mean someone has less value than anyone else.\n\nThe migrant worker community, for example, despite their obvious vulnerability and lack of adequate efforts to protect them, has been unfairly blamed for the outbreak, especially in the third wave.\n\nThirdly, a lesson learnt from people living with HIV is that: \u201cIf you take away our jobs, you will kill us faster than the virus.\u201d\n\nIn our response to dealing with Covid-19, we need to also protect jobs and people\u2019s livelihoods. Covid-19 and the resulting lockdowns have caused tremendous and unprecedented economic turmoil and impacted thousands of households.\n\nDue to lockdowns and closure of economic activities, it has deprived people of livelihoods and caused many families to slip closer towards or deeper into poverty. It is essential that those affected by Covid-19 face no stigma in returning to their jobs. Workers should not fear that they might lose their jobs if they test positive for Covid-19.\n\nPunitive laws do not work\n\nFinally, a key lesson from the HIV response is that exclusion and punitive laws do not work.\n\nEvery day, from the start of the first movement control order, we have heard how many people have been fined or arrested for SOP violations. Rather than contribute towards reductions in the number of people being infected with Covid-19, what it has achieved instead, is create an atmosphere of fear and resentment towards authorities especially with the appearance of double standards.\n\nMany, particularly those from lower income backgrounds have become victims of subjective enforcement.\n\nWith the number of new Covid-19 cases reaching record numbers, this emphasis on a punitive approach to disease prevention and control should be reviewed.\n\nThis is a public health emergency, not a war. There are no winners or losers, good sides or bad sides.\n\nIn this public health crisis, we need to look to our common humanity. Anyone can get infected during this global pandemic. Covid-19 does not discriminate, and neither should our response.\n\nWe should treat the individuals and communities affected by Covid-19 the same way how we would wish ourselves to be treated, with empathy and compassion. Government, community leaders and public health officials can lead by example and help prevent stigma and discrimination.\n\nNo one is safe until we are all safe, and stopping stigma is critical to making our communities safer and healthier. We need to work together to prevent and address stigma.\n\nAzrul Mohd Khalib is the head of Galen Centre for Health & Social Policy and is an FMT reader.\n\nThe views expressed are those of the writer

published on the Federal Government Gazette\u2019s website lists 52 items under essential services, instead of 50 items in the January 15 gazette.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s what has changed in the latest list of essential services that can operate during MCO 2.0:\n\nInternet, postal, courier, broadcasting, call centre now specified\n\nIn the January 15 list (old), telecommunications and information technology were grouped together as item 28, but this category of services has been made more detailed in the latest January 21 list (new) by splitting them into item 28 and item 29 and adding new specific services such as call centres and internet services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOld: 28. Telecommunication and digital infrastructures including information and communication technology services and global business services\n\nNew: 28. Communications including telecommunications and internet, postal and courier, and broadcasting\n\n29. Information technology including global business services and call centre\n\nSlight change for e-commerce detail\n\nThe new list includes a slight tweak to the old list in the e-commerce item.\n\nOld: 29. E-commerce including e-marketplace, digital payment and local e-commerce internet centre services\n\nNew: 30: E-commerce including e-marketplace, digital payment and local e-commerce services centre\n\nNew category added on\n\nThis item was not mentioned in the old list.\n\nNew: 31. Digital creative content development in studio including film editing\n\nBoth the old and new lists contain a catch-all phrase of \u201cAny service, work, industry of business as determined by the Minister of Health after consulting the authority that regulates the services, work, industry and business\u201d, which essentially means that any businesses not included in the gazetted list of essential services may still be allowed to operate if the health minister decides that they can operate.\n\nThe new gazetted list takes effect on January 22, and applies to the whole of Malaysia except Sarawak \u2014 Johor, Kedah, Kelantan, Melaka, Negri Sembilan, Pahang, Penang, Perak, Perlis, Sabah, Selangor, Terengganu, Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya, Labuan \u2014 until February 2 which is when MCO is due to end. The new list also applies to Sibu in Sarawak where the MCO is scheduled to end January 29.\n\nThis is not the first time that the government has made changes to the list of essential services allowed to operate during MCO 2.0.\n\nThe Ministry of International Trade and Industry had on January 12 afternoon released a list of essential services for MCO 2.0 that included automotive manufacturing and after-sales services, but updated the list the same evening by removing that exemption and only listing automotive repair and maintenance as an essential service.\n\nThe government in MCO regulations gazetted on January 12 listed the manufacturing and production of \u201cautomotive equipment\u201d as an essential service but did not include automotive repair and maintenance.\n\nThe January 15 gazetted list of essential services updated this to be the manufacturing and production of \u201cautomotive (vehicles and components)\u201d instead of the \u201cautomotive equipment\u201d previously listed, while also adding \u201cautomotive (maintenance and repair)\u201d as a separate business under the services category that is allowed to continue to operate.\n\nThe changes in the list of essential services had resulted in carmakers Hondo, Toyota and Perodua briefly stopping activities in their factories in Malaysia, before resuming operations again.\n\nWhere to get the latest information\n\nIf you are a business owner and want to know about the latest rules, guidelines, standard operating procedures or frequently-asked questions issued by Miti, there is a dedicated section on the ministry\u2019s website with such MCO-related information (https://www.miti.gov.my/redir/pkp/pkp.html).\n\nHowever when Malay Mail visited the Miti website section dedicated to MCO information at around noon on Thursday, various editions \u2014 both old and new \u2014 of the list of essential services were found on the website.\n\nThis dedicated section has six sections: Media release, FAQs, SOPs and gazette, infographic, CIMS 3.0 tutorial video, and email enquiry.\n\nThe FAQ document in the FAQ section which was issued on January 12 by Miti in Bahasa Malaysia, comes with a list of essential services written in Bahasa Malaysia dated January 12.\n\nIn the media release section, a media release in English and issued on January 12 comes with a list of essential services written in English which was updated as of January 16 and sourced from the January 15 gazetted list.\n\nThe infographics section of the site carries two sets of slides or infographics \u2014 one in Bahasa Malaysia and another in English \u2014 on the list of essential services, with this based also on the January 15 gazetted list.\n\nAlso included in the infographics section is a set of slides dated January 20 of the list of 16 businesses allowed by the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) to operate during the MCO, with this list written in Bahasa Malaysia: Shopping complexes or malls, supermarkets and hypermarkets, departmental stores, pharmacies or selling of personal care products, convenience stores or mini marts, laundry shops (not including self-service laundromats), restaurants, furniture stores, jewellery shops, electrics and electronics stores, bookshops and stationery shops, hardware stores, pet food, vehicle workshops or maintenance or spare parts, vehicle sales and distribution centres, speciality retail stores at petrol stations.\n\n(On January 12, senior minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob when announcing the government\u2019s rules for areas under MCO had said that laundry shops except for self-service laundromats will be allowed to operate from 6am to 8pm. Following public complaints, Ismail Sabri however on January 14 said self-service laundromats will also be allowed to operate during MCO, with the condition that a worker is present to ensure physical distancing and check customers\u2019 body temperature. Although optometrists were not included in KPDNHEP\u2019s initial list, the government on January 15 confirmed that they were now allowed by the KPDNHEP to open during MCO based on tighter SOPs.)\n\nIn the SOPs and gazette section on Miti\u2019s MCO site, clicking on the federal gazette would lead to the latest January 21 government gazette containing the latest list of essential services, while the SOPs posted is also the latest National Security Council\u2019s general SOPs for MCO areas which is dated January 21.\n\nAs of noon yesterday, Miti\u2019s Facebook and Twitter accounts have yet to post information regarding the updated details in the gazetted list of essential services allowed to operate.\n\nAs for Sarawak (except for Sibu) which is under the conditional movement control order (CMCO) until January 31, the latest CMCO regulations gazetted by the federal government on January 21 maintains the list of prohibited activities that had been in use in previous editions of CMCO rules.\n\nThe list of prohibited activities under CMCO are: Outbound tour activities by Malaysians and inbound tour activities involving foreign tourists except foreign tourists from countries specified by the health minister, activities in pubs and nightclubs except for restaurant business in pubs and nightclubs, and any activity with many people attending at a place which makes it difficult to carry out physical distancing and to comply with the health director-general\u2019s directions. \u2015 Malay Mail\n\nRelated reading", "keyword": ["operate",

We didn\u2019t really know where we were. We just wanted to run away,\u201d Diana tells FMT, recounting the horrific day.\n\nDiana and Dorothy had spent nearly all their lives in a children\u2019s home in Buntong, but after being caught recording the bullying and emotional abuse kids at the home faced, they had been sent away.\n\nThe girls said the home\u2019s caretaker sent them away at night to \u201clive with their father\u201d, a person they\u2019ve never even met, in a shack in a rural village in Batu Gajah.\n\nAt the house, they said, bottles of cheap liquor were strewn on the floor, and Diana says the man they were told was their father was drunk and slurring. Another foreign couple lived in the house too.\n\nFortunately, nothing untoward happened that night. The next day, the two girls told their \u201cfather\u201d they were going to a nearby sundry shop and ran off to tell passers-by of their plight. They were put in touch with an NGO that helped people in distress.\n\nThe NGO called Persatuan Harapan India Malaysia came to the girls\u2019 rescue after being told of their ordeal, and the plight others faced at the children\u2019s home.\n\nM Manimaran, the group\u2019s president, said he was shocked to hear what was happening in the children\u2019s home, and since then, has managed to rescue six children and placed them in another home.\n\nFMT is withholding the name of the home pending a comment from its management.\n\nManimaran has also lodged a police report and filed a complaint with the Welfare Department.\n\nDiana says children at the home are often bullied and scolded by the caretakers.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of kind people who donate things to the home, but these items get taken away. We are also threatened against speaking about what happens at the home.\u201d\n\nThey claimed the children are also being given Christian names and are forced to attend activities at a church.\n\nA pair of sisters rescued from the home, Salvander Kaur Vikram Singh, 17 and Elvina Kaur, 14, also spoke of their traumatic experiences at the home.\n\nThe girls from Johor were sent to the children\u2019s home as their parents could not afford to provide them a good education.\n\n\u201cMy sister and I were threatened that if we did not obey (what the caretakers demanded), they would cut our hair short.\u201d Sikh men and women do not cut their hair, as part of their practice.\n\n\u201cThey forced us to go to church and pray. If we refused, they would threaten to call our parents. There are times our parents did call but they could not speak to us because they were told we were busy studying or not around, when in fact we were there.\u201d\n\nElvina actually had her hair cut short as punishment for refusing to listen to a caretaker\u2019s demands.\n\n\u201cNow my sister and I are no longer there, we are happy.

It is still being reviewed,\u201d he said.\n\nBased on social media postings and a quick survey done by The Malaysian Reserve (TMR), many are of the opinion that the shorter operating hours of eateries during the MCO has increased the burden of the rakyat.\n\nRestoran Mahsuri owner Afnan Aiman said the move to allow businesses, eateries and shops to only operate from 6am to 8pm has caused more hardship to the rakyat, instead of helping them.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s not okay. Businesses have been a little slow because now we can\u2019t dine in and time is too limited because people would usually finish work at 6pm or much later, and by the time they reach home, there\u2019s not enough time to buy food because we\u2019re already closed.\n\n\u201cWhen this happens, it affects our businesses and sales have been shrinking,\u201d he told TMR.\n\nHe said if operating hours can be extended until 10pm, all restaurant operators will feel a little relieved and satisfied because most of them have more sales at night.\n\n\u201cAny restaurant, they depend more on customers who come at night. If the government is willing to extend the time, 10pm is already okay for us.\u201d\n\nAfnan also opined that the country\u2019s political instability has put a great weight on businesses, making people\u2019s lives more difficult than it already is.\n\n\u201cWe know Covid-19 is dangerous, why would the politicians want to take advantage at a time like this by holding elections and asking people to choose leaders?\n\n\u201cTo me, all of that is unnecessary. They should solve this problem first before their politics. If they can\u2019t help us, don\u2019t help us.\u201d\n\nKedai Kopi Payung owner Nor Baizura Jamil told TMR the operating hours were pleasant at first as it gives time for her to close shop early and rest.\n\n\u201cBut from an economic standpoint, sales have been down to half of what we made before. We have experienced a lot of our customers trying to come and buy food around 6pm or before we close.\u201d\n\nShe also believes that it is better to extend the operating hours so that businesses can run accordingly to reach its sales targets and customers will not feel distressed.\n\nThe situation has caused quite the stir on Twitter when the hashtag #SiBodohKauDengarSini, which translates to \u201cListen here, idiot\u201d, became a trending topic recently.\n\nIt all started when user @farhanazahan complained about not having dinner two nights in a row and that he faced problems while ordering food even though he placed an early order at 5pm.\n\nHe also tweeted that compared to Ismail Sabri, he does not have a maid to serve food at home when he gets back from work.\n\nAnother user @puterirajaawan replied that she \u201cdoes not understand people who create problems out of everything\u201d.\n\nShe suggested ordering the food early to store it in the fridge and reheat it the next day.\n\nThis elicited a response from @yarafaee_ whose tweet started with \u201cSi bodoh, kau dengar sini\u201d before elaborating that food delivery platforms are facing technical problems to fulfil substantial orders during a short window.\n\n\u201cPeople who got back from work do not have time to cook because they have to get up early the next day to go back to work.\u201d\n\nShe also tweeted \u201cinstead of telling the rakyat to find a way, why not ask the government to extend operating hours?\u201d", "keyword": ["govt", "problems", "hours", "early", "closing", "8pm", "instead", "short", "extend", "operating", "reconsiders", "sales", "food", "businesses"], "summary": "Based on social media postings and a quick survey done by The Malaysian Reserve (TMR), many are of the opinion that the shorter operating hours of eateries during the MCO has increased the burden of the rakyat.\nRestoran Mahsuri owner Afnan Aiman said the move to allow businesses, eateries and shops to only operate from 6am to 8pm has caused more hardship to the rakyat, instead of helping them.\n\u201cWhen this happens, it affects our businesses and sales have been shrinking,\u201d he told TMR.\nHe said if operating hours can be extended until 10pm, all restaurant operators will feel a little relieved and satisfied because most of them have more sales at night.\nShe suggested ordering the food early to store it in the fridge and reheat it the next day.", "news": "The Malaysian Reserve", "date": "2021-01-20 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Kapayan rep urges state government to expedite aid efforts to flood victims in Penampang", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVib3JuZW9wb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzAxLzE3L2thcGF5YW4tcmVwLXVyZ2VzLXN0YXRlLWdvdmVybm1lbnQtdG8tZXhwZWRpdGUtYWlkLWVmZm9ydHMtdG8tZmxvb2QtdmljdGltcy1pbi1wZW5hbXBhbmcv0gEA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2021/01/WhatsApp-Image-2021-01-17-at-13.02.58.jpeg", "text": "KOTA KINABALU (Jan 17): Kapayan assemblywoman Jannie Lasimbang urges the Gabungan Rakyat Sabah (GRS) state government to expedite efforts to send assistance to those affected by the flood in Penampang and other districts.\n\nJannie also urged the government to continue to source for funds for the flood mitigation project in Penampang.\n\nJannie in a statement today said she was saddened to see Donggongon township and surrounding villages like Kampung Hungab, Kampung Tunoh, Bundusan as well as a few housing estates there flooded again.\n\n\u201cDuring my time in government, I have tried to find a solution to the flooding problem.

Here, crop losses have been unavoidable as many sections of the fields have been under 2ft to 3ft of water for two to three weeks,\u201d said Carl Bek-Nielsen, chief executive (CEO) of United Plantations Bhd.\n\n\u201cThis adversely affects the ability to enter the fields and harvest the crop, let alone bring out the crop as fields are under water.\u201d\n\nIn Sarawak, Malaysia\u2019s second-biggest palm growing state, the drop in yields may be more severe than the 15% to 20% initially estimated over the next two months, according to Andrew Cheng, CEO of the Sarawak Oil Palm Plantation Owners Association.\n\nThat is because the acute worker shortage compounds production problems caused by floodwaters which have inundated plantations and interrupted harvesting, he said.\n\n\u201cI believe many oil palm plantations in Sarawak\u2019s lower-lying areas will be affected, especially with the King Tide coming in,\u201d Cheng said, referring to an especially high tide, which may lead to prolonged flooding.\n\n\u201cDue to the Covid-19 pandemic and the movement control order, we are unable to assess the overall situation.\u201d Sarawak makes up about 21% of the country\u2019s total palm oil output.\n\nBreaking point\n\nMalaysia\u2019s shortage of palm oil workers has become \u201cmuch, much worse\u201d compared with six months ago, and was likely responsible for up to 90% of the 3.6 million tonnes of fresh fruit bunches lost last year, Bek-Nielsen said.\n\n\u201cWe are at a breaking point that will result in considerable crop losses in 2021,\u201d he said. While first quarter production will not be much lower than last quarter, the impact from the acute labour shortage \u201cwill really start to bite and impact production from April to October\u201d, leading to a drop in output this year to 18.6 million tonnes. Output was 19.14 million tonnes in 2020.\n\nTo relieve the shortage of foreign workers, planters are seeking government approval for a safe way to bring guest workers into Malaysia, where all Covid-19 testing and quarantine costs are borne by employers, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, FGV Holdings Bhd, one of the country\u2019s biggest producers, said about 3,600ha in Pahang, Johor, Perak, Negeri Sembilan and Sabah were affected by flash floods, although there is no serious impact to field operations and mills are running as usual despite a drop in daily volumes.\n\nStill, there will be a \u201cslight impact on yield production due to weather affecting labour productivity in January and in the first quarter\u201d, it said in emailed responses. \u201cWe estimate the potential reduction in yields to be about 20% for January as compared with the earlier month, and by almost 20% in 1Q from the earlier period.\u201d\n\nIn Indonesia, the world\u2019s top producer, plantations have not been affected by the recent flooding in South Kalimantan, according to the Indonesian Palm Oil Association, or Gapki.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["oil", "labour", "crop", "whammy", "double", "floods", "output",

those responsible are held accountable.\n\n\u201cWe are of the opinion that, if Suhakam\u2019s findings are consistent with what the families are claiming, then they should be used as an additional

figures, and must involve a collective effort with a variety of groups.\n\nSuaram lamented the limits that have been placed on Suhakam\u2019s powers by the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia Act 1999, which it says has long \u201chobbled\u201d the institution.\n\nOne example that has been openly debated over the last week is Section 12(2), which stops the commission from inquiring into any complaint once it is before a judicial inquiry, which Suaram said had been the reason for a number of prior investigations being dropped.\n\n\u201cCivil societies have always addressed the inadequacies of the Act and pushed Suhakam to address human rights violations in a broader sense and push the boundaries within its restricted mandate and powers.\u201d\n\nRecently, the non-governmental organisation Eliminating Deaths and Abuse in Custody Together (EDICT) had told Suhakam to stop its inquiries into custodial deaths after it said G Jestus Kevin had died as a result of blunt force trauma.\n\nEDICT claimed that inquiries into custodial death did not come under Suhakam\u2019s purview.\n\nHowever, Suhakam commissioner Mah Weng Kwai insisted that they have the power to investigate any allegation that comes to their attention as long as the matter is not in court, with Suhakam\u2019s investigation into the Jestus case concluding in April, before the matter went to

radius allowed by the government.\n\nIn the incident shared on We Are Malaysian Facebook page, the original poster (OP) said she had ventured out from her home at around 10 am on Sunday (24 Jan) to buy groceries. On her way out, she was stopped by police at a roadblock.\n\n\u201cPolice officer told me \u201cTak logic. U Bagitau Waze itu tepat tak?\u201d\n\nOP explained to the police officers that she was going out to buy food and groceries nearby, adding that she had checked Waze and confirmed that the journey was within 10 km radius of her house.\n\nOP shared in the post that this was her first time being stopped for such an issue at a roadblock, adding that she was completely speechless and confused.\n\nIf Waze is not tepat (accurate) I\u2019ve no idea which is tepat other than Google.

The chants in the evenings and mornings add to the ambiance of this town.\n\nSuicide Point\n\nSuicide Point is 5km away from the town, so if you\u2019re looking for that perfect cliffside Instagram picture, this is the place for it.\n\nVillage tour\n\nKalpa is a self-sustaining village with a lot of organic farming activity going on. You can take a stroll to the farm or visit the old heritage houses in and around the village.\n\nApple Orchard tour\n\nKalpa has many apple orchards and if you are visiting during the harvest season, which is around August or October, be sure to visit them.\n\nAmit and Anindita are Indian Travel bloggers who blog at Travel Like We Do.

Azrul Mohd Khalib\n\nThere is an alarming emerging trend of resident associations and condominium managements requiring the disclosure of confidential medical information related to the Covid-19 status of people living in their neighbourhood.\n\nThere are demands for PCR or antigen test results, copies of passports and pictures of those who are positive. Most are aimed at foreigners. Residents are encouraged to inform on their neighbours. All being done supposedly in the name of collective protection, safety, and security.\n\nThis is a challenging and uncertain time for everyone.\n\nWith daily new Covid-19 numbers reaching record numbers, no peak in sight to the third wave, and more people in our communities, workplaces and families becoming infected, it is natural that we become increasingly fearful and insecure, not just for ourselves but also our loved ones.\n\nThe threat of death and disease, coupled with the general lack of knowledge of how Covid-19 spreads, and the need to blame someone for the pain and suffering that we see among those infected and affected, have led to a cloud of stigma.\n\nStigma now surrounds Covid-19, the people and communities who have contracted the disease. It is causing prejudice, discrimination, and xenophobia, widening inequalities, increasing vulnerabilities to violence, harassment and ostracisation, and hampering public health measures intended to manage the epidemic.\n\nThere are increasing reports of people and families who have recovered from infection or been released from home isolation or quarantine, being marginalised, or ostracised by their neighbours, family members, communities, and even loved ones, resulting in additional anxiety, and falling into depression.\n\nPeople have been blamed for supposedly bringing Covid-19 into housing areas and condominium complexes. Fingers were pointed at migrant workers when they were disproportionately represented in the daily statistics, which led to crackdowns by authorities, and caused fear and anxiety among even documented foreigners.\n\nFormer patients have lost jobs after their recovery. Families have been told to leave their rented homes. Tragically, out of a sense of overwhelming shame and fear of being a burden to their loved ones, some patients have recently taken their own lives. The list of consequences due to Covid-19-related stigma goes on.\n\nAll around the world, for those who have worked on AIDS for the past four decades, this sounds altogether too familiar. The same challenges, problems and harm of stigma and discrimination seen in that epidemic are manifesting themselves in the Covid-19 pandemic. But amid the ongoing tragedy, there is an opportunity.\n\nWe can apply what we have learnt from 40 years of the HIV-AIDS epidemic to what is happening today, in order to address the Covid-19 stigma. We do not need to repeat the same mistakes. We should not lose more lives through abuse, harm and suffering caused by Covid-19 prejudice and discrimination.\n\nIn our fear and frustration, we must resist adopting draconian measures that degrade or compromise on human rights and dignity.\n\nPast successful responses to public health emergencies have demonstrated repeatedly the value of grounding them in human rights.\n\nWe have learnt the hard way from the HIV-AIDS epidemic, that approaches which depend on punitive measures, shaming and discrimination undermine public health objectives and eventually fail in the long run. They end up doing more harm than good.\n\nSolidarity, empathy, and compassion reduce suffering, protect public health and save lives.\n\nNew Zealand has shown that when empathy and compassion are coupled with competence and firmness, the Covid-19 outbreak can be managed effectively and decisively.\n\nHumanise Covid-19 pandemic\n\nTo address Covid-19 stigma, we can do better in four areas.\n\nFirstly, we must humanise the Covid-19 pandemic. Today, the people and lives who have been touched by this disease are almost entirely represented by the health ministry\u2019s daily reported numbers of those infected, recovered, needing intensive care, placed on ventilator support, and who have died.\n\nThe human face of Malaysia\u2019s response to the outbreak is largely missing from these statistics.\n\nAside from what is shared online in social media, there are barely any stories in the mainstream media of people and their lived experiences of being infected and surviving, of the lives that have been lost. This has contributed to the fear, misinformation and stigma surrounding Covid-19.\n\nThe right to confidentiality and privacy of medical information should be protected. However, there are many who are willing and have volunteered to share their experiences, as patients, caregivers, emergency services and healthcare workers.\n\nGiving an opportunity for stories to be broadcast, especially those that are positive and uplifting, will go a long way in dealing with the ignorance and misunderstanding surrounding the disease and towards building a Covid-19 response that is free from stigma and discrimination.\n\nHealthcare workers, who have been at the forefront of the response to this public health emergency for a year now, have resorted to either posting on social media or covertly sharing their pain, suffering and frustrations with trusted media outlets.\n\nMany hope that by doing so, they would inform the public about what is happening in our hospitals and healthcare facilities, the day-to-day realities, and possibly gain public support and empathy.\n\nThe fact that they are forced to do so, often in a discreet manner largely to protect themselves from official repercussions, is a disservice to the sacrifices that they and their families have made. They should not have to do this. We need to highlight their stories in the media, listen to their appeals and respond to their requests for assistance.\n\nSecondly, we need to correct negative language that can fuel fear and stigma. We must avoid the use of stereotypical, negative expressions that can create or increase stigma, and focus on inclusive language.\n\nCommunities at risk or vulnerable to Covid-19 infection have been described as time bombs, fuelling fear and suspicion. Contracting Covid-19 does not mean someone has less value than anyone else.\n\nThe migrant worker community, for example, despite their obvious vulnerability and lack of adequate efforts to protect them, has been unfairly blamed for the outbreak, especially in the third wave.\n\nThirdly, a lesson learnt from people living with HIV is that: \u201cIf you take away our jobs, you will kill us faster than the virus.\u201d\n\nIn our response to dealing with Covid-19, we need to also protect jobs and people\u2019s livelihoods. Covid-19 and the resulting lockdowns have caused tremendous and unprecedented economic turmoil and impacted thousands of households.\n\nDue to lockdowns and closure of economic activities, it has deprived people of livelihoods and caused many families to slip closer towards or deeper into poverty. It is essential that those affected by Covid-19 face no stigma in returning to their jobs. Workers should not fear that they might lose their jobs if they test positive for Covid-19.\n\nPunitive laws do not work\n\nFinally, a key lesson from the HIV response is that exclusion and punitive laws do not work.\n\nEvery day, from the start of the first movement control order, we have heard how many people have been fined or arrested for SOP violations. Rather than contribute towards reductions in the number of people being infected with Covid-19, what it has achieved instead, is create an atmosphere of fear and resentment towards authorities especially with the appearance of double standards.\n\nMany, particularly those from lower income backgrounds have become victims of subjective enforcement.\n\nWith the number of new Covid-19 cases reaching record numbers, this emphasis on a punitive approach to disease prevention and control should be reviewed.\n\nThis is a public health emergency, not a war. There are no winners or losers, good sides or bad sides.\n\nIn this public health crisis, we need to look to our common humanity. Anyone can get infected during this global pandemic. Covid-19 does not discriminate, and neither should our response.\n\nWe should treat the individuals and communities affected by Covid-19 the same way how we would wish ourselves to be treated, with empathy and compassion. Government, community leaders and public health officials can lead by example and help prevent stigma and discrimination.\n\nNo one is safe until we are all safe, and stopping stigma is critical to making our communities safer and healthier. We need to work together to prevent and address stigma.\n\nAzrul Mohd Khalib is the head of Galen Centre for Health & Social Policy and is an FMT reader.\n\nThe views expressed are those of the writer

The next few years will decide whether Samsung will become, say, a global platform company or remain a hardware company,\u201d he said.\n\nLee, 52, has been the de facto head of Samsung Electronics since his father, Lee Kun-hee, was hospitalised after a heart attack in 2014.\n\nThe elder Lee died in October, but the chairmanship he held has yet to be filled, and uncertainty cast by his son\u2019s legal troubles was the chief reason, analysts said.\n\nVice-chairman since 2012, Lee has yet to make a mark \u2013 as his father did \u2013 by building the semiconductor business, which now brings in half of Samsung Electronics profits.\n\nAmid the moves meant to ensure his succession, Lee has fought against allegations of legal wrongdoing, including a year in prison in 2017-2018 over a bribery case involving impeached President Park Geun-hye.\n\nFlagship businesses\n\nOne of Lee\u2019s focuses is Samsung\u2019s non-memory chip business, including chip contract manufacturing, calling on the staff to \u201ccreate another legend\u201d.\n\nSamsung plans to invest US$121.47 billion in non-memory chips through 2030 to become No 1, including in chip contract manufacturing, where its 17% market share is a distant second to current No 1 TSMC\u2019s 54%, according to TrendForce.\n\nSamsung has also touted Lee\u2019s deal-making skills in winning a US$6.6 billion contract from Verizon last year, describing the network equipment business \u2013 still small compared with that of rivals like Huawei \u2013 as a key business area.\n\nLee also needs to deal with paying inheritance tax to maintain control of the tech giant. Since Lee Kun-hee passed away, an estimated US$10.05 billion in inheritance tax is expected to be needed for his family to inherit his listed stockholdings alone.\n\nAnd he faces a separate trial over suspected accounting fraud and stock price manipulation connected to a 2015 merger that helped him assume greater control of Samsung Electronics.\n\nSuper-class company\n\nUrbane, reserved and media-shy, Lee has shown a relaxed side in public more recently after his release from detention.\n\nHe has been pictured eating lunch in staff cafeterias, taking selfies with employees, and smiling brightly when President Moon Jae-in visited a Samsung worksite in April 2019.\n\nIn May, he said he would not hand over management rights to his children and apologised for the behaviour of executives caught sabotaging labour union activities.\n\n\u201cA true super-class company is a sustainable company \u2026 I want to make a new Samsung,\u201d Lee said during his final statement to the court in December.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["business", "legal", "company", "lee", "manufacturing", "stepping", "samsung", "jaeyong", "shadow", "samsungs", "contract", "electronics", "cusp", "including", "chip", "fathers"], "summary": "SEOUL: For years, legal troubles have cast a cloud over Samsung Electronics Vice-Chairman Lee Jae-yong as he stood on the cusp of stepping out of his father\u2019s shadow and making a name for himself as the leader of the global tech giant.\nLee, 52, has been the de facto head of Samsung Electronics since his father, Lee Kun-hee, was hospitalised after a heart attack in 2014.\nFlagship businessesOne of Lee\u2019s focuses is Samsung\u2019s non-memory chip business, including chip contract manufacturing, calling on the staff to \u201ccreate another legend\u201d.\nAnd he faces a separate trial over suspected accounting fraud and stock price manipulation connected to a 2015 merger that helped him assume greater control of Samsung Electronics.\n\u201cA true super-class company is a sustainable company \u2026 I want to make a new Samsung,\u201d Lee said during his final statement to the court in December.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-01-17 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Insurance companies seeking ways to ease patients\u2019 expenses", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wMS8xNy9pbnN1cmFuY2UtY29tcGFuaWVzLXNlZWtpbmctd2F5cy10by1lYXNlLXBhdGllbnRzLWV4cGVuc2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/admission-registration-counter-sunway-medical-fb.jpg", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: Insurance and takaful companies said today they are working with the health ministry and Bank Negara Malaysia to explore ways to ease some of the expenses of Covid-19 patients who are treated in private hospitals.\n\nIn a joint statement, the Life Insurance Association of Malaysia, General Insurance Association of Malaysia and Malaysian Takaful Association said pandemic-related risks are generally not covered under any insurance and takaful plans worldwide.\n\n\u201cThe exclusion stems from the difficulty in pricing for coverage relating to an event like a pandemic that may occur once in a lifetime, having an incalculable impact and cost.

has been streamlined even further to specific services, after more than a week of the movement control order (MCO) this year.\n\nThe latest update of the MCO regulations gazetted on January 21 and published on the Federal Government Gazette\u2019s website lists 52 items under essential services, instead of 50 items in the January 15 gazette.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s what has changed in the latest list of essential services that can operate during MCO 2.0:\n\nInternet, postal, courier, broadcasting, call centre now specified\n\nIn the January 15 list (old), telecommunications and information technology were grouped together as item 28, but this category of services has been made more detailed in the latest January 21 list (new) by splitting them into item 28 and item 29 and adding new specific services such as call centres and internet services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOld: 28. Telecommunication and digital infrastructures including information and communication technology services and global business services\n\nNew: 28. Communications including telecommunications and internet, postal and courier, and broadcasting\n\n29. Information technology including global business services and call centre\n\nSlight change for e-commerce detail\n\nThe new list includes a slight tweak to the old list in the e-commerce item.\n\nOld: 29. E-commerce including e-marketplace, digital payment and local e-commerce internet centre services\n\nNew: 30: E-commerce including e-marketplace, digital payment and local e-commerce services centre\n\nNew category added on\n\nThis item was not mentioned in the old list.\n\nNew: 31. Digital creative content development in studio including film editing\n\nBoth the old and new lists contain a catch-all phrase of \u201cAny service, work, industry of business as determined by the Minister of Health after consulting the authority that regulates the services, work, industry and business\u201d, which essentially means that any businesses not included in the gazetted list of essential services may still be allowed to operate if the health minister decides that they can operate.\n\nThe new gazetted list takes effect on January 22, and applies to the whole of Malaysia except Sarawak \u2014 Johor, Kedah, Kelantan, Melaka, Negri Sembilan, Pahang, Penang, Perak, Perlis, Sabah, Selangor, Terengganu, Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya, Labuan \u2014 until February 2 which is when MCO is due to end. The new list also applies to Sibu in Sarawak where the MCO is scheduled to end January 29.\n\nThis is not the first time that the government has made changes to the list of essential services allowed to operate during MCO 2.0.\n\nThe Ministry of International Trade and Industry had on January 12 afternoon released a list of essential services for MCO 2.0 that included automotive manufacturing and after-sales services, but updated the list the same evening by removing that exemption and only listing automotive repair and maintenance as an essential service.\n\nThe government in MCO regulations gazetted on January 12 listed the manufacturing and production of \u201cautomotive equipment\u201d as an essential service but did not include automotive repair and maintenance.\n\nThe January 15 gazetted list of essential services updated this to be the manufacturing and production of \u201cautomotive (vehicles and components)\u201d instead of the \u201cautomotive equipment\u201d previously listed, while also adding \u201cautomotive (maintenance and repair)\u201d as a separate business under the services category that is allowed to continue to operate.\n\nThe changes in the list of essential services had resulted in carmakers Hondo, Toyota and Perodua briefly stopping activities in their factories in Malaysia, before resuming operations again.\n\nWhere to get the latest information\n\nIf you are a business owner and want to know about the latest rules, guidelines, standard operating procedures or frequently-asked questions issued by Miti, there is a dedicated section on the ministry\u2019s website with such MCO-related information (https://www.miti.gov.my/redir/pkp/pkp.html).\n\nHowever when Malay Mail visited the Miti website section dedicated to MCO information at around noon on Thursday, various editions \u2014 both old and new \u2014 of the list of essential services were found on the website.\n\nThis dedicated section has six sections: Media release, FAQs, SOPs and gazette, infographic, CIMS 3.0 tutorial video, and email enquiry.\n\nThe FAQ document in the FAQ section which was issued on January 12 by Miti in Bahasa Malaysia, comes with a list of essential services written in Bahasa Malaysia dated January 12.\n\nIn the media release section, a media release in English and issued on January 12 comes with a list of essential services written in English which was updated as of January 16 and sourced from the January 15 gazetted list.\n\nThe infographics section of the site carries two sets of slides or infographics \u2014 one in Bahasa Malaysia and another in English \u2014 on the list of essential services, with this based also on the January 15 gazetted list.\n\nAlso included in the infographics section is a set of slides dated January 20 of the list of 16 businesses allowed by the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) to operate during the MCO, with this list written in Bahasa Malaysia: Shopping complexes or malls, supermarkets and hypermarkets, departmental stores, pharmacies or selling of personal care products, convenience stores or mini marts, laundry shops (not including self-service laundromats), restaurants, furniture stores, jewellery shops, electrics and electronics stores, bookshops and stationery shops, hardware stores, pet food, vehicle workshops or maintenance or spare parts, vehicle sales and distribution centres, speciality retail stores at petrol stations.\n\n(On January 12, senior minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob when announcing the government\u2019s rules for areas under MCO had said that laundry shops except for self-service laundromats will be allowed to operate from 6am to 8pm. Following public complaints, Ismail Sabri however on January 14 said self-service laundromats will also be allowed to operate during MCO, with the condition that a worker is present to ensure physical distancing and check customers\u2019 body temperature. Although optometrists were not included in KPDNHEP\u2019s initial list, the government on January 15 confirmed that they were now allowed by the KPDNHEP to open during MCO based on tighter SOPs.)\n\nIn the SOPs and gazette section on Miti\u2019s MCO site, clicking on the federal gazette would lead to the latest January 21 government gazette containing the latest list of essential services, while the SOPs posted is also the latest National Security Council\u2019s general SOPs for MCO areas which is dated January 21.\n\nAs of noon yesterday, Miti\u2019s Facebook and Twitter accounts have yet to post information regarding the updated details in the gazetted list of essential services allowed to operate.\n\nAs for Sarawak (except for Sibu) which is under the conditional movement control order (CMCO) until January 31, the latest CMCO regulations gazetted by the federal government on January 21 maintains the list of prohibited activities that had been in use in previous editions of CMCO rules.\n\nThe list of prohibited activities under CMCO are: Outbound tour activities by Malaysians and inbound tour activities involving foreign tourists except foreign tourists from countries specified by the health minister, activities in pubs and nightclubs except for restaurant business in pubs and nightclubs, and any activity with many people attending at a place which makes it difficult to carry out physical distancing and to comply with the health director-general\u2019s directions. \u2015 Malay Mail\n\nRelated reading", "keyword": ["operate",

during the first MCO last year.\n\nThis time, he said, the MCO\u2019s purpose was to stabilise the nation\u2019s number of infections which had been on the rise since October 2020.\n\nWe do not want

It is still being reviewed,\u201d he said.\n\nBased on social media postings and a quick survey done by The Malaysian Reserve (TMR), many are of the opinion that the shorter operating hours of eateries during the MCO has increased the burden of the rakyat.\n\nRestoran Mahsuri owner Afnan Aiman said the move to allow businesses, eateries and shops to only operate from 6am to 8pm has caused more hardship to the rakyat, instead of helping them.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s not okay. Businesses have been a little slow because now we can\u2019t dine in and time is too limited because people would usually finish work at 6pm or much later, and by the time they reach home, there\u2019s not enough time to buy food because we\u2019re already closed.\n\n\u201cWhen this happens, it affects our businesses and sales have been shrinking,\u201d he told TMR.\n\nHe said if operating hours can be extended until 10pm, all restaurant operators will feel a little relieved and satisfied because most of them have more sales at night.\n\n\u201cAny restaurant, they depend more on customers who come at night. If the government is willing to extend the time, 10pm is already okay for us.\u201d\n\nAfnan also opined that the country\u2019s political instability has put a great weight on businesses, making people\u2019s lives more difficult than it already is.\n\n\u201cWe know Covid-19 is dangerous, why would the politicians want to take advantage at a time like this by holding elections and asking people to choose leaders?\n\n\u201cTo me, all of that is unnecessary.

Here, crop losses have been unavoidable as many sections of the fields have been under 2ft to 3ft of water for two to three weeks,\u201d said Carl Bek-Nielsen, chief executive (CEO) of United Plantations Bhd.\n\n\u201cThis adversely affects the ability to enter the fields and harvest the crop, let alone bring out the crop as fields are under water.\u201d\n\nIn Sarawak, Malaysia\u2019s second-biggest palm growing state, the drop in yields may be more severe than the 15% to 20% initially estimated over the next two months, according to Andrew Cheng, CEO of the Sarawak Oil Palm Plantation Owners Association.\n\nThat is because the acute worker shortage compounds production problems caused by floodwaters which have inundated plantations and interrupted harvesting, he said.\n\n\u201cI believe many oil palm plantations in Sarawak\u2019s lower-lying areas will be affected, especially with the King Tide coming in,\u201d Cheng said, referring to an especially high tide, which may lead to prolonged flooding.\n\n\u201cDue to the Covid-19 pandemic and the movement control order, we are unable to assess the overall situation.\u201d Sarawak makes up about 21% of the country\u2019s total palm oil output.\n\nBreaking point\n\nMalaysia\u2019s shortage of palm oil workers has become \u201cmuch, much worse\u201d compared with six months ago, and was likely responsible for up to 90% of the 3.6 million tonnes of fresh fruit bunches lost last year, Bek-Nielsen said.\n\n\u201cWe are at a breaking point that will result in considerable crop losses in 2021,\u201d he said. While first quarter production will not be much lower than last quarter, the impact from the acute labour shortage \u201cwill really start to bite and impact production from April to October\u201d, leading to a drop in output this year to 18.6 million tonnes. Output was 19.14 million tonnes in 2020.\n\nTo relieve the shortage of foreign workers, planters are seeking government approval for a safe way to bring guest workers into Malaysia, where all Covid-19 testing and quarantine costs are borne by employers, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, FGV Holdings Bhd, one of the country\u2019s biggest producers, said about 3,600ha in Pahang, Johor, Perak, Negeri Sembilan and Sabah were affected by flash floods, although there is no serious impact to field operations and mills are running as usual despite a drop in daily volumes.\n\nStill, there will be a \u201cslight impact on yield production due to weather affecting labour productivity in January and in the first quarter\u201d, it said in emailed responses. \u201cWe estimate the potential reduction in yields to be about 20% for January as compared with the earlier month, and by almost 20% in 1Q from the earlier period.\u201d\n\nIn Indonesia, the world\u2019s top producer, plantations have not been affected by the recent flooding in South Kalimantan, according to the Indonesian Palm Oil Association, or Gapki.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["oil", "labour", "crop", "whammy", "double", "floods", "output",

Azrul Mohd Khalib\n\nThere is an alarming emerging trend of resident associations and condominium managements requiring the disclosure of confidential medical information related to the Covid-19 status of people living in their neighbourhood.\n\nThere are demands for PCR or antigen test results, copies of passports and pictures of those who are positive. Most are aimed at foreigners. Residents are encouraged to inform on their neighbours. All being done supposedly in the name of collective protection, safety, and security.\n\nThis is a challenging and uncertain time for everyone.\n\nWith daily new Covid-19 numbers reaching record numbers, no peak in sight to the third wave, and more people in our communities, workplaces and families becoming infected, it is natural that we become increasingly fearful and insecure, not just for ourselves but also our loved ones.\n\nThe threat of death and disease, coupled with the general lack of knowledge of how Covid-19 spreads, and the need to blame someone for the pain and suffering that we see among those infected and affected, have led to a cloud of stigma.\n\nStigma now surrounds Covid-19, the people and communities who have contracted the disease. It is causing prejudice, discrimination, and xenophobia, widening inequalities, increasing vulnerabilities to violence, harassment and ostracisation, and hampering public health measures intended to manage the epidemic.\n\nThere are increasing reports of people and families who have recovered from infection or been released from home isolation or quarantine, being marginalised, or ostracised by their neighbours, family members, communities, and even loved ones, resulting in additional anxiety, and falling into depression.\n\nPeople have been blamed for supposedly bringing Covid-19 into housing areas and condominium complexes. Fingers were pointed at migrant workers when they were disproportionately represented in the daily statistics, which led to crackdowns by authorities, and caused fear and anxiety among even documented foreigners.\n\nFormer patients have lost jobs after their recovery. Families have been told to leave their rented homes. Tragically, out of a sense of overwhelming shame and fear of being a burden to their loved ones, some patients have recently taken their own lives. The list of consequences due to Covid-19-related stigma goes on.\n\nAll around the world, for those who have worked on AIDS for the past four decades, this sounds altogether too familiar. The same challenges, problems and harm of stigma and discrimination seen in that epidemic are manifesting themselves in the Covid-19 pandemic. But amid the ongoing tragedy, there is an opportunity.\n\nWe can apply what we have learnt from 40 years of the HIV-AIDS epidemic to what is happening today, in order to address the Covid-19 stigma. We do not need to repeat the same mistakes. We should not lose more lives through abuse, harm and suffering caused by Covid-19 prejudice and discrimination.\n\nIn our fear and frustration, we must resist adopting draconian measures that degrade or compromise on human rights and dignity.\n\nPast successful responses to public health emergencies have demonstrated repeatedly the value of grounding them in human rights.\n\nWe have learnt the hard way from the HIV-AIDS epidemic, that approaches which depend on punitive measures, shaming and discrimination undermine public health objectives and eventually fail in the long run. They end up doing more harm than good.\n\nSolidarity, empathy, and compassion reduce suffering, protect public health and save lives.\n\nNew Zealand has shown that when empathy and compassion are coupled with competence and firmness, the Covid-19 outbreak can be managed effectively and decisively.\n\nHumanise Covid-19 pandemic\n\nTo address Covid-19 stigma, we can do better in four areas.\n\nFirstly, we must humanise the Covid-19 pandemic. Today, the people and lives who have been touched by this disease are almost entirely represented by the health ministry\u2019s daily reported numbers of those infected, recovered, needing intensive care, placed on ventilator support, and who have died.\n\nThe human face of Malaysia\u2019s response to the outbreak is largely missing from these statistics.\n\nAside from what is shared online in social media, there are barely any stories in the mainstream media of people and their lived experiences of being infected and surviving, of the lives that have been lost. This has contributed to the fear, misinformation and stigma surrounding Covid-19.\n\nThe right to confidentiality and privacy of medical information should be protected. However, there are many who are willing and have volunteered to share their experiences, as patients, caregivers, emergency services and healthcare workers.\n\nGiving an opportunity for stories to be broadcast, especially those that are positive and uplifting, will go a long way in dealing with the ignorance and misunderstanding surrounding the disease and towards building a Covid-19 response that is free from stigma and discrimination.\n\nHealthcare workers, who have been at the forefront of the response to this public health emergency for a year now, have resorted to either posting on social media or covertly sharing their pain, suffering and frustrations with trusted media outlets.\n\nMany hope that by doing so, they would inform the public about what is happening in our hospitals and healthcare facilities, the day-to-day realities, and possibly gain public support and empathy.\n\nThe fact that they are forced to do so, often in a discreet manner largely to protect themselves from official repercussions, is a disservice to the sacrifices that they and their families have made. They should not have to do this. We need to highlight their stories in the media, listen to their appeals and respond to their requests for assistance.\n\nSecondly, we need to correct negative language that can fuel fear and stigma. We must avoid the use of stereotypical, negative expressions that can create or increase stigma, and focus on inclusive language.\n\nCommunities at risk or vulnerable to Covid-19 infection have been described as time bombs, fuelling fear and suspicion. Contracting Covid-19 does not mean someone has less value than anyone else.\n\nThe migrant worker community, for example, despite their obvious vulnerability and lack of adequate efforts to protect them, has been unfairly blamed for the outbreak, especially in the third wave.\n\nThirdly, a lesson learnt from people living with HIV is that: \u201cIf you take away our jobs, you will kill us faster than the virus.\u201d\n\nIn our response to dealing with Covid-19, we need to also protect jobs and people\u2019s livelihoods. Covid-19 and the resulting lockdowns have caused tremendous and unprecedented economic turmoil and impacted thousands of households.\n\nDue to lockdowns and closure of economic activities, it has deprived people of livelihoods and caused many families to slip closer towards or deeper into poverty. It is essential that those affected by Covid-19 face no stigma in returning to their jobs. Workers should not fear that they might lose their jobs if they test positive for Covid-19.\n\nPunitive laws do not work\n\nFinally, a key lesson from the HIV response is that exclusion and punitive laws do not work.\n\nEvery day, from the start of the first movement control order, we have heard how many people have been fined or arrested for SOP violations. Rather than contribute towards reductions in the number of people being infected with Covid-19, what it has achieved instead, is create an atmosphere of fear and resentment towards authorities especially with the appearance of double standards.\n\nMany, particularly those from lower income backgrounds have become victims of subjective enforcement.\n\nWith the number of new Covid-19 cases reaching record numbers, this emphasis on a punitive approach to disease prevention and control should be reviewed.\n\nThis is a public health emergency, not a war. There are no winners or losers, good sides or bad sides.\n\nIn this public health crisis, we need to look to our common humanity. Anyone can get infected during this global pandemic. Covid-19 does not discriminate, and neither should our response.\n\nWe should treat the individuals and communities affected by Covid-19 the same way how we would wish ourselves to be treated, with empathy and compassion. Government, community leaders and public health officials can lead by example and help prevent stigma and discrimination.\n\nNo one is safe until we are all safe, and stopping stigma is critical to making our communities safer and healthier. We need to work together to prevent and address stigma.\n\nAzrul Mohd Khalib is the head of Galen Centre for Health & Social Policy and is an FMT reader.\n\nThe views expressed are those of the writer

The next few years will decide whether Samsung will become, say, a global platform company or remain a hardware company,\u201d he said.\n\nLee, 52, has been the de facto head of Samsung Electronics since his father, Lee Kun-hee, was hospitalised after a heart attack in 2014.\n\nThe elder Lee died in October, but the chairmanship he held has yet to be filled, and uncertainty cast by his son\u2019s legal troubles was the chief reason, analysts said.\n\nVice-chairman since 2012, Lee has yet to make a mark \u2013 as his father did \u2013 by building the semiconductor business, which now brings in half of Samsung Electronics profits.\n\nAmid the moves meant to ensure his succession, Lee has fought against allegations of legal wrongdoing, including a year in prison in 2017-2018 over a bribery case involving impeached President Park Geun-hye.\n\nFlagship businesses\n\nOne of Lee\u2019s focuses is Samsung\u2019s non-memory chip business, including chip contract manufacturing, calling on the staff to \u201ccreate another legend\u201d.\n\nSamsung plans to invest US$121.47 billion in non-memory chips through 2030 to become No 1, including in chip contract manufacturing, where its 17% market share is a distant second to current No 1 TSMC\u2019s 54%, according to TrendForce.\n\nSamsung has also touted Lee\u2019s deal-making skills in winning a US$6.6 billion contract from Verizon last year, describing the network equipment business \u2013 still small compared with that of rivals like Huawei \u2013 as a key business area.\n\nLee also needs to deal with paying inheritance tax to maintain control of the tech giant. Since Lee Kun-hee passed away, an estimated US$10.05 billion in inheritance tax is expected to be needed for his family to inherit his listed stockholdings alone.\n\nAnd he faces a separate trial over suspected accounting fraud and stock price manipulation connected to a 2015 merger that helped him assume greater control of Samsung Electronics.\n\nSuper-class company\n\nUrbane, reserved and media-shy, Lee has shown a relaxed side in public more recently after his release from detention.\n\nHe has been pictured eating lunch in staff cafeterias, taking selfies with employees, and smiling brightly when President Moon Jae-in visited a Samsung worksite in April 2019.\n\nIn May, he said he would not hand over management rights to his children and apologised for the behaviour of executives caught sabotaging labour union activities.\n\n\u201cA true super-class company is a sustainable company \u2026 I want to make a new Samsung,\u201d Lee said during his final statement to the court in December.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["business", "legal", "company", "lee", "manufacturing", "stepping", "samsung", "jaeyong", "shadow", "samsungs", "contract", "electronics", "cusp", "including", "chip", "fathers"], "summary": "SEOUL: For years, legal troubles have cast a cloud over Samsung Electronics Vice-Chairman Lee Jae-yong as he stood on the cusp of stepping out of his father\u2019s shadow and making a name for himself as the leader of the global tech giant.\nLee, 52, has been the de facto head of Samsung Electronics since his father, Lee Kun-hee, was hospitalised after a heart attack in 2014.\nFlagship businessesOne of Lee\u2019s focuses is Samsung\u2019s non-memory chip business, including chip contract manufacturing, calling on the staff to \u201ccreate another legend\u201d.\nAnd he faces a separate trial over suspected accounting fraud and stock price manipulation connected to a 2015 merger that helped him assume greater control of Samsung Electronics.\n\u201cA true super-class company is a sustainable company \u2026 I want to make a new Samsung,\u201d Lee said during his final statement to the court in December.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-01-17 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Insurance companies seeking ways to ease patients\u2019 expenses", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wMS8xNy9pbnN1cmFuY2UtY29tcGFuaWVzLXNlZWtpbmctd2F5cy10by1lYXNlLXBhdGllbnRzLWV4cGVuc2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/admission-registration-counter-sunway-medical-fb.jpg", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: Insurance and takaful companies said today they are working with the health ministry and Bank Negara Malaysia to explore ways to ease some of the expenses of Covid-19 patients who are treated in private hospitals.\n\nIn a joint statement, the Life Insurance Association of Malaysia, General Insurance Association of Malaysia and Malaysian Takaful Association said pandemic-related risks are generally not covered under any insurance and takaful plans worldwide.\n\n\u201cThe exclusion stems from the difficulty in pricing for coverage relating to an event like a pandemic that may occur once in a lifetime, having an incalculable impact and cost.

20 \u2014 Vegetable prices in Melaka have increased by 20 to 70 per cent this week due to low supplies said Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) Melaka branch director Norena Jaafar.\n\nShe said most of the vegetables supplied to supermarkets and traders in the state are from Pasar Selayang in Kuala Lumpur but their stocks were not replenished since the vegetable section of the wholesale market was ordered to close from Monday to Friday this week, after Covid-19 cases were detected in the market.\n\n\u201cMelaka KPDNHEP is trying to get supplies from Cameron Highlands, Pahang but the flood situation there has not improved and this has hampered our efforts,\u201d she said when contacted by Bernama here today.\n\nNorena said apart from Cameron Highlands the agency would also try to get supplies of organic vegetables from farmers in Melaka, but they would cost more adding that consumers avoid buying organic vegetables as they were expensive.\n\nMeanwhile she said with more people staying home due to the movement control order (MCO) more people are spending time to cook and this has affected the supply of cooking oil, especially the one-kilogram packets.\n\n\u201cAs such we will limit sale of the 1kg cooking oil packets to three packets per customer, while waiting for the flood situation in Pahang to improve, as supplies of cooking oil in the state are mostly from Pahang,\u201d she said.\n\nIn addition, she said KPDNHEP would find the best way to solve the vegetable and cooking oil shortage in the state ahead of the Chinese New Year celebration next month.\n\nLast Monday, a news portal reported over 90 Covid-19 positive cases were detected in the Selayang Wholesale Market which led to its closure for four days from last Monday,

has been streamlined even further to specific services, after more than a week of the movement control order (MCO) this year.\n\nThe latest update of the MCO regulations gazetted on January 21 and published on the Federal Government Gazette\u2019s website lists 52 items under essential services, instead of 50 items in the January 15 gazette.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s what has changed in the latest list of essential services that can operate during MCO 2.0:\n\nInternet, postal, courier, broadcasting, call centre now specified\n\nIn the January 15 list (old), telecommunications and information technology were grouped together as item 28, but this category of services has been made more detailed in the latest January 21 list (new) by splitting them into item 28 and item 29 and adding new specific services such as call centres and internet services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOld: 28. Telecommunication and digital infrastructures including information and communication technology services and global business services\n\nNew: 28. Communications including telecommunications and internet, postal and courier, and broadcasting\n\n29. Information technology including global business services and call centre\n\nSlight change for e-commerce detail\n\nThe new list includes a slight tweak to the old list in the e-commerce item.\n\nOld: 29. E-commerce including e-marketplace, digital payment and local e-commerce internet centre services\n\nNew: 30: E-commerce including e-marketplace, digital payment and local e-commerce services centre\n\nNew category added on\n\nThis item was not mentioned in the old list.\n\nNew: 31. Digital creative content development in studio including film editing\n\nBoth the old and new lists contain a catch-all phrase of \u201cAny service, work, industry of business as determined by the Minister of Health after consulting the authority that regulates the services, work, industry and business\u201d, which essentially means that any businesses not included in the gazetted list of essential services may still be allowed to operate if the health minister decides that they can operate.\n\nThe new gazetted list takes effect on January 22, and applies to the whole of Malaysia except Sarawak \u2014 Johor, Kedah, Kelantan, Melaka, Negri Sembilan, Pahang, Penang, Perak, Perlis, Sabah, Selangor, Terengganu, Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya, Labuan \u2014 until February 2 which is when MCO is due to end. The new list also applies to Sibu in Sarawak where the MCO is scheduled to end January 29.\n\nThis is not the first time that the government has made changes to the list of essential services allowed to operate during MCO 2.0.\n\nThe Ministry of International Trade and Industry had on January 12 afternoon released a list of essential services for MCO 2.0 that included automotive manufacturing and after-sales services, but updated the list the same evening by removing that exemption and only listing automotive repair and maintenance as an essential service.\n\nThe government in MCO regulations gazetted on January 12 listed the manufacturing and production of \u201cautomotive equipment\u201d as an essential service but did not include automotive repair and maintenance.\n\nThe January 15 gazetted list of essential services updated this to be the manufacturing and production of \u201cautomotive (vehicles and components)\u201d instead of the \u201cautomotive equipment\u201d previously listed, while also adding \u201cautomotive (maintenance and repair)\u201d as a separate business under the services category that is allowed to continue to operate.\n\nThe changes in the list of essential services had resulted in carmakers Hondo, Toyota and Perodua briefly stopping activities in their factories in Malaysia, before resuming operations again.\n\nWhere to get the latest information\n\nIf you are a business owner and want to know about the latest rules, guidelines, standard operating procedures or frequently-asked questions issued by Miti, there is a dedicated section on the ministry\u2019s website with such MCO-related information (https://www.miti.gov.my/redir/pkp/pkp.html).\n\nHowever when Malay Mail visited the Miti website section dedicated to MCO information at around noon on Thursday, various editions \u2014 both old and new \u2014 of the list of essential services were found on the website.\n\nThis dedicated section has six sections: Media release, FAQs, SOPs and gazette, infographic, CIMS 3.0 tutorial video, and email enquiry.\n\nThe FAQ document in the FAQ section which was issued on January 12 by Miti in Bahasa Malaysia, comes with a list of essential services written in Bahasa Malaysia dated January 12.\n\nIn the media release section, a media release in English and issued on January 12 comes with a list of essential services written in English which was updated as of January 16 and sourced from the January 15 gazetted list.\n\nThe infographics section of the site carries two sets of slides or infographics \u2014 one in Bahasa Malaysia and another in English \u2014 on the list of essential services, with this based also on the January 15 gazetted list.\n\nAlso included in the infographics section is a set of slides dated January 20 of the list of 16 businesses allowed by the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) to operate during the MCO, with this list written in Bahasa Malaysia: Shopping complexes or malls, supermarkets and hypermarkets, departmental stores, pharmacies or selling of personal care products, convenience stores or mini marts, laundry shops (not including self-service laundromats), restaurants, furniture stores, jewellery shops, electrics and electronics stores, bookshops and stationery shops, hardware stores, pet food, vehicle workshops or maintenance or spare parts, vehicle sales and distribution centres, speciality retail stores at petrol stations.\n\n(On January 12, senior minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob when announcing the government\u2019s rules for areas under MCO had said that laundry shops except for self-service laundromats will be allowed to operate from 6am to 8pm. Following public complaints, Ismail Sabri however on January 14 said self-service laundromats will also be allowed to operate during MCO, with the condition that a worker is present to ensure physical distancing and check customers\u2019 body temperature. Although optometrists were not included in KPDNHEP\u2019s initial list, the government on January 15 confirmed that they were now allowed by the KPDNHEP to open during MCO based on tighter SOPs.)\n\nIn the SOPs and gazette section on Miti\u2019s MCO site, clicking on the federal gazette would lead to the latest January 21 government gazette containing the latest list of essential services, while the SOPs posted is also the latest National Security Council\u2019s general SOPs for MCO areas which is dated January 21.\n\nAs of noon yesterday, Miti\u2019s Facebook and Twitter accounts have yet to post information regarding the updated details in the gazetted list of essential services allowed to operate.\n\nAs for Sarawak (except for Sibu) which is under the conditional movement control order (CMCO) until January 31, the latest CMCO regulations gazetted by the federal government on January 21 maintains the list of prohibited activities that had been in use in previous editions of CMCO rules.\n\nThe list of prohibited activities under CMCO are: Outbound tour activities by Malaysians and inbound tour activities involving foreign tourists except foreign tourists from countries specified by the health minister, activities in pubs and nightclubs except for restaurant business in pubs and nightclubs, and any activity with many people attending at a place which makes it difficult to carry out physical distancing and to comply with the health director-general\u2019s directions. \u2015 Malay Mail\n\nRelated reading", "keyword": ["operate",

It is still being reviewed,\u201d he said.\n\nBased on social media postings and a quick survey done by The Malaysian Reserve (TMR), many are of the opinion that the shorter operating hours of eateries during the MCO has increased the burden of the rakyat.\n\nRestoran Mahsuri owner Afnan Aiman said the move to allow businesses, eateries and shops to only operate from 6am to 8pm has caused more hardship to the rakyat, instead of helping them.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s not okay. Businesses have been a little slow because now we can\u2019t dine in and time is too limited because people would usually finish work at 6pm or much later, and by the time they reach home, there\u2019s not enough time to buy food because we\u2019re already closed.\n\n\u201cWhen this happens, it affects our businesses and sales have been shrinking,\u201d he told TMR.\n\nHe said if operating hours can be extended until 10pm, all restaurant operators will feel a little relieved and satisfied because most of them have more sales at night.\n\n\u201cAny restaurant, they depend more on customers who come at night. If the government is willing to extend the time, 10pm is already okay for us.\u201d\n\nAfnan also opined that the country\u2019s political instability has put a great weight on businesses, making people\u2019s lives more difficult than it already is.\n\n\u201cWe know Covid-19 is dangerous, why would the politicians want to take advantage at a time like this by holding elections and asking people to choose leaders?\n\n\u201cTo me, all of that is unnecessary. They should solve this problem first before their politics. If they can\u2019t help us, don\u2019t help us.\u201d\n\nKedai Kopi Payung owner Nor Baizura Jamil told TMR the operating hours were pleasant at first as it gives time for her to close shop early and rest.\n\n\u201cBut from an economic standpoint, sales have been down to half of what we made before. We have experienced a lot of our customers trying to come and buy food around 6pm or before we close.\u201d\n\nShe also believes that it is better to extend the operating hours so that businesses can run accordingly to reach its sales targets and customers will not feel distressed.\n\nThe situation has caused quite the stir on Twitter when the hashtag #SiBodohKauDengarSini, which translates to \u201cListen here, idiot\u201d, became a trending topic recently.\n\nIt all started when user @farhanazahan complained about not having dinner two nights in a row and that he faced problems while ordering food even though he placed an early order at 5pm.\n\nHe also tweeted that compared to Ismail Sabri, he does not have a maid to serve food at home when he gets back from work.\n\nAnother user @puterirajaawan replied that she \u201cdoes not understand people who create problems out of everything\u201d.\n\nShe suggested ordering the food early to store it in the fridge and reheat it the next day.\n\nThis elicited a response from @yarafaee_ whose tweet started with \u201cSi bodoh, kau dengar sini\u201d before elaborating that food delivery platforms are facing technical problems to fulfil substantial orders during a short window.\n\n\u201cPeople who got back from work do not have time to cook because they have to get up early the next day to go back to work.\u201d\n\nShe also tweeted \u201cinstead of telling the rakyat to find a way, why not ask the government to extend operating hours?\u201d", "keyword": ["govt", "problems", "hours", "early", "closing", "8pm", "instead", "short", "extend", "operating", "reconsiders", "sales", "food", "businesses"], "summary": "Based on social media postings and a quick survey done by The Malaysian Reserve (TMR), many are of the opinion that the shorter operating hours of eateries during the MCO has increased the burden of the rakyat.\nRestoran Mahsuri owner Afnan Aiman said the move to allow businesses, eateries and shops to only operate from 6am to 8pm has caused more hardship to the rakyat, instead of helping them.\n\u201cWhen this happens, it affects our businesses and sales have been shrinking,\u201d he told TMR.\nHe said if operating hours can be extended until 10pm, all restaurant operators will feel a little relieved and satisfied because most of them have more sales at night.\nShe suggested ordering the food early to store it in the fridge and reheat it the next day.", "news": "The Malaysian Reserve", "date": "2021-01-20 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Kapayan rep urges state government to expedite aid efforts to flood victims in Penampang", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVib3JuZW9wb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzAxLzE3L2thcGF5YW4tcmVwLXVyZ2VzLXN0YXRlLWdvdmVybm1lbnQtdG8tZXhwZWRpdGUtYWlkLWVmZm9ydHMtdG8tZmxvb2QtdmljdGltcy1pbi1wZW5hbXBhbmcv0gEA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2021/01/WhatsApp-Image-2021-01-17-at-13.02.58.jpeg", "text": "KOTA KINABALU (Jan 17): Kapayan assemblywoman Jannie Lasimbang urges the Gabungan Rakyat Sabah (GRS) state government to expedite efforts to send assistance to those affected by the flood in Penampang and other districts.\n\nJannie also urged the government to continue to source for funds for the flood mitigation project in Penampang.\n\nJannie in a statement today said she was saddened to see Donggongon township and surrounding villages like Kampung Hungab, Kampung Tunoh, Bundusan as well as a few housing estates there flooded again.\n\n\u201cDuring my time in government, I have tried to find a solution to the flooding problem.

Here, crop losses have been unavoidable as many sections of the fields have been under 2ft to 3ft of water for two to three weeks,\u201d said Carl Bek-Nielsen, chief executive (CEO) of United Plantations Bhd.\n\n\u201cThis adversely affects the ability to enter the fields and harvest the crop, let alone bring out the crop as fields are under water.\u201d\n\nIn Sarawak, Malaysia\u2019s second-biggest palm growing state, the drop in yields may be more severe than the 15% to 20% initially estimated over the next two months, according to Andrew Cheng, CEO of the Sarawak Oil Palm Plantation Owners Association.\n\nThat is because the acute worker shortage compounds production problems caused by floodwaters which have inundated plantations and interrupted harvesting, he said.\n\n\u201cI believe many oil palm plantations in Sarawak\u2019s lower-lying areas will be affected, especially with the King Tide coming in,\u201d Cheng said, referring to an especially high tide, which may lead to prolonged flooding.\n\n\u201cDue to the Covid-19 pandemic and the movement control order, we are unable to assess the overall situation.\u201d Sarawak makes up about 21% of the country\u2019s total palm oil output.\n\nBreaking point\n\nMalaysia\u2019s shortage of palm oil workers has become \u201cmuch, much worse\u201d compared with six months ago, and was likely responsible for up to 90% of the 3.6 million tonnes of fresh fruit bunches lost last year, Bek-Nielsen said.\n\n\u201cWe are at a breaking point that will result in considerable crop losses in 2021,\u201d he said. While first quarter production will not be much lower than last quarter, the impact from the acute labour shortage \u201cwill really start to bite and impact production from April to October\u201d, leading to a drop in output this year to 18.6 million tonnes. Output was 19.14 million tonnes in 2020.\n\nTo relieve the shortage of foreign workers, planters are seeking government approval for a safe way to bring guest workers into Malaysia, where all Covid-19 testing and quarantine costs are borne by employers, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, FGV Holdings Bhd, one of the country\u2019s biggest producers, said about 3,600ha in Pahang, Johor, Perak, Negeri Sembilan and Sabah were affected by flash floods, although there is no serious impact to field operations and mills are running as usual despite a drop in daily volumes.\n\nStill, there will be a \u201cslight impact on yield production due to weather affecting labour productivity in January and in the first quarter\u201d, it said in emailed responses. \u201cWe estimate the potential reduction in yields to be about 20% for January as compared with the earlier month, and by almost 20% in 1Q from the earlier period.\u201d\n\nIn Indonesia, the world\u2019s top producer, plantations have not been affected by the recent flooding in South Kalimantan, according to the Indonesian Palm Oil Association, or Gapki.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["oil", "labour", "crop", "whammy", "double", "floods", "output",

EU-Malaysia Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Eurocham Malaysia) via Malay Mail\n\nAll Malaysian states (except Sarawak) are currently under Movement Control Order (MCO) until 4th February.\n\nMOH predicts 5,000 daily new infections the week after Chinese New Year\n\nHealth Director-General Tan Sri Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah released data showing the infection rate of Covid-19 or (R0/ Rt) as of 22nd January at 1.09.\n\nBut if the R0 increases to 1.2, MOH forecasts 5,000 daily new cases in the third week of February, followed by 8,000 daily new cases in the third week of March.\n\nThe third week of February coincides with the end of Chinese New Year, but the occasion is unlikely to affect the case numbers as interstate travel and social gatherings are currently banned.\n\nKadar kebolehjangkitan Covid-19 atau Ro/Rt pada jangkaan mengikut kes seharian pada 22 Januari 2021 untuk seluruh negara adalah 1.09.

Government buses leave daily from Shimla to Kalpa, so that can be your budget option.\n\nIf you want comfort, then you can hire a chauffeur-driven car instead. Another alternative is to rent a car from Chandigarh and drive yourself.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nKalpa has a few hotels and many homestay options, such as the Fort-View Homestay and The Village View Homestay.\n\nBoth were very nice and cosy experiences with wonderful views, so do choose whichever suits you.\n\nWhere to eat\n\nThere are no good restaurants, although you can try dining in at Echor. There are two or three restaurants here that are, frankly, quite expensive yet not up to the mark.\n\nThat being said, your best bet will be to eat at your homestay or hotel restaurant.\n\nThings to do\n\nYou can explore all the nooks and corners of this small town within two whole days as Kalpa is a small village with few things to do.\n\nHowever, don\u2019t let that stop you from enjoying the atmosphere and the mood.\n\nHere are some places you can visit:\n\nChandalika Temple\n\nChandalika Devi temple is done in beautiful Himachali architecture and offers a gorgeous view of Kinnau Kailash at sunrise.\n\nKalpa Monastery\n\nOne must visit this peaceful Buddhist monastery at Kalpa. The chants in the evenings and mornings add to the ambiance of this town.\n\nSuicide Point\n\nSuicide Point is 5km away from the town, so if you\u2019re looking for that perfect cliffside Instagram picture, this is the place for it.\n\nVillage tour\n\nKalpa is a self-sustaining village with a lot of organic farming activity going on. You can take a stroll to the farm or visit the old heritage houses in and around the village.\n\nApple Orchard tour\n\nKalpa has many apple orchards and if you are visiting during the harvest season, which is around August or October, be sure to visit them.\n\nAmit and Anindita are Indian Travel bloggers who blog at Travel Like We Do.

Azrul Mohd Khalib\n\nThere is an alarming emerging trend of resident associations and condominium managements requiring the disclosure of confidential medical information related to the Covid-19 status of people living in their neighbourhood.\n\nThere are demands for PCR or antigen test results, copies of passports and pictures of those who are positive. Most are aimed at foreigners. Residents are encouraged to inform on their neighbours. All being done supposedly in the name of collective protection, safety, and security.\n\nThis is a challenging and uncertain time for everyone.\n\nWith daily new Covid-19 numbers reaching record numbers, no peak in sight to the third wave, and more people in our communities, workplaces and families becoming infected, it is natural that we become increasingly fearful and insecure, not just for ourselves but also our loved ones.\n\nThe threat of death and disease, coupled with the general lack of knowledge of how Covid-19 spreads, and the need to blame someone for the pain and suffering that we see among those infected and affected, have led to a cloud of stigma.\n\nStigma now surrounds Covid-19, the people and communities who have contracted the disease. It is causing prejudice, discrimination, and xenophobia, widening inequalities, increasing vulnerabilities to violence, harassment and ostracisation, and hampering public health measures intended to manage the epidemic.\n\nThere are increasing reports of people and families who have recovered from infection or been released from home isolation or quarantine, being marginalised, or ostracised by their neighbours, family members, communities, and even loved ones, resulting in additional anxiety, and falling into depression.\n\nPeople have been blamed for supposedly bringing Covid-19 into housing areas and condominium complexes. Fingers were pointed at migrant workers when they were disproportionately represented in the daily statistics, which led to crackdowns by authorities, and caused fear and anxiety among even documented foreigners.\n\nFormer patients have lost jobs after their recovery. Families have been told to leave their rented homes. Tragically, out of a sense of overwhelming shame and fear of being a burden to their loved ones, some patients have recently taken their own lives. The list of consequences due to Covid-19-related stigma goes on.\n\nAll around the world, for those who have worked on AIDS for the past four decades, this sounds altogether too familiar. The same challenges, problems and harm of stigma and discrimination seen in that epidemic are manifesting themselves in the Covid-19 pandemic. But amid the ongoing tragedy, there is an opportunity.\n\nWe can apply what we have learnt from 40 years of the HIV-AIDS epidemic to what is happening today, in order to address the Covid-19 stigma. We do not need to repeat the same mistakes. We should not lose more lives through abuse, harm and suffering caused by Covid-19 prejudice and discrimination.\n\nIn our fear and frustration, we must resist adopting draconian measures that degrade or compromise on human rights and dignity.\n\nPast successful responses to public health emergencies have demonstrated repeatedly the value of grounding them in human rights.\n\nWe have learnt the hard way from the HIV-AIDS epidemic, that approaches which depend on punitive measures, shaming and discrimination undermine public health objectives and eventually fail in the long run. They end up doing more harm than good.\n\nSolidarity, empathy, and compassion reduce suffering, protect public health and save lives.\n\nNew Zealand has shown that when empathy and compassion are coupled with competence and firmness, the Covid-19 outbreak can be managed effectively and decisively.\n\nHumanise Covid-19 pandemic\n\nTo address Covid-19 stigma, we can do better in four areas.\n\nFirstly, we must humanise the Covid-19 pandemic. Today, the people and lives who have been touched by this disease are almost entirely represented by the health ministry\u2019s daily reported numbers of those infected, recovered, needing intensive care, placed on ventilator support, and who have died.\n\nThe human face of Malaysia\u2019s response to the outbreak is largely missing from these statistics.\n\nAside from what is shared online in social media, there are barely any stories in the mainstream media of people and their lived experiences of being infected and surviving, of the lives that have been lost. This has contributed to the fear, misinformation and stigma surrounding Covid-19.\n\nThe right to confidentiality and privacy of medical information should be protected. However, there are many who are willing and have volunteered to share their experiences, as patients, caregivers, emergency services and healthcare workers.\n\nGiving an opportunity for stories to be broadcast, especially those that are positive and uplifting, will go a long way in dealing with the ignorance and misunderstanding surrounding the disease and towards building a Covid-19 response that is free from stigma and discrimination.\n\nHealthcare workers, who have been at the forefront of the response to this public health emergency for a year now, have resorted to either posting on social media or covertly sharing their pain, suffering and frustrations with trusted media outlets.\n\nMany hope that by doing so, they would inform the public about what is happening in our hospitals and healthcare facilities, the day-to-day realities, and possibly gain public support and empathy.\n\nThe fact that they are forced to do so, often in a discreet manner largely to protect themselves from official repercussions, is a disservice to the sacrifices that they and their families have made. They should not have to do this. We need to highlight their stories in the media, listen to their appeals and respond to their requests for assistance.\n\nSecondly, we need to correct negative language that can fuel fear and stigma. We must avoid the use of stereotypical, negative expressions that can create or increase stigma, and focus on inclusive language.\n\nCommunities at risk or vulnerable to Covid-19 infection have been described as time bombs, fuelling fear and suspicion. Contracting Covid-19 does not mean someone has less value than anyone else.\n\nThe migrant worker community, for example, despite their obvious vulnerability and lack of adequate efforts to protect them, has been unfairly blamed for the outbreak, especially in the third wave.\n\nThirdly, a lesson learnt from people living with HIV is that: \u201cIf you take away our jobs, you will kill us faster than the virus.\u201d\n\nIn our response to dealing with Covid-19, we need to also protect jobs and people\u2019s livelihoods. Covid-19 and the resulting lockdowns have caused tremendous and unprecedented economic turmoil and impacted thousands of households.\n\nDue to lockdowns and closure of economic activities, it has deprived people of livelihoods and caused many families to slip closer towards or deeper into poverty. It is essential that those affected by Covid-19 face no stigma in returning to their jobs. Workers should not fear that they might lose their jobs if they test positive for Covid-19.\n\nPunitive laws do not work\n\nFinally, a key lesson from the HIV response is that exclusion and punitive laws do not work.\n\nEvery day, from the start of the first movement control order, we have heard how many people have been fined or arrested for SOP violations. Rather than contribute towards reductions in the number of people being infected with Covid-19, what it has achieved instead, is create an atmosphere of fear and resentment towards authorities especially with the appearance of double standards.\n\nMany, particularly those from lower income backgrounds have become victims of subjective enforcement.\n\nWith the number of new Covid-19 cases reaching record numbers, this emphasis on a punitive approach to disease prevention and control should be reviewed.\n\nThis is a public health emergency, not a war. There are no winners or losers, good sides or bad sides.\n\nIn this public health crisis, we need to look to our common humanity. Anyone can get infected during this global pandemic. Covid-19 does not discriminate, and neither should our response.\n\nWe should treat the individuals and communities affected by Covid-19 the same way how we would wish ourselves to be treated, with empathy and compassion. Government, community leaders and public health officials can lead by example and help prevent stigma and discrimination.\n\nNo one is safe until we are all safe, and stopping stigma is critical to making our communities safer and healthier. We need to work together to prevent and address stigma.\n\nAzrul Mohd Khalib is the head of Galen Centre for Health & Social Policy and is an FMT reader.\n\nThe views expressed are those of the writer

published on the Federal Government Gazette\u2019s website lists 52 items under essential services, instead of 50 items in the January 15 gazette.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s what has changed in the latest list of essential services that can operate during MCO 2.0:\n\nInternet, postal, courier, broadcasting, call centre now specified\n\nIn the January 15 list (old), telecommunications and information technology were grouped together as item 28, but this category of services has been made more detailed in the latest January 21 list (new) by splitting them into item 28 and item 29 and adding new specific services such as call centres and internet services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOld: 28. Telecommunication and digital infrastructures including information and communication technology services and global business services\n\nNew: 28. Communications including telecommunications and internet, postal and courier, and broadcasting\n\n29. Information technology including global business services and call centre\n\nSlight change for e-commerce detail\n\nThe new list includes a slight tweak to the old list in the e-commerce item.\n\nOld: 29. E-commerce including e-marketplace, digital payment and local e-commerce internet centre services\n\nNew: 30: E-commerce including e-marketplace, digital payment and local e-commerce services centre\n\nNew category added on\n\nThis item was not mentioned in the old list.\n\nNew: 31. Digital creative content development in studio including film editing\n\nBoth the old and new lists contain a catch-all phrase of \u201cAny service, work, industry of business as determined by the Minister of Health after consulting the authority that regulates the services, work, industry and business\u201d, which essentially means that any businesses not included in the gazetted list of essential services may still be allowed to operate if the health minister decides that they can operate.\n\nThe new gazetted list takes effect on January 22, and applies to the whole of Malaysia except Sarawak \u2014 Johor, Kedah, Kelantan, Melaka, Negri Sembilan, Pahang, Penang, Perak, Perlis, Sabah, Selangor, Terengganu, Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya, Labuan \u2014 until February 2 which is when MCO is due to end. The new list also applies to Sibu in Sarawak where the MCO is scheduled to end January 29.\n\nThis is not the first time that the government has made changes to the list of essential services allowed to operate during MCO 2.0.\n\nThe Ministry of International Trade and Industry had on January 12 afternoon released a list of essential services for MCO 2.0 that included automotive manufacturing and after-sales services, but updated the list the same evening by removing that exemption and only listing automotive repair and maintenance as an essential service.\n\nThe government in MCO regulations gazetted on January 12 listed the manufacturing and production of \u201cautomotive equipment\u201d as an essential service but did not include automotive repair and maintenance.\n\nThe January 15 gazetted list of essential services updated this to be the manufacturing and production of \u201cautomotive (vehicles and components)\u201d instead of the \u201cautomotive equipment\u201d previously listed, while also adding \u201cautomotive (maintenance and repair)\u201d as a separate business under the services category that is allowed to continue to operate.\n\nThe changes in the list of essential services had resulted in carmakers Hondo, Toyota and Perodua briefly stopping activities in their factories in Malaysia, before resuming operations again.\n\nWhere to get the latest information\n\nIf you are a business owner and want to know about the latest rules, guidelines, standard operating procedures or frequently-asked questions issued by Miti, there is a dedicated section on the ministry\u2019s website with such MCO-related information (https://www.miti.gov.my/redir/pkp/pkp.html).\n\nHowever when Malay Mail visited the Miti website section dedicated to MCO information at around noon on Thursday, various editions \u2014 both old and new \u2014 of the list of essential services were found on the website.\n\nThis dedicated section has six sections: Media release, FAQs, SOPs and gazette, infographic, CIMS 3.0 tutorial video, and email enquiry.\n\nThe FAQ document in the FAQ section which was issued on January 12 by Miti in Bahasa Malaysia, comes with a list of essential services written in Bahasa Malaysia dated January 12.\n\nIn the media release section, a media release in English and issued on January 12 comes with a list of essential services written in English which was updated as of January 16 and sourced from the January 15 gazetted list.\n\nThe infographics section of the site carries two sets of slides or infographics \u2014 one in Bahasa Malaysia and another in English \u2014 on the list of essential services, with this based also on the January 15 gazetted list.\n\nAlso included in the infographics section is a set of slides dated January 20 of the list of 16 businesses allowed by the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) to operate during the MCO, with this list written in Bahasa Malaysia: Shopping complexes or malls, supermarkets and hypermarkets, departmental stores, pharmacies or selling of personal care products, convenience stores or mini marts, laundry shops (not including self-service laundromats), restaurants, furniture stores, jewellery shops, electrics and electronics stores, bookshops and stationery shops, hardware stores, pet food, vehicle workshops or maintenance or spare parts, vehicle sales and distribution centres, speciality retail stores at petrol stations.\n\n(On January 12, senior minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob when announcing the government\u2019s rules for areas under MCO had said that laundry shops except for self-service laundromats will be allowed to operate from 6am to 8pm. Following public complaints, Ismail Sabri however on January 14 said self-service laundromats will also be allowed to operate during MCO, with the condition that a worker is present to ensure physical distancing and check customers\u2019 body temperature. Although optometrists were not included in KPDNHEP\u2019s initial list, the government on January 15 confirmed that they were now allowed by the KPDNHEP to open during MCO based on tighter SOPs.)\n\nIn the SOPs and gazette section on Miti\u2019s MCO site, clicking on the federal gazette would lead to the latest January 21 government gazette containing the latest list of essential services, while the SOPs posted is also the latest National Security Council\u2019s general SOPs for MCO areas which is dated January 21.\n\nAs of noon yesterday, Miti\u2019s Facebook and Twitter accounts have yet to post information regarding the updated details in the gazetted list of essential services allowed to operate.\n\nAs for Sarawak (except for Sibu) which is under the conditional movement control order (CMCO) until January 31, the latest CMCO regulations gazetted by the federal government on January 21 maintains the list of prohibited activities that had been in use in previous editions of CMCO rules.\n\nThe list of prohibited activities under CMCO are: Outbound tour activities by Malaysians and inbound tour activities involving foreign tourists except foreign tourists from countries specified by the health minister, activities in pubs and nightclubs except for restaurant business in pubs and nightclubs, and any activity with many people attending at a place which makes it difficult to carry out physical distancing and to comply with the health director-general\u2019s directions. \u2015 Malay Mail\n\nRelated reading", "keyword": ["operate",

We didn\u2019t really know where we were. We just wanted to run away,\u201d Diana tells FMT, recounting the horrific day.\n\nDiana and Dorothy had spent nearly all their lives in a children\u2019s home in Buntong, but after being caught recording the bullying and emotional abuse kids at the home faced, they had been sent away.\n\nThe girls said the home\u2019s caretaker sent them away at night to \u201clive with their father\u201d, a person they\u2019ve never even met, in a shack in a rural village in Batu Gajah.\n\nAt the house, they said, bottles of cheap liquor were strewn on the floor, and Diana says the man they were told was their father was drunk and slurring. Another foreign couple lived in the house too.\n\nFortunately, nothing untoward happened that night. The next day, the two girls told their \u201cfather\u201d they were going to a nearby sundry shop and ran off to tell passers-by of their plight. They were put in touch with an NGO that helped people in distress.\n\nThe NGO called Persatuan Harapan India Malaysia came to the girls\u2019 rescue after being told of their ordeal, and the plight others faced at the children\u2019s home.\n\nM Manimaran, the group\u2019s president, said he was shocked to hear what was happening in the children\u2019s home, and since then, has managed to rescue six children and placed them in another home.\n\nFMT is withholding the name of the home pending a comment from its management.\n\nManimaran has also lodged a police report and filed a complaint with the Welfare Department.\n\nDiana says children at the home are often bullied and scolded by the caretakers.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of kind people who donate things to the home, but these items get taken away. We are also threatened against speaking about what happens at the home.\u201d\n\nThey claimed the children are also being given Christian names and are forced to attend activities at a church.\n\nA pair of sisters rescued from the home, Salvander Kaur Vikram Singh, 17 and Elvina Kaur, 14, also spoke of their traumatic experiences at the home.\n\nThe girls from Johor were sent to the children\u2019s home as their parents could not afford to provide them a good education.\n\n\u201cMy sister and I were threatened that if we did not obey (what the caretakers demanded), they would cut our hair short.\u201d Sikh men and women do not cut their hair, as part of their practice.\n\n\u201cThey forced us to go to church and pray. If we refused, they would threaten to call our parents. There are times our parents did call but they could not speak to us because they were told we were busy studying or not around, when in fact we were there.\u201d\n\nElvina actually had her hair cut short as punishment for refusing to listen to a caretaker\u2019s demands.\n\n\u201cNow my sister and I are no longer there, we are happy.

It is still being reviewed,\u201d he said.\n\nBased on social media postings and a quick survey done by The Malaysian Reserve (TMR), many are of the opinion that the shorter operating hours of eateries during the MCO has increased the burden of the rakyat.\n\nRestoran Mahsuri owner Afnan Aiman said the move to allow businesses, eateries and shops to only operate from 6am to 8pm has caused more hardship to the rakyat, instead of helping them.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s not okay. Businesses have been a little slow because now we can\u2019t dine in and time is too limited because people would usually finish work at 6pm or much later, and by the time they reach home, there\u2019s not enough time to buy food because we\u2019re already closed.\n\n\u201cWhen this happens, it affects our businesses and sales have been shrinking,\u201d he told TMR.\n\nHe said if operating hours can be extended until 10pm, all restaurant operators will feel a little relieved and satisfied because most of them have more sales at night.\n\n\u201cAny restaurant, they depend more on customers who come at night. If the government is willing to extend the time, 10pm is already okay for us.\u201d\n\nAfnan also opined that the country\u2019s political instability has put a great weight on businesses, making people\u2019s lives more difficult than it already is.\n\n\u201cWe know Covid-19 is dangerous, why would the politicians want to take advantage at a time like this by holding elections and asking people to choose leaders?\n\n\u201cTo me, all of that is unnecessary. They should solve this problem first before their politics. If they can\u2019t help us, don\u2019t help us.\u201d\n\nKedai Kopi Payung owner Nor Baizura Jamil told TMR the operating hours were pleasant at first as it gives time for her to close shop early and rest.\n\n\u201cBut from an economic standpoint, sales have been down to half of what we made before. We have experienced a lot of our customers trying to come and buy food around 6pm or before we close.\u201d\n\nShe also believes that it is better to extend the operating hours so that businesses can run accordingly to reach its sales targets and customers will not feel distressed.\n\nThe situation has caused quite the stir on Twitter when the hashtag #SiBodohKauDengarSini, which translates to \u201cListen here, idiot\u201d, became a trending topic recently.\n\nIt all started when user @farhanazahan complained about not having dinner two nights in a row and that he faced problems while ordering food even though he placed an early order at 5pm.\n\nHe also tweeted that compared to Ismail Sabri, he does not have a maid to serve food at home when he gets back from work.\n\nAnother user @puterirajaawan replied that she \u201cdoes not understand people who create problems out of everything\u201d.\n\nShe suggested ordering the food early to store it in the fridge and reheat it the next day.\n\nThis elicited a response from @yarafaee_ whose tweet started with \u201cSi bodoh, kau dengar sini\u201d before elaborating that food delivery platforms are facing technical problems to fulfil substantial orders during a short window.\n\n\u201cPeople who got back from work do not have time to cook because they have to get up early the next day to go back to work.\u201d\n\nShe also tweeted \u201cinstead of telling the rakyat to find a way, why not ask the government to extend operating hours?\u201d", "keyword": ["govt", "problems", "hours", "early", "closing", "8pm", "instead", "short", "extend", "operating", "reconsiders", "sales", "food", "businesses"], "summary": "Based on social media postings and a quick survey done by The Malaysian Reserve (TMR), many are of the opinion that the shorter operating hours of eateries during the MCO has increased the burden of the rakyat.\nRestoran Mahsuri owner Afnan Aiman said the move to allow businesses, eateries and shops to only operate from 6am to 8pm has caused more hardship to the rakyat, instead of helping them.\n\u201cWhen this happens, it affects our businesses and sales have been shrinking,\u201d he told TMR.\nHe said if operating hours can be extended until 10pm, all restaurant operators will feel a little relieved and satisfied because most of them have more sales at night.\nShe suggested ordering the food early to store it in the fridge and reheat it the next day.", "news": "The Malaysian Reserve", "date": "2021-01-20 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Kapayan rep urges state government to expedite aid efforts to flood victims in Penampang", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVib3JuZW9wb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzAxLzE3L2thcGF5YW4tcmVwLXVyZ2VzLXN0YXRlLWdvdmVybm1lbnQtdG8tZXhwZWRpdGUtYWlkLWVmZm9ydHMtdG8tZmxvb2QtdmljdGltcy1pbi1wZW5hbXBhbmcv0gEA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2021/01/WhatsApp-Image-2021-01-17-at-13.02.58.jpeg", "text": "KOTA KINABALU (Jan 17): Kapayan assemblywoman Jannie Lasimbang urges the Gabungan Rakyat Sabah (GRS) state government to expedite efforts to send assistance to those affected by the flood in Penampang and other districts.\n\nJannie also urged the government to continue to source for funds for the flood mitigation project in Penampang.\n\nJannie in a statement today said she was saddened to see Donggongon township and surrounding villages like Kampung Hungab, Kampung Tunoh, Bundusan as well as a few housing estates there flooded again.\n\n\u201cDuring my time in government, I have tried to find a solution to the flooding problem.

Here, crop losses have been unavoidable as many sections of the fields have been under 2ft to 3ft of water for two to three weeks,\u201d said Carl Bek-Nielsen, chief executive (CEO) of United Plantations Bhd.\n\n\u201cThis adversely affects the ability to enter the fields and harvest the crop, let alone bring out the crop as fields are under water.\u201d\n\nIn Sarawak, Malaysia\u2019s second-biggest palm growing state, the drop in yields may be more severe than the 15% to 20% initially estimated over the next two months, according to Andrew Cheng, CEO of the Sarawak Oil Palm Plantation Owners Association.\n\nThat is because the acute worker shortage compounds production problems caused by floodwaters which have inundated plantations and interrupted harvesting, he said.\n\n\u201cI believe many oil palm plantations in Sarawak\u2019s lower-lying areas will be affected, especially with the King Tide coming in,\u201d Cheng said, referring to an especially high tide, which may lead to prolonged flooding.\n\n\u201cDue to the Covid-19 pandemic and the movement control order, we are unable to assess the overall situation.\u201d Sarawak makes up about 21% of the country\u2019s total palm oil output.\n\nBreaking point\n\nMalaysia\u2019s shortage of palm oil workers has become \u201cmuch, much worse\u201d compared with six months ago, and was likely responsible for up to 90% of the 3.6 million tonnes of fresh fruit bunches lost last year, Bek-Nielsen said.\n\n\u201cWe are at a breaking point that will result in considerable crop losses in 2021,\u201d he said. While first quarter production will not be much lower than last quarter, the impact from the acute labour shortage \u201cwill really start to bite and impact production from April to October\u201d, leading to a drop in output this year to 18.6 million tonnes. Output was 19.14 million tonnes in 2020.\n\nTo relieve the shortage of foreign workers, planters are seeking government approval for a safe way to bring guest workers into Malaysia, where all Covid-19 testing and quarantine costs are borne by employers, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, FGV Holdings Bhd, one of the country\u2019s biggest producers, said about 3,600ha in Pahang, Johor, Perak, Negeri Sembilan and Sabah were affected by flash floods, although there is no serious impact to field operations and mills are running as usual despite a drop in daily volumes.\n\nStill, there will be a \u201cslight impact on yield production due to weather affecting labour productivity in January and in the first quarter\u201d, it said in emailed responses. \u201cWe estimate the potential reduction in yields to be about 20% for January as compared with the earlier month, and by almost 20% in 1Q from the earlier period.\u201d\n\nIn Indonesia, the world\u2019s top producer, plantations have not been affected by the recent flooding in South Kalimantan, according to the Indonesian Palm Oil Association, or Gapki.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["oil", "labour", "crop", "whammy", "double", "floods", "output",

those responsible are held accountable.\n\n\u201cWe are of the opinion that, if Suhakam\u2019s findings are consistent with what the families are claiming, then they should be used as an additional

figures, and must involve a collective effort with a variety of groups.\n\nSuaram lamented the limits that have been placed on Suhakam\u2019s powers by the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia Act 1999, which it says has long \u201chobbled\u201d the institution.\n\nOne example that has been openly debated over the last week is Section 12(2), which stops the commission from inquiring into any complaint once it is before a judicial inquiry, which Suaram said had been the reason for a number of prior investigations being dropped.\n\n\u201cCivil societies have always addressed the inadequacies of the Act and pushed Suhakam to address human rights violations in a broader sense and push the boundaries within its restricted mandate and powers.\u201d\n\nRecently, the non-governmental organisation Eliminating Deaths and Abuse in Custody Together (EDICT) had told Suhakam to stop its inquiries into custodial deaths after it said G Jestus Kevin had died as a result of blunt force trauma.\n\nEDICT claimed that inquiries into custodial death did not come under Suhakam\u2019s purview.\n\nHowever, Suhakam commissioner Mah Weng Kwai insisted that they have the power to investigate any allegation that comes to their attention as long as the matter is not in court, with Suhakam\u2019s investigation into the Jestus case concluding in April, before the matter went to

radius allowed by the government.\n\nIn the incident shared on We Are Malaysian Facebook page, the original poster (OP) said she had ventured out from her home at around 10 am on Sunday (24 Jan) to buy groceries. On her way out, she was stopped by police at a roadblock.\n\n\u201cPolice officer told me \u201cTak logic. U Bagitau Waze itu tepat tak?\u201d\n\nOP explained to the police officers that she was going out to buy food and groceries nearby, adding that she had checked Waze and confirmed that the journey was within 10 km radius of her house.\n\nOP shared in the post that this was her first time being stopped for such an issue at a roadblock, adding that she was completely speechless and confused.\n\nIf Waze is not tepat (accurate) I\u2019ve no idea which is tepat other than Google.

The chants in the evenings and mornings add to the ambiance of this town.\n\nSuicide Point\n\nSuicide Point is 5km away from the town, so if you\u2019re looking for that perfect cliffside Instagram picture, this is the place for it.\n\nVillage tour\n\nKalpa is a self-sustaining village with a lot of organic farming activity going on. You can take a stroll to the farm or visit the old heritage houses in and around the village.\n\nApple Orchard tour\n\nKalpa has many apple orchards and if you are visiting during the harvest season, which is around August or October, be sure to visit them.\n\nAmit and Anindita are Indian Travel bloggers who blog at Travel Like We Do.

Azrul Mohd Khalib\n\nThere is an alarming emerging trend of resident associations and condominium managements requiring the disclosure of confidential medical information related to the Covid-19 status of people living in their neighbourhood.\n\nThere are demands for PCR or antigen test results, copies of passports and pictures of those who are positive. Most are aimed at foreigners. Residents are encouraged to inform on their neighbours. All being done supposedly in the name of collective protection, safety, and security.\n\nThis is a challenging and uncertain time for everyone.\n\nWith daily new Covid-19 numbers reaching record numbers, no peak in sight to the third wave, and more people in our communities, workplaces and families becoming infected, it is natural that we become increasingly fearful and insecure, not just for ourselves but also our loved ones.\n\nThe threat of death and disease, coupled with the general lack of knowledge of how Covid-19 spreads, and the need to blame someone for the pain and suffering that we see among those infected and affected, have led to a cloud of stigma.\n\nStigma now surrounds Covid-19, the people and communities who have contracted the disease. It is causing prejudice, discrimination, and xenophobia, widening inequalities, increasing vulnerabilities to violence, harassment and ostracisation, and hampering public health measures intended to manage the epidemic.\n\nThere are increasing reports of people and families who have recovered from infection or been released from home isolation or quarantine, being marginalised, or ostracised by their neighbours, family members, communities, and even loved ones, resulting in additional anxiety, and falling into depression.\n\nPeople have been blamed for supposedly bringing Covid-19 into housing areas and condominium complexes. Fingers were pointed at migrant workers when they were disproportionately represented in the daily statistics, which led to crackdowns by authorities, and caused fear and anxiety among even documented foreigners.\n\nFormer patients have lost jobs after their recovery. Families have been told to leave their rented homes. Tragically, out of a sense of overwhelming shame and fear of being a burden to their loved ones, some patients have recently taken their own lives. The list of consequences due to Covid-19-related stigma goes on.\n\nAll around the world, for those who have worked on AIDS for the past four decades, this sounds altogether too familiar. The same challenges, problems and harm of stigma and discrimination seen in that epidemic are manifesting themselves in the Covid-19 pandemic. But amid the ongoing tragedy, there is an opportunity.\n\nWe can apply what we have learnt from 40 years of the HIV-AIDS epidemic to what is happening today, in order to address the Covid-19 stigma. We do not need to repeat the same mistakes. We should not lose more lives through abuse, harm and suffering caused by Covid-19 prejudice and discrimination.\n\nIn our fear and frustration, we must resist adopting draconian measures that degrade or compromise on human rights and dignity.\n\nPast successful responses to public health emergencies have demonstrated repeatedly the value of grounding them in human rights.\n\nWe have learnt the hard way from the HIV-AIDS epidemic, that approaches which depend on punitive measures, shaming and discrimination undermine public health objectives and eventually fail in the long run. They end up doing more harm than good.\n\nSolidarity, empathy, and compassion reduce suffering, protect public health and save lives.\n\nNew Zealand has shown that when empathy and compassion are coupled with competence and firmness, the Covid-19 outbreak can be managed effectively and decisively.\n\nHumanise Covid-19 pandemic\n\nTo address Covid-19 stigma, we can do better in four areas.\n\nFirstly, we must humanise the Covid-19 pandemic. Today, the people and lives who have been touched by this disease are almost entirely represented by the health ministry\u2019s daily reported numbers of those infected, recovered, needing intensive care, placed on ventilator support, and who have died.\n\nThe human face of Malaysia\u2019s response to the outbreak is largely missing from these statistics.\n\nAside from what is shared online in social media, there are barely any stories in the mainstream media of people and their lived experiences of being infected and surviving, of the lives that have been lost. This has contributed to the fear, misinformation and stigma surrounding Covid-19.\n\nThe right to confidentiality and privacy of medical information should be protected. However, there are many who are willing and have volunteered to share their experiences, as patients, caregivers, emergency services and healthcare workers.\n\nGiving an opportunity for stories to be broadcast, especially those that are positive and uplifting, will go a long way in dealing with the ignorance and misunderstanding surrounding the disease and towards building a Covid-19 response that is free from stigma and discrimination.\n\nHealthcare workers, who have been at the forefront of the response to this public health emergency for a year now, have resorted to either posting on social media or covertly sharing their pain, suffering and frustrations with trusted media outlets.\n\nMany hope that by doing so, they would inform the public about what is happening in our hospitals and healthcare facilities, the day-to-day realities, and possibly gain public support and empathy.\n\nThe fact that they are forced to do so, often in a discreet manner largely to protect themselves from official repercussions, is a disservice to the sacrifices that they and their families have made. They should not have to do this. We need to highlight their stories in the media, listen to their appeals and respond to their requests for assistance.\n\nSecondly, we need to correct negative language that can fuel fear and stigma. We must avoid the use of stereotypical, negative expressions that can create or increase stigma, and focus on inclusive language.\n\nCommunities at risk or vulnerable to Covid-19 infection have been described as time bombs, fuelling fear and suspicion. Contracting Covid-19 does not mean someone has less value than anyone else.\n\nThe migrant worker community, for example, despite their obvious vulnerability and lack of adequate efforts to protect them, has been unfairly blamed for the outbreak, especially in the third wave.\n\nThirdly, a lesson learnt from people living with HIV is that: \u201cIf you take away our jobs, you will kill us faster than the virus.\u201d\n\nIn our response to dealing with Covid-19, we need to also protect jobs and people\u2019s livelihoods. Covid-19 and the resulting lockdowns have caused tremendous and unprecedented economic turmoil and impacted thousands of households.\n\nDue to lockdowns and closure of economic activities, it has deprived people of livelihoods and caused many families to slip closer towards or deeper into poverty. It is essential that those affected by Covid-19 face no stigma in returning to their jobs. Workers should not fear that they might lose their jobs if they test positive for Covid-19.\n\nPunitive laws do not work\n\nFinally, a key lesson from the HIV response is that exclusion and punitive laws do not work.\n\nEvery day, from the start of the first movement control order, we have heard how many people have been fined or arrested for SOP violations. Rather than contribute towards reductions in the number of people being infected with Covid-19, what it has achieved instead, is create an atmosphere of fear and resentment towards authorities especially with the appearance of double standards.\n\nMany, particularly those from lower income backgrounds have become victims of subjective enforcement.\n\nWith the number of new Covid-19 cases reaching record numbers, this emphasis on a punitive approach to disease prevention and control should be reviewed.\n\nThis is a public health emergency, not a war. There are no winners or losers, good sides or bad sides.\n\nIn this public health crisis, we need to look to our common humanity. Anyone can get infected during this global pandemic. Covid-19 does not discriminate, and neither should our response.\n\nWe should treat the individuals and communities affected by Covid-19 the same way how we would wish ourselves to be treated, with empathy and compassion. Government, community leaders and public health officials can lead by example and help prevent stigma and discrimination.\n\nNo one is safe until we are all safe, and stopping stigma is critical to making our communities safer and healthier. We need to work together to prevent and address stigma.\n\nAzrul Mohd Khalib is the head of Galen Centre for Health & Social Policy and is an FMT reader.\n\nThe views expressed are those of the writer

The next few years will decide whether Samsung will become, say, a global platform company or remain a hardware company,\u201d he said.\n\nLee, 52, has been the de facto head of Samsung Electronics since his father, Lee Kun-hee, was hospitalised after a heart attack in 2014.\n\nThe elder Lee died in October, but the chairmanship he held has yet to be filled, and uncertainty cast by his son\u2019s legal troubles was the chief reason, analysts said.\n\nVice-chairman since 2012, Lee has yet to make a mark \u2013 as his father did \u2013 by building the semiconductor business, which now brings in half of Samsung Electronics profits.\n\nAmid the moves meant to ensure his succession, Lee has fought against allegations of legal wrongdoing, including a year in prison in 2017-2018 over a bribery case involving impeached President Park Geun-hye.\n\nFlagship businesses\n\nOne of Lee\u2019s focuses is Samsung\u2019s non-memory chip business, including chip contract manufacturing, calling on the staff to \u201ccreate another legend\u201d.\n\nSamsung plans to invest US$121.47 billion in non-memory chips through 2030 to become No 1, including in chip contract manufacturing, where its 17% market share is a distant second to current No 1 TSMC\u2019s 54%, according to TrendForce.\n\nSamsung has also touted Lee\u2019s deal-making skills in winning a US$6.6 billion contract from Verizon last year, describing the network equipment business \u2013 still small compared with that of rivals like Huawei \u2013 as a key business area.\n\nLee also needs to deal with paying inheritance tax to maintain control of the tech giant. Since Lee Kun-hee passed away, an estimated US$10.05 billion in inheritance tax is expected to be needed for his family to inherit his listed stockholdings alone.\n\nAnd he faces a separate trial over suspected accounting fraud and stock price manipulation connected to a 2015 merger that helped him assume greater control of Samsung Electronics.\n\nSuper-class company\n\nUrbane, reserved and media-shy, Lee has shown a relaxed side in public more recently after his release from detention.\n\nHe has been pictured eating lunch in staff cafeterias, taking selfies with employees, and smiling brightly when President Moon Jae-in visited a Samsung worksite in April 2019.\n\nIn May, he said he would not hand over management rights to his children and apologised for the behaviour of executives caught sabotaging labour union activities.\n\n\u201cA true super-class company is a sustainable company \u2026 I want to make a new Samsung,\u201d Lee said during his final statement to the court in December.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["business", "legal", "company", "lee", "manufacturing", "stepping", "samsung", "jaeyong", "shadow", "samsungs", "contract", "electronics", "cusp", "including", "chip", "fathers"], "summary": "SEOUL: For years, legal troubles have cast a cloud over Samsung Electronics Vice-Chairman Lee Jae-yong as he stood on the cusp of stepping out of his father\u2019s shadow and making a name for himself as the leader of the global tech giant.\nLee, 52, has been the de facto head of Samsung Electronics since his father, Lee Kun-hee, was hospitalised after a heart attack in 2014.\nFlagship businessesOne of Lee\u2019s focuses is Samsung\u2019s non-memory chip business, including chip contract manufacturing, calling on the staff to \u201ccreate another legend\u201d.\nAnd he faces a separate trial over suspected accounting fraud and stock price manipulation connected to a 2015 merger that helped him assume greater control of Samsung Electronics.\n\u201cA true super-class company is a sustainable company \u2026 I want to make a new Samsung,\u201d Lee said during his final statement to the court in December.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-01-17 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Insurance companies seeking ways to ease patients\u2019 expenses", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wMS8xNy9pbnN1cmFuY2UtY29tcGFuaWVzLXNlZWtpbmctd2F5cy10by1lYXNlLXBhdGllbnRzLWV4cGVuc2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/admission-registration-counter-sunway-medical-fb.jpg", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: Insurance and takaful companies said today they are working with the health ministry and Bank Negara Malaysia to explore ways to ease some of the expenses of Covid-19 patients who are treated in private hospitals.\n\nIn a joint statement, the Life Insurance Association of Malaysia, General Insurance Association of Malaysia and Malaysian Takaful Association said pandemic-related risks are generally not covered under any insurance and takaful plans worldwide.\n\n\u201cThe exclusion stems from the difficulty in pricing for coverage relating to an event like a pandemic that may occur once in a lifetime, having an incalculable impact and cost.
