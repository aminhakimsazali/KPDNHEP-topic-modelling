Malaysia Used Vehicle Autoparts Traders Association (MUVATA) has called upon the government to clarify the position of new and used automotive parts importers, exporters, wholesalers and retailers it represents to be classified under the spare parts sector, the association wrote in an e-mailed statement.\n\nThe association pleads with the ministry of domestic trade and consumer affairs (KPDNHEP) to clarify that businesses dealing in auto parts are under the spare parts sector, which have been allowed to operate, along with car workshops and tyre shops, under FMCO conditions as of June 1.\n\nIt states that most of its members have received approval to operate from the Covid-19 intelligent management system (CIMS) 3.0 under the purview of the ministry of international trade and industry (MITI), having selected peruncitan, pengedaran dan pemborongan (retail, distribution or wholesaling), with the sub-sectors of bengkel, penyelenggaraan dan alat ganti (workshops, maintenance and spare parts).\n\nReports have, however, been received from a few of its members in Johor Bahru, said MUVATA, saying they have been told by the Johor Bahru City Council (MBJB) that they are to shut down immediately as they are deemed not to be categorised under the auto parts sector, and an MBJB officer said that the alat ganti term for permitted businesses is only applicable to those trading in new auto parts, the statement read.\n\nA similar situation was reportedly encountered by the association\u2019s members in Perak, where the police have deemed the businesses\u2019 selected category on the forms to be incorrect, and therefore have also been told to shut down. MUVATA says that used auto parts business operators are now very confused, and some have not dared to remain open for fear of receiving hefty fines, it said, adding that \u201cguidelines need to be clear and consistent, otherwise [it] will burden the industry.\u201d\n\nIn terms of operations, MUVATA hopes that the authorities understand that unlike businesses trading in new auto parts, traders of used parts need to carry out minor dismantling work in order to obtain said used parts, such as by taking apart a large group of components to acquire smaller, individual parts.\n\nThe association suggests that enforcement agencies have perhaps misunderstood used auto parts as being under the manufacturing sector, and therefore have not allowed essential auto parts businesses to operate, and clarifies that the parts selection processes are purely to the customers\u2019 requirements.\n\n\u201cWe wish to convey that it is crucial for new and used auto parts to go hand-in-hand with workshops, as it is useless for workshops to operate without auto parts, new or used,\u201d the statement from MUVATA read. It adds that the logistics sector, which serves transportation for medicine, food and beverage, is reliant on repairs and servicing, and that disruptions in parts supply may see workshops face major challenges.\n\nAccording to an internal survey held by MUVATA, 20% of its members have stated that they are unable to survive, and would be forced to close down if the lockdown is prolonged. While the auto parts sector is listed as an essential category, its members\u2019 business volume has dropped by nearly 70% in this full movement control order (FMCO), it said.\n\nThe association also asks for the government to allow used auto parts companies with the relevant approval letters to operate with a workforce of 60%, for businesses including wholesale, export and the dismantling and sorting of auto parts, and not just for selling to local workshops. In closing, the MUVATA statement reads that \u201cthe industry welcomes the automatic bank loan moratorium, as well as the extension and enhancement of the wage subsidy programme.\u201d\n\nUpon the FMCO taking effect on June 1, vehicle repair (body and paint) and service centres have been allowed to operate at 60% worker capacity, KPDNHEP minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi said at the time. MUVATA also calls for the acceleration of the mass immunisation programme, including for the auto parts sectors as its members\u2019 personnel are customer-facing and therefore are frontliners, as they have to be physically present to discharge their duties and tasks.\n\nMeanwhile in the area of new vehicles, sales are expected to approach zero for the month of June as showrooms nationwide are closed due to the FMCO, with significant financial impact, reported Berita Harian last week. Based on an average vehicle price of RM70,000, the country\u2019s automotive industry is set to lose around RM3.44 billion in revenue due to the sales slump.", "keyword": ["operate", "used",

If there is any honour left in them, they would have resigned.\n\nThere is no excuse and they cannot expect to be fined like other citizens because they represent the SOPs (standard operating procedures), the MCOs and supported the Emergency and everything that came with it.\n\nWhile most opinions tend to be more forgiving of Mustapa and the brunt reserved for Mohd Rashid, ultimately, the wrongs they committed were of equal proportion.\n\nNo doubt, there had been other leaders from the government who had breached the SOPs. By now, whether they got punished or fined just like other ordinary citizens is no longer the issue.\n\nThe offenders from the government should actually tender their resignations and not pass the burden of rectifying their wrongs to the police or other enforcement bodies.\n\nSuch expectations are actually too highly placed, in fact almost delusionary.\n\nHowever, if Prime Minister (PM) Tan Sri Mahiaddin Md Yassin and other senior leaders in the government are still clueless as to why public disaffection towards them is not just simmering but reaching boiling point, they should be told that they suffer from trust deficit from all aspects of governance and administration.\n\nThe issue of being a backdoor government, not having legitimacy and backstabbing their political friends have taken a backseat and overtaken by their inefficiency, flip-flops, ineptitude, double-standards, shady deals, incompetence, cluelessness and repeat all these many folds.\n\nBecause of their inability to rule and manage the nation, all their past sins are catching up with them.\n\nThen there is the tendency of putting their foot in their mouth \u2014 one example is the quote that he can\u2019t be expected to take care of all 32 million Malaysians.\n\nIt may sound honest, but anyone accepting the top post in the government, especially when no one had put the gun to his or her head, meant that the whole populace, whether they are supporters or doubters or opponents, all and sundry are the leader\u2019s responsibility.\n\nIt is then no surprise that today, as the \u201cwhite flag\u201d campaign gathers momentum, it signifies the loss of confidence in the government to resolve their ails and they would probably by now accept they are the ones that did not make it to the list of citizens that the leader could take care of.\n\nA PAS leader who tried to mock the campaign \u2014 aimed at getting those who are too ashamed to seek assistance to put up the flag to signify their desperation \u2014 was either in denial or being defensive as he is part of the \u201cfailed government\u201d.\n\nRoundly censured, PAS is yet another component of the ruling coalition that adds to the missteps of the government, which even without is already overflowing the brim.\n\nIf opinions and actions are insufficient to add to the woes or being publicly denounced, even a prepared statement from the PM\u2019s Office regarding Mahiaddin\u2019s health did not pass public scrutiny.\n\nIn the first place, it is incomprehensible why his office chose to share the one detail that led to the PM being hospitalised and placed under observation.\n\nBy any standards, no one discussed such conditions publicly as problems of the bowel movements at best would only be shared with doctors or in the days of yore, with the dukun or shaman master, or maybe not given their prowess of insights of knowing even without being told.\n\nInstead of sympathy or at least a short truce until the PM is discharged, the choice of word in the statement went trending and nuanced creatively to mock and undermine the government of the day. While it can be dismissed as petty, any discerning and sensitive leader would know that the government has totally lost both the plot and public confidence.\n\nAnd they can only salvage some redemption by exiting.", "keyword": ["sops", "goodwill", "leaders", "statement", "rashid", "issue", "left", "spare", "nary", "wrongs", "citizens", "leader", "public"], "summary": "While most opinions tend to be more forgiving of Mustapa and the brunt reserved for Mohd Rashid, ultimately, the wrongs they committed were of equal proportion.\nNo doubt, there had been other leaders from the government who had breached the SOPs.\nBy now, whether they got punished or fined just like other ordinary citizens is no longer the issue.\nBecause of their inability to rule and manage the nation, all their past sins are catching up with them.\nWhile it can be dismissed as petty, any discerning and sensitive leader would know that the government has totally lost both the plot and public confidence.", "news": "The Malaysian Reserve", "date": "2021-07-02 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Absorb all contract doctors into govt service, says DAP", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wNi8yNy9hYnNvcmItYWxsLWNvbnRyYWN0LWRvY3RvcnMtaW50by1nb3Z0LXNlcnZpY2Utc2F5cy1kYXAv0gEA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Fmt Reporters"], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hospital-staff-doctor-nurse-bernama-101020.jpg", "text": "PETALING JAYA: The government must devise a long-term financial plan to absorb all the 23,000 contract doctors into the government service as soon as possible because they will be needed to fight the Covid-19 pandemic on a long-term basis, says DAP.\n\nParty secretary-general Lim Guan Eng said the government should not even think of race and religion when offering the position to these junior doctors, as requested by an NGO which urged the health ministry to ensure all Bumiputera medical officers were absorbed into the health service.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, DAP supports the Malaysian Medical Association\u2019s concerns about a government proposal placing new medical graduates on a permanent basis, which appears to discriminate against non-Bumiputeras.\n\n\u201cTo win the battle against Covid-19, a whole-of society effort is required that needs to mobilise all trained health workers, regardless of race, religion or socio-economic background,\u201d he said in a statement today.\n\nYesterday, the MMA criticised a proposal for Putrajaya to ensure that new medical officers, especially from among the Bumiputeras, would be placed in permanent posts.\n\nMMA president Dr Subramaniam Muniandy said racial or religious prejudices should not influence the selection of officers or whether they should serve in permanent positions.\n\nHe said Malaysia needed the best and brightest individuals to serve the people, adding that talent should not distinguish between ethnicity, religion, creed or gender.\n\nLim, the Bagan MP, said since the Perikatan Nasional government had admitted that Covid-19 is endemic and would not go away even after herd immunity is achieved, the country needed more doctors, nurses and trained health workers.\n\n\u201cAn extra RM4 billion will enable all to be employed.

Also, some developers are offering buyers to rent with an option to purchase,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve (TMR).\n\nCCO & Associates (KL) Sdn Bhd ED Chan Wai Seen said the rental for residential properties has undergone adjustments since 2015 and many landlords have been charging low rentals in order to attract tenants.\n\n\u201cGenerally, rental rates for newly completed projects or properties located nearby new projects will continue to be highly competitive. Rental rates may gradually improve when properties located within the new projects have achieved high occupancy rates.\n\n\u201cWith the large number of affordable properties coming into the market, we expect rental will remain at a highly competitive level,\u201d he told TMR.\n\nAreca Capital Sdn Bhd CEO Danny Wong Teck Meng said there are two schools of thought.\n\nFirstly, that the supply glut of residential properties is still hanging thus affecting the rental market; and on the other hand, many working adults now prefer to rent rather than buy properties.\n\nWong is of the opinion that it highly depends on the location, adding that the rental market is still soft for the time being.\n\nAsiacap Valuers & Property Consultants Sdn Bhd property valuer Kit Au Yong surmised the property market to remain in a soft condition in 2H21 going into 1H22, with possibly slow gradual improvement in 2H22.\n\n\u201cWe maintain a cautious view about the property market performance.

A day earlier, Muhyiddin had said that Parliament could meet by September or October at the earliest and only if daily Covid-19 cases dropped below 2,000.\n\nCheng said not all Umno ministers may withdraw from the government in the midst of the pandemic.\n\nUmno would have a better chance of governing the country after a general election as it is expected to gain ground support from rural and urban Malays, he said.\n\n\u201cUntil then, Umno will have to strategise its moves,\u201d he added.\n\nCheng added that it is unclear if Muhyiddin still holds a majority in the Dewan Rakyat, especially after two Umno MPs said they have withdrawn their support. The two are Kelantan Umno chief and Machang MP Ahmad Jazlan Yaakub, and Padang Rengas MP Nazri Aziz, while Gua Musang MP Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah said he refused to back Muhyiddin as prime minister.\n\nCheng said a few MPs may jump ship to support Muhyiddin\u2019s administration.

A funeral mass began at 10am local time, at the Ateneo de Manila University, Aquino\u2019s alma mater, where his funeral urn had been on view on Friday.\n\nAquino\u2019s passing comes as the political landscape shifts in a country dominated by dynasties.\n\nIn recent years, President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s clan based in the south of the Philippines has been dominant. With Duterte patronage, the family of former president and dictator Ferdinand Marcos \u2013 the nemesis of the Aquinos \u2013 has seen its fortunes revive.\n\nAquino\u2019s sudden death prompted much reflection on his six-year term, which ended in 2016 and saw the economic revival of the so called \u201csick man of Asia\u201d.\n\nPresident Duterte declared 10 days of national mourning and called Aquino\u2019s death \u201can opportunity to unite in prayer and set aside our differences\u201d.\n\nAquino, the country\u2019s 15th president, was inaugurated in June 2010 following a landslide election win delivered on the back of a strong anti-graft campaign.\n\nThe former senator had not been his party\u2019s first choice, but calls for him to run mounted after the death in August 2009 of his mother, Corazon Aquino, a former president. For supporters, an Aquino was the answer to the massive corruption plaguing the country.\n\n\u201cI accept the plea of the nation. I also accept the instructions of my parents. I accept the responsibility to continue the fight for our country,\u201d Aquino said when he declared his candidacy.\n\nThat was just 40 days after his mother\u2019s death, and he was speaking in the same venue where she took her oath of office in 1986. Many regarded it as a moment of history repeating itself.\n\nAquino\u2019s father, Sen Benigno \u201cNinoy\u201d Aquino Jr, was assassinated in 1983 on the tarmac of Manila International Airport \u2013 subsequently renamed in his honour \u2013 as he returned from exile in the US.\n\nThe opposition leader\u2019s callous murder was the catalyst for People Power, the revolutionary movement that brought down the Marcos dictatorship and catapulted Corazon Aquino, a housewife, into the presidency.\n\nAlthough he arrived in office on the coattails of his parents, Aquino went on to create a significant legacy in this own right.\n\nHis sound economic management and image of incorruptibility inspired confidence from investors long spooked by crooked politics, coup attempts and corruption scandals.\n\nOn Aquino\u2019s watch, gross domestic product mushroomed to an average of 6% annually, the largest in 40 years. Annual foreign direct investment rose to US$8.3 billion in 2016 from just US$2 billion before he entered office. The country\u2019s credit ratings all went up.\n\nThe last president also strengthened the old defence alliance with the US In 2013, he challenged China\u2019s expansion claims in the disputed South China Sea.\n\nThe country\u2019s most powerful neighbour lost international arbitration at The Hague in a ruling handed down a week after Aquino left office. China never recognised the court\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cPresident Aquino\u2019s steadfast commitment to advancing peace, upholding the rule of law, and driving economic growth for all Filipinos, while taking bold steps to promote the rules-based international order, leaves a remarkable legacy at home and abroad that will endure for the years to come,\u201d US President Joe Biden said in a statement.\n\nBut for all his international prestige, reducing domestic poverty and social inequality remained stubborn challenges for Aquino. That created an opening for Duterte \u2013 an outsider who advocated strongarm tactics against national problems.\n\nA week before the 2016 elections, Aquino warned voters off Duterte, implying that he had the makings of a dictator.\n\nStill the mayor of Davao City in the southern province of Mindanao broke the Manila hold on politics and won by a landslide with over six million votes more than closest rival Mar Roxas, Aquino\u2019s anointed successor.\n\nDuterte\u2019s presidency has been markedly different on all scores. He embraced China and distanced himself from the US.\n\nHe launched a brutal drugs war that has killed thousands of alleged offenders \u2013 a bloody campaign that while popular at home was heavily condemned abroad. Duterte also cracked down on business elites associated with Aquino to rally support.\n\nSome regarded Aquino as elitist, and Duterte\u2019s ordinary man image appealed to many Filipinos. The president\u2019s popularity has not waned, and his brash politics have eclipsed the Aquino brand.\n\nIn the 2019 mid-term elections, Duterte-allied candidates, including his former aide Bong Go and police chief Ronald Dela Rosa, won most of the 12 seats on the table. Aquino\u2019s cousin, Paolo Benigno \u201cBam\u201d Aquino IV, meanwhile failed to get re-elected.\n\nAlthough Duterte enjoys overwhelming support, Aquino\u2019s death could have some impact on the political scene, analysts believe.\n\nIt has come less than a year ahead of the May 2022 presidential elections. The early frontrunner is Sara Duterte, the president\u2019s daughter and mayor of Davao.\n\nFerdinand Marcos Jr, \u2013 a former senator and the son of the late president, has also emerged as a strong contender in opinion polls. Marcos lost by a slim margin to Aquino-backed Leni Robredo in the 2016 race for vice president.\n\nDuterte loyalists have meanwhile been urging the still hugely popular president to run as vice-president. This would enable him to continue wielding power by skirting a six-year term limit put in place during the presidency of Corazon Aquino.\n\nThe 1986 constitution included a single term provision to try and prevent a repeat of the Marcos dictatorship.\n\nPeter Mumford, a Southeast Asia analyst at Eurasia Group, thinks the passing of Aquino could boost support for his Liberal Party, which has been flagging in the polls.\n\n\u201cHowever, comparisons with Aquino III\u2019s political rise following the deaths of his parents and the current situation need to be made with caution,\u201d Mumford told Nikkei Asia.\n\n\u201cAquino\u2019s parents were even more popular and revered. Plus, in 2010 there was not a highly popular outgoing president able to whip up mass support for their chosen successor \u2013 as is the case with Duterte now.\u201d\n\nBob Herrera-Lim, an analyst at Teneo, an advisory company, said Aquino\u2019s death \u201cwill eventually deprive supporters of Duterte a common target for their populist attacks\u201d and likely \u201clead to a shift in tactics for the administration\u201d.\n\nThe former president\u2019s passing \u201cwill signal an introspection\u201d ahead of the 2022 presidential elections, said Edna Co, a public administration professor at the University of the Philippines.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not whether we are a fan of PNoy or not,\u201d Co said, using the former president\u2019s popular moniker. \u201cIt\u2019s an introspection of what kind of leadership we had and we would like to have in 2022.\u201d\n\nWhile the dynastic shifts will be closely followed, Co said it would be better if next year\u2019s elections focus more on governance than political clans.\n\n\u201cThe Philippines has been trapped in dynastic politics, but this is already the 21st century,\u201d Co said. \u201cThe next election should be about democratic governance, regardless of who brings it \u2013 I don\u2019t care whether it is a Marcos, Aquino or Duterte.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["marcos", "upper", "gives", "aquino", "popular", "presidents",

Malaysia Used Vehicle Autoparts Traders Association (MUVATA) has called upon the government to clarify the position of new and used automotive parts importers, exporters, wholesalers and retailers it represents to be classified under the spare parts sector, the association wrote in an e-mailed statement.\n\nThe association pleads with the ministry of domestic trade and consumer affairs (KPDNHEP) to clarify that businesses dealing in auto parts are under the spare parts sector, which have been allowed to operate, along with car workshops and tyre shops, under FMCO conditions as of June 1.\n\nIt states that most of its members have received approval to operate from the Covid-19 intelligent management system (CIMS) 3.0 under the purview of the ministry of international trade and industry (MITI), having selected peruncitan, pengedaran dan pemborongan (retail, distribution or wholesaling), with the sub-sectors of bengkel, penyelenggaraan dan alat ganti (workshops, maintenance and spare parts).\n\nReports have, however, been received from a few of its members in Johor Bahru, said MUVATA, saying they have been told by the Johor Bahru City Council (MBJB) that they are to shut down immediately as they are deemed not to be categorised under the auto parts sector, and an MBJB officer said that the alat ganti term for permitted businesses is only applicable to those trading in new auto parts, the statement read.\n\nA similar situation was reportedly encountered by the association\u2019s members in Perak, where the police have deemed the businesses\u2019 selected category on the forms to be incorrect, and therefore have also been told to shut down. MUVATA says that used auto parts business operators are now very confused, and some have not dared to remain open for fear of receiving hefty fines, it said, adding that \u201cguidelines need to be clear and consistent, otherwise [it] will burden the industry.\u201d\n\nIn terms of operations, MUVATA hopes that the authorities understand that unlike businesses trading in new auto parts, traders of used parts need to carry out minor dismantling work in order to obtain said used parts, such as by taking apart a large group of components to acquire smaller, individual parts.\n\nThe association suggests that enforcement agencies have perhaps misunderstood used auto parts as being under the manufacturing sector, and therefore have not allowed essential auto parts businesses to operate, and clarifies that the parts selection processes are purely to the customers\u2019 requirements.\n\n\u201cWe wish to convey that it is crucial for new and used auto parts to go hand-in-hand with workshops, as it is useless for workshops to operate without auto parts, new or used,\u201d the statement from MUVATA read. It adds that the logistics sector, which serves transportation for medicine, food and beverage, is reliant on repairs and servicing, and that disruptions in parts supply may see workshops face major challenges.\n\nAccording to an internal survey held by MUVATA, 20% of its members have stated that they are unable to survive, and would be forced to close down if the lockdown is prolonged. While the auto parts sector is listed as an essential category, its members\u2019 business volume has dropped by nearly 70% in this full movement control order (FMCO), it said.\n\nThe association also asks for the government to allow used auto parts companies with the relevant approval letters to operate with a workforce of 60%, for businesses including wholesale, export and the dismantling and sorting of auto parts, and not just for selling to local workshops. In closing, the MUVATA statement reads that \u201cthe industry welcomes the automatic bank loan moratorium, as well as the extension and enhancement of the wage subsidy programme.\u201d\n\nUpon the FMCO taking effect on June 1, vehicle repair (body and paint) and service centres have been allowed to operate at 60% worker capacity, KPDNHEP minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi said at the time. MUVATA also calls for the acceleration of the mass immunisation programme, including for the auto parts sectors as its members\u2019 personnel are customer-facing and therefore are frontliners, as they have to be physically present to discharge their duties and tasks.\n\nMeanwhile in the area of new vehicles, sales are expected to approach zero for the month of June as showrooms nationwide are closed due to the FMCO, with significant financial impact, reported Berita Harian last week. Based on an average vehicle price of RM70,000, the country\u2019s automotive industry is set to lose around RM3.44 billion in revenue due to the sales slump.", "keyword": ["operate", "used",

order prior to this.\n\nReferring to the National People's Well-Being and Economic Recovery Package (Pemulih), he said that the aid package was balanced and coincided with the current situation and could assure that the country would win in fight against Covid-19 for the well-being and survival of the people.\n\n\u201cKPDNHEP truly appreciates the concern of the government which is committed to alleviating the cost of living of the people by continuing the policy of controlling the prices of essential items, among others maintaining the retail prices of petrol RON95, diesel and LPG involving subsidies of over RM6 billion a year,\u201d he said in a statement, today.\n\nAccording to Nanta, the ministry recorded its appreciation to the government for accepting the unsubsidised cooking oil price management mechanism proposal to tackle the issue of cooking oil price hike in one kilogramme (kg) to five kg bottles.\n\nTowards this end, KPDNHEP would co-operate with the relevant ministries in implementing the price control based on the Crude Palm Oil (CPO) threshold value and ensure the price of a five kg bottle of cooking oil would not exceed RM30.\n\nThe ministry also lauded an additional allocation of RM1 billion to ensure the supply of subsidised cooking oil in one kg polybags is guaranteed and is available at a subsidised price of RM2.50.\n\nIn addition, the ministry fully supported the Small Entrepreneur Digitalisation Empowering Programme (Pupuk) with an allocation of RM200 million for micro, small and medium enterprises (PMKS) and RM100 million for small and medium enterprises to boost the national digitalisation agenda.\n\nKPDNHEP too had for a long time mobilised the digitalisation programme either at the ministerial level or in the distribution trade sector through various applications such as ez-Aduan, Price Catcher, My Sales Tracker, MyHarga, Spacedeal, Chatbot Sara and ReDI.\n\nNanta said the ministry has started a special immunisation programme for economic frontliners so that the country could move towards the opening up of more economic sectors when all involved have undergone full immunisation. \u2015 Bernama", "keyword":

If there is any honour left in them, they would have resigned.\n\nThere is no excuse and they cannot expect to be fined like other citizens because they represent the SOPs (standard operating procedures), the MCOs and supported the Emergency and everything that came with it.\n\nWhile most opinions tend to be more forgiving of Mustapa and the brunt reserved for Mohd Rashid, ultimately, the wrongs they committed were of equal proportion.\n\nNo doubt, there had been other leaders from the government who had breached the SOPs. By now, whether they got punished or fined just like other ordinary citizens is no longer the issue.\n\nThe offenders from the government should actually tender their resignations and not pass the burden of rectifying their wrongs to the police or other enforcement bodies.\n\nSuch expectations are actually too highly placed, in fact almost delusionary.\n\nHowever, if Prime Minister (PM) Tan Sri Mahiaddin Md Yassin and other senior leaders in the government are still clueless as to why public disaffection towards them is not just simmering but reaching boiling point, they should be told that they suffer from trust deficit from all aspects of governance and administration.\n\nThe issue of being a backdoor government, not having legitimacy and backstabbing their political friends have taken a backseat and overtaken by their inefficiency, flip-flops, ineptitude, double-standards, shady deals, incompetence, cluelessness and repeat all these many folds.\n\nBecause of their inability to rule and manage the nation, all their past sins are catching up with them.\n\nThen there is the tendency of putting their foot in their mouth \u2014 one example is the quote that he can\u2019t be expected to take care of all 32 million Malaysians.\n\nIt may sound honest, but anyone accepting the top post in the government, especially when no one had put the gun to his or her head, meant that the whole populace, whether they are supporters or doubters or opponents, all and sundry are the leader\u2019s responsibility.\n\nIt is then no surprise that today, as the \u201cwhite flag\u201d campaign gathers momentum, it signifies the loss of confidence in the government to resolve their ails and they would probably by now accept they are the ones that did not make it to the list of citizens that the leader could take care of.\n\nA PAS leader who tried to mock the campaign \u2014 aimed at getting those who are too ashamed to seek assistance to put up the flag to signify their desperation \u2014 was either in denial or being defensive as he is part of the \u201cfailed government\u201d.\n\nRoundly censured, PAS is yet another component of the ruling coalition that adds to the missteps of the government, which even without is already overflowing the brim.\n\nIf opinions and actions are insufficient to add to the woes or being publicly denounced, even a prepared statement from the PM\u2019s Office regarding Mahiaddin\u2019s health did not pass public scrutiny.\n\nIn the first place, it is incomprehensible why his office chose to share the one detail that led to the PM being hospitalised and placed under observation.\n\nBy any standards, no one discussed such conditions publicly as problems of the bowel movements at best would only be shared with doctors or in the days of yore, with the dukun or shaman master, or maybe not given their prowess of insights of knowing even without being told.\n\nInstead of sympathy or at least a short truce until the PM is discharged, the choice of word in the statement went trending and nuanced creatively to mock and undermine the government of the day. While it can be dismissed as petty, any discerning and sensitive leader would know that the government has totally lost both the plot and public confidence.\n\nAnd they can only salvage some redemption by exiting.", "keyword": ["sops", "goodwill", "leaders", "statement", "rashid", "issue", "left", "spare", "nary", "wrongs", "citizens", "leader", "public"], "summary": "While most opinions tend to be more forgiving of Mustapa and the brunt reserved for Mohd Rashid, ultimately, the wrongs they committed were of equal proportion.\nNo doubt, there had been other leaders from the government who had breached the SOPs.\nBy now, whether they got punished or fined just like other ordinary citizens is no longer the issue.\nBecause of their inability to rule and manage the nation, all their past sins are catching up with them.\nWhile it can be dismissed as petty, any discerning and sensitive leader would know that the government has totally lost both the plot and public confidence.", "news": "The Malaysian Reserve", "date": "2021-07-02 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Prioritise passion over academic qualifications in teacher recruitment, says NUTP", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mcmVlbWFsYXlzaWF0b2RheS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbmF0aW9uLzIwMjEvMDYvMjUvcHJpb3JpdGlzZS1wYXNzaW9uLW92ZXItYWNhZGVtaWMtcXVhbGlmaWNhdGlvbnMtaW4tdGVhY2hlci1yZWNydWl0bWVudC1zYXlzLW51dHAv0gEA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Fmt Reporters"], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SCHOOL_TEACHERS_MCO_SOP_SMK_DATO_ONN_KUALA_LUMPUR_FMT_24062020-3-2.jpg", "text": "PETALING JAYA: The National Union of the Teaching Profession (NUTP) says only those with aptitude and passion for teaching, and not simply the best academically qualified, should be recruited into the profession.\n\nThis is because not everyone who is academically qualified turns out to be a good teacher.\n\nIts secretary-general Harry Tan urged the education ministry to \u201csearch every nook and corner and turn every stone to ensure only the best were selected as the profession was undergoing challenging times that needed teachers who were willing to face them.\n\n\u201cIf you select just about anyone who wants a job, he or she may not be able to empathise with the students, and they will be left out.\n\n\u201cThis is besides ensuring that the candidate must be trained for the job by an accredited institution,\u201d he told FMT when contacted.\n\nTan said priority should also be given to those who were strong bilinguals or who were proficient in more than one language, as this would be a great asset.\n\n\u201cThe post-Covid-19 era requires teachers of different calibre with multiple talents.

The two are Kelantan Umno chief and Machang MP Ahmad Jazlan Yaakub, and Padang Rengas MP Nazri Aziz, while Gua Musang MP Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah said he refused to back Muhyiddin as prime minister.\n\nCheng said a few MPs may jump ship to support Muhyiddin\u2019s administration.

A funeral mass began at 10am local time, at the Ateneo de Manila University, Aquino\u2019s alma mater, where his funeral urn had been on view on Friday.\n\nAquino\u2019s passing comes as the political landscape shifts in a country dominated by dynasties.\n\nIn recent years, President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s clan based in the south of the Philippines has been dominant. With Duterte patronage, the family of former president and dictator Ferdinand Marcos \u2013 the nemesis of the Aquinos \u2013 has seen its fortunes revive.\n\nAquino\u2019s sudden death prompted much reflection on his six-year term, which ended in 2016 and saw the economic revival of the so called \u201csick man of Asia\u201d.\n\nPresident Duterte declared 10 days of national mourning and called Aquino\u2019s death \u201can opportunity to unite in prayer and set aside our differences\u201d.\n\nAquino, the country\u2019s 15th president, was inaugurated in June 2010 following a landslide election win delivered on the back of a strong anti-graft campaign.\n\nThe former senator had not been his party\u2019s first choice, but calls for him to run mounted after the death in August 2009 of his mother, Corazon Aquino, a former president. For supporters, an Aquino was the answer to the massive corruption plaguing the country.\n\n\u201cI accept the plea of the nation. I also accept the instructions of my parents. I accept the responsibility to continue the fight for our country,\u201d Aquino said when he declared his candidacy.\n\nThat was just 40 days after his mother\u2019s death, and he was speaking in the same venue where she took her oath of office in 1986. Many regarded it as a moment of history repeating itself.\n\nAquino\u2019s father, Sen Benigno \u201cNinoy\u201d Aquino Jr, was assassinated in 1983 on the tarmac of Manila International Airport \u2013 subsequently renamed in his honour \u2013 as he returned from exile in the US.\n\nThe opposition leader\u2019s callous murder was the catalyst for People Power, the revolutionary movement that brought down the Marcos dictatorship and catapulted Corazon Aquino, a housewife, into the presidency.\n\nAlthough he arrived in office on the coattails of his parents, Aquino went on to create a significant legacy in this own right.\n\nHis sound economic management and image of incorruptibility inspired confidence from investors long spooked by crooked politics, coup attempts and corruption scandals.\n\nOn Aquino\u2019s watch, gross domestic product mushroomed to an average of 6% annually, the largest in 40 years. Annual foreign direct investment rose to US$8.3 billion in 2016 from just US$2 billion before he entered office. The country\u2019s credit ratings all went up.\n\nThe last president also strengthened the old defence alliance with the US In 2013, he challenged China\u2019s expansion claims in the disputed South China Sea.\n\nThe country\u2019s most powerful neighbour lost international arbitration at The Hague in a ruling handed down a week after Aquino left office. China never recognised the court\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cPresident Aquino\u2019s steadfast commitment to advancing peace, upholding the rule of law, and driving economic growth for all Filipinos, while taking bold steps to promote the rules-based international order, leaves a remarkable legacy at home and abroad that will endure for the years to come,\u201d US President Joe Biden said in a statement.\n\nBut for all his international prestige, reducing domestic poverty and social inequality remained stubborn challenges for Aquino. That created an opening for Duterte \u2013 an outsider who advocated strongarm tactics against national problems.\n\nA week before the 2016 elections, Aquino warned voters off Duterte, implying that he had the makings of a dictator.\n\nStill the mayor of Davao City in the southern province of Mindanao broke the Manila hold on politics and won by a landslide with over six million votes more than closest rival Mar Roxas, Aquino\u2019s anointed successor.\n\nDuterte\u2019s presidency has been markedly different on all scores. He embraced China and distanced himself from the US.\n\nHe launched a brutal drugs war that has killed thousands of alleged offenders \u2013 a bloody campaign that while popular at home was heavily condemned abroad. Duterte also cracked down on business elites associated with Aquino to rally support.\n\nSome regarded Aquino as elitist, and Duterte\u2019s ordinary man image appealed to many Filipinos. The president\u2019s popularity has not waned, and his brash politics have eclipsed the Aquino brand.\n\nIn the 2019 mid-term elections, Duterte-allied candidates, including his former aide Bong Go and police chief Ronald Dela Rosa, won most of the 12 seats on the table. Aquino\u2019s cousin, Paolo Benigno \u201cBam\u201d Aquino IV, meanwhile failed to get re-elected.\n\nAlthough Duterte enjoys overwhelming support, Aquino\u2019s death could have some impact on the political scene, analysts believe.\n\nIt has come less than a year ahead of the May 2022 presidential elections. The early frontrunner is Sara Duterte, the president\u2019s daughter and mayor of Davao.\n\nFerdinand Marcos Jr, \u2013 a former senator and the son of the late president, has also emerged as a strong contender in opinion polls. Marcos lost by a slim margin to Aquino-backed Leni Robredo in the 2016 race for vice president.\n\nDuterte loyalists have meanwhile been urging the still hugely popular president to run as vice-president. This would enable him to continue wielding power by skirting a six-year term limit put in place during the presidency of Corazon Aquino.\n\nThe 1986 constitution included a single term provision to try and prevent a repeat of the Marcos dictatorship.\n\nPeter Mumford, a Southeast Asia analyst at Eurasia Group, thinks the passing of Aquino could boost support for his Liberal Party, which has been flagging in the polls.\n\n\u201cHowever, comparisons with Aquino III\u2019s political rise following the deaths of his parents and the current situation need to be made with caution,\u201d Mumford told Nikkei Asia.\n\n\u201cAquino\u2019s parents were even more popular and revered. Plus, in 2010 there was not a highly popular outgoing president able to whip up mass support for their chosen successor \u2013 as is the case with Duterte now.\u201d\n\nBob Herrera-Lim, an analyst at Teneo, an advisory company, said Aquino\u2019s death \u201cwill eventually deprive supporters of Duterte a common target for their populist attacks\u201d and likely \u201clead to a shift in tactics for the administration\u201d.\n\nThe former president\u2019s passing \u201cwill signal an introspection\u201d ahead of the 2022 presidential elections, said Edna Co, a public administration professor at the University of the Philippines.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not whether we are a fan of PNoy or not,\u201d Co said, using the former president\u2019s popular moniker. \u201cIt\u2019s an introspection of what kind of leadership we had and we would like to have in 2022.\u201d\n\nWhile the dynastic shifts will be closely followed, Co said it would be better if next year\u2019s elections focus more on governance than political clans.\n\n\u201cThe Philippines has been trapped in dynastic politics, but this is already the 21st century,\u201d Co said. \u201cThe next election should be about democratic governance, regardless of who brings it \u2013 I don\u2019t care whether it is a Marcos, Aquino or Duterte.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["marcos", "upper", "gives", "aquino", "popular", "presidents",

Malaysia Used Vehicle Autoparts Traders Association (MUVATA) has called upon the government to clarify the position of new and used automotive parts importers, exporters, wholesalers and retailers it represents to be classified under the spare parts sector, the association wrote in an e-mailed statement.\n\nThe association pleads with the ministry of domestic trade and consumer affairs (KPDNHEP) to clarify that businesses dealing in auto parts are under the spare parts sector, which have been allowed to operate, along with car workshops and tyre shops, under FMCO conditions as of June 1.\n\nIt states that most of its members have received approval to operate from the Covid-19 intelligent management system (CIMS) 3.0 under the purview of the ministry of international trade and industry (MITI), having selected peruncitan, pengedaran dan pemborongan (retail, distribution or wholesaling), with the sub-sectors of bengkel, penyelenggaraan dan alat ganti (workshops, maintenance and spare parts).\n\nReports have, however, been received from a few of its members in Johor Bahru, said MUVATA, saying they have been told by the Johor Bahru City Council (MBJB) that they are to shut down immediately as they are deemed not to be categorised under the auto parts sector, and an MBJB officer said that the alat ganti term for permitted businesses is only applicable to those trading in new auto parts, the statement read.\n\nA similar situation was reportedly encountered by the association\u2019s members in Perak, where the police have deemed the businesses\u2019 selected category on the forms to be incorrect, and therefore have also been told to shut down. MUVATA says that used auto parts business operators are now very confused, and some have not dared to remain open for fear of receiving hefty fines, it said, adding that \u201cguidelines need to be clear and consistent, otherwise [it] will burden the industry.\u201d\n\nIn terms of operations, MUVATA hopes that the authorities understand that unlike businesses trading in new auto parts, traders of used parts need to carry out minor dismantling work in order to obtain said used parts, such as by taking apart a large group of components to acquire smaller, individual parts.\n\nThe association suggests that enforcement agencies have perhaps misunderstood used auto parts as being under the manufacturing sector, and therefore have not allowed essential auto parts businesses to operate, and clarifies that the parts selection processes are purely to the customers\u2019 requirements.\n\n\u201cWe wish to convey that it is crucial for new and used auto parts to go hand-in-hand with workshops, as it is useless for workshops to operate without auto parts, new or used,\u201d the statement from MUVATA read. It adds that the logistics sector, which serves transportation for medicine, food and beverage, is reliant on repairs and servicing, and that disruptions in parts supply may see workshops face major challenges.\n\nAccording to an internal survey held by MUVATA, 20% of its members have stated that they are unable to survive, and would be forced to close down if the lockdown is prolonged. While the auto parts sector is listed as an essential category, its members\u2019 business volume has dropped by nearly 70% in this full movement control order (FMCO), it said.\n\nThe association also asks for the government to allow used auto parts companies with the relevant approval letters to operate with a workforce of 60%, for businesses including wholesale, export and the dismantling and sorting of auto parts, and not just for selling to local workshops. In closing, the MUVATA statement reads that \u201cthe industry welcomes the automatic bank loan moratorium, as well as the extension and enhancement of the wage subsidy programme.\u201d\n\nUpon the FMCO taking effect on June 1, vehicle repair (body and paint) and service centres have been allowed to operate at 60% worker capacity, KPDNHEP minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi said at the time. MUVATA also calls for the acceleration of the mass immunisation programme, including for the auto parts sectors as its members\u2019 personnel are customer-facing and therefore are frontliners, as they have to be physically present to discharge their duties and tasks.\n\nMeanwhile in the area of new vehicles, sales are expected to approach zero for the month of June as showrooms nationwide are closed due to the FMCO, with significant financial impact, reported Berita Harian last week. Based on an average vehicle price of RM70,000, the country\u2019s automotive industry is set to lose around RM3.44 billion in revenue due to the sales slump.", "keyword": ["operate", "used",

If there is any honour left in them, they would have resigned.\n\nThere is no excuse and they cannot expect to be fined like other citizens because they represent the SOPs (standard operating procedures), the MCOs and supported the Emergency and everything that came with it.\n\nWhile most opinions tend to be more forgiving of Mustapa and the brunt reserved for Mohd Rashid, ultimately, the wrongs they committed were of equal proportion.\n\nNo doubt, there had been other leaders from the government who had breached the SOPs. By now, whether they got punished or fined just like other ordinary citizens is no longer the issue.\n\nThe offenders from the government should actually tender their resignations and not pass the burden of rectifying their wrongs to the police or other enforcement bodies.\n\nSuch expectations are actually too highly placed, in fact almost delusionary.\n\nHowever, if Prime Minister (PM) Tan Sri Mahiaddin Md Yassin and other senior leaders in the government are still clueless as to why public disaffection towards them is not just simmering but reaching boiling point, they should be told that they suffer from trust deficit from all aspects of governance and administration.\n\nThe issue of being a backdoor government, not having legitimacy and backstabbing their political friends have taken a backseat and overtaken by their inefficiency, flip-flops, ineptitude, double-standards, shady deals, incompetence, cluelessness and repeat all these many folds.\n\nBecause of their inability to rule and manage the nation, all their past sins are catching up with them.\n\nThen there is the tendency of putting their foot in their mouth \u2014 one example is the quote that he can\u2019t be expected to take care of all 32 million Malaysians.\n\nIt may sound honest, but anyone accepting the top post in the government, especially when no one had put the gun to his or her head, meant that the whole populace, whether they are supporters or doubters or opponents, all and sundry are the leader\u2019s responsibility.\n\nIt is then no surprise that today, as the \u201cwhite flag\u201d campaign gathers momentum, it signifies the loss of confidence in the government to resolve their ails and they would probably by now accept they are the ones that did not make it to the list of citizens that the leader could take care of.\n\nA PAS leader who tried to mock the campaign \u2014 aimed at getting those who are too ashamed to seek assistance to put up the flag to signify their desperation \u2014 was either in denial or being defensive as he is part of the \u201cfailed government\u201d.\n\nRoundly censured, PAS is yet another component of the ruling coalition that adds to the missteps of the government, which even without is already overflowing the brim.\n\nIf opinions and actions are insufficient to add to the woes or being publicly denounced, even a prepared statement from the PM\u2019s Office regarding Mahiaddin\u2019s health did not pass public scrutiny.\n\nIn the first place, it is incomprehensible why his office chose to share the one detail that led to the PM being hospitalised and placed under observation.\n\nBy any standards, no one discussed such conditions publicly as problems of the bowel movements at best would only be shared with doctors or in the days of yore, with the dukun or shaman master, or maybe not given their prowess of insights of knowing even without being told.\n\nInstead of sympathy or at least a short truce until the PM is discharged, the choice of word in the statement went trending and nuanced creatively to mock and undermine the government of the day.

Also, some developers are offering buyers to rent with an option to purchase,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve (TMR).\n\nCCO & Associates (KL) Sdn Bhd ED Chan Wai Seen said the rental for residential properties has undergone adjustments since 2015 and many landlords have been charging low rentals in order to attract tenants.\n\n\u201cGenerally, rental rates for newly completed projects or properties located nearby new projects will continue to be highly competitive. Rental rates may gradually improve when properties located within the new projects have achieved high occupancy rates.\n\n\u201cWith the large number of affordable properties coming into the market, we expect rental will remain at a highly competitive level,\u201d he told TMR.\n\nAreca Capital Sdn Bhd CEO Danny Wong Teck Meng said there are two schools of thought.\n\nFirstly, that the supply glut of residential properties is still hanging thus affecting the rental market; and on the other hand, many working adults now prefer to rent rather than buy properties.\n\nWong is of the opinion that it highly depends on the location, adding that the rental market is still soft for the time being.\n\nAsiacap Valuers & Property Consultants Sdn Bhd property valuer Kit Au Yong surmised the property market to remain in a soft condition in 2H21 going into 1H22, with possibly slow gradual improvement in 2H22.\n\n\u201cWe maintain a cautious view about the property market performance. However, the market is treading carefully in response to the current volatile unprecedented short- to mid-term condition,\u201d he said.\n\nLast year\u2019s pandemic shock immensely hurt Malaysia\u2019s economy with its GDP contracting 5.6%.\n\nThis year, the GDP is projected to recover at about 5%-6%.\n\nIn April, Finance Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz said Malaysia\u2019s property market in 2020 experienced a decrease of 9.9% in volume of transactions and 15.8% in value of transactions compared to 2019.\n\nAccording to Property Market 1Q21 Snapshot, Malaysia recorded 80,694 transactions, a contraction of 11.6% compared to 4Q20.\n\nThe government has introduced the Prihatin Rakyat Economic Stimulus Package and the Short-term Economic Recovery Plan, as well as allocations and incentives to help cushion the negative impact on the property market such as the stamp duty exemption.", "keyword": ["better", "rent", "transactions", "market", "property", "demand", "improve", "remain", "properties", "residential", "rental", "economic"], "summary": "\u201cUnable to commit to a purchase, the only option available for those who require accommodation is to rent, hence the residential market will improve.\nFirstly, that the supply glut of residential properties is still hanging thus affecting the rental market; and on the other hand, many working adults now prefer to rent rather than buy properties.\nWong is of the opinion that it highly depends on the location, adding that the rental market is still soft for the time being.\n\u201cWe maintain a cautious view about the property market performance.\nAccording to Property Market 1Q21 Snapshot, Malaysia recorded 80,694 transactions, a contraction of 11.6% compared to 4Q20.", "news": "The Malaysian Reserve", "date": "2021-07-01 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Opposition can\u2019t make headway without a PM candidate, says analyst", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wNi8yMi9vcHBvc2l0aW9uLWNhbnQtbWFrZS1oZWFkd2F5LXdpdGhvdXQtYS1wbS1jYW5kaWRhdGUtc2F5cy1hbmFseXN0L9IBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Minderjeet Kaur"], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FMT-AHMAD-ZAHID-HAMIDI-02.jpg", "text": "PETALING JAYA: Umno and Pakatan Harapan are not likely to call for a confidence vote against Muhyiddin Yassin unless they have agreed on a candidate to be the new prime minister, and until the Covid-19 crisis is under control, say political analysts.\n\nFormer academic Azmi Hassan said Umno\u2019s two-week ultimatum to Muhyiddin was to force the Perikatan Nasional government to do \u201csomething positive\u201d.\n\nUmno president Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said yesterday he gave the PN-led government 14 days to reconvene Parliament.\n\nAzmi said Umno was using the opportunity to put PN in an awkward position.\n\n\u201cThey know (that a Parliament sitting) is not achievable at least until the end of July but they may feel this is the best way to force PN\u2019s hand,\u201d he told FMT.\n\nHe said it was unlikely that any political party would call for a confidence vote against the prime minister when Parliament sits, as the rakyat may accuse the politicians of putting their self-interest above public health.\n\n\u201cThe health issue needs to be addressed first. After that comes jobs, as many people are jobless,\u201d he added.\n\nHowever, he said Umno and Pakatan Harapan may make life difficult for the governing party by not supporting any bills that are presented. \u201cThat\u2019s where problems may arise.\u201d\n\nThose who intended to push for the confidence vote should have a candidate for a new prime minister ready, in case the present government fails to garner a sufficient majority, he said.\n\nKenneth Cheng, a member of the Agora Society, a loose network of intellectuals, told FMT that Umno will only be able to initiate real changes if elections are called.\n\nHe said that even if the party were to withdraw from the government now, it would need to agree with other parties on a prime ministerial candidate.\n\nLast week, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong issued a statement that Parliament should reconvene as soon as possible. A day earlier, Muhyiddin had said that Parliament could meet by September or October at the earliest and only if daily Covid-19 cases dropped below 2,000.\n\nCheng said not all Umno ministers may withdraw from the government in the midst of the pandemic.\n\nUmno would have a better chance of governing the country after a general election as it is expected to gain ground support from rural and urban Malays, he said.\n\n\u201cUntil then, Umno will have to strategise its moves,\u201d he added.\n\nCheng added that it is unclear if Muhyiddin still holds a majority in the Dewan Rakyat, especially after two Umno MPs said they have withdrawn their support. The two are Kelantan Umno chief and Machang MP Ahmad Jazlan Yaakub, and Padang Rengas MP Nazri Aziz, while Gua Musang MP Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah said he refused to back Muhyiddin as prime minister.\n\nCheng said a few MPs may jump ship to support Muhyiddin\u2019s administration.

A funeral mass began at 10am local time, at the Ateneo de Manila University, Aquino\u2019s alma mater, where his funeral urn had been on view on Friday.\n\nAquino\u2019s passing comes as the political landscape shifts in a country dominated by dynasties.\n\nIn recent years, President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s clan based in the south of the Philippines has been dominant. With Duterte patronage, the family of former president and dictator Ferdinand Marcos \u2013 the nemesis of the Aquinos \u2013 has seen its fortunes revive.\n\nAquino\u2019s sudden death prompted much reflection on his six-year term, which ended in 2016 and saw the economic revival of the so called \u201csick man of Asia\u201d.\n\nPresident Duterte declared 10 days of national mourning and called Aquino\u2019s death \u201can opportunity to unite in prayer and set aside our differences\u201d.\n\nAquino, the country\u2019s 15th president, was inaugurated in June 2010 following a landslide election win delivered on the back of a strong anti-graft campaign.\n\nThe former senator had not been his party\u2019s first choice, but calls for him to run mounted after the death in August 2009 of his mother, Corazon Aquino, a former president. For supporters, an Aquino was the answer to the massive corruption plaguing the country.\n\n\u201cI accept the plea of the nation. I also accept the instructions of my parents. I accept the responsibility to continue the fight for our country,\u201d Aquino said when he declared his candidacy.\n\nThat was just 40 days after his mother\u2019s death, and he was speaking in the same venue where she took her oath of office in 1986. Many regarded it as a moment of history repeating itself.\n\nAquino\u2019s father, Sen Benigno \u201cNinoy\u201d Aquino Jr, was assassinated in 1983 on the tarmac of Manila International Airport \u2013 subsequently renamed in his honour \u2013 as he returned from exile in the US.\n\nThe opposition leader\u2019s callous murder was the catalyst for People Power, the revolutionary movement that brought down the Marcos dictatorship and catapulted Corazon Aquino, a housewife, into the presidency.\n\nAlthough he arrived in office on the coattails of his parents, Aquino went on to create a significant legacy in this own right.\n\nHis sound economic management and image of incorruptibility inspired confidence from investors long spooked by crooked politics, coup attempts and corruption scandals.\n\nOn Aquino\u2019s watch, gross domestic product mushroomed to an average of 6% annually, the largest in 40 years. Annual foreign direct investment rose to US$8.3 billion in 2016 from just US$2 billion before he entered office. The country\u2019s credit ratings all went up.\n\nThe last president also strengthened the old defence alliance with the US In 2013, he challenged China\u2019s expansion claims in the disputed South China Sea.\n\nThe country\u2019s most powerful neighbour lost international arbitration at The Hague in a ruling handed down a week after Aquino left office. China never recognised the court\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cPresident Aquino\u2019s steadfast commitment to advancing peace, upholding the rule of law, and driving economic growth for all Filipinos, while taking bold steps to promote the rules-based international order, leaves a remarkable legacy at home and abroad that will endure for the years to come,\u201d US President Joe Biden said in a statement.\n\nBut for all his international prestige, reducing domestic poverty and social inequality remained stubborn challenges for Aquino. That created an opening for Duterte \u2013 an outsider who advocated strongarm tactics against national problems.\n\nA week before the 2016 elections, Aquino warned voters off Duterte, implying that he had the makings of a dictator.\n\nStill the mayor of Davao City in the southern province of Mindanao broke the Manila hold on politics and won by a landslide with over six million votes more than closest rival Mar Roxas, Aquino\u2019s anointed successor.\n\nDuterte\u2019s presidency has been markedly different on all scores. He embraced China and distanced himself from the US.\n\nHe launched a brutal drugs war that has killed thousands of alleged offenders \u2013 a bloody campaign that while popular at home was heavily condemned abroad. Duterte also cracked down on business elites associated with Aquino to rally support.\n\nSome regarded Aquino as elitist, and Duterte\u2019s ordinary man image appealed to many Filipinos. The president\u2019s popularity has not waned, and his brash politics have eclipsed the Aquino brand.\n\nIn the 2019 mid-term elections, Duterte-allied candidates, including his former aide Bong Go and police chief Ronald Dela Rosa, won most of the 12 seats on the table. Aquino\u2019s cousin, Paolo Benigno \u201cBam\u201d Aquino IV, meanwhile failed to get re-elected.\n\nAlthough Duterte enjoys overwhelming support, Aquino\u2019s death could have some impact on the political scene, analysts believe.\n\nIt has come less than a year ahead of the May 2022 presidential elections. The early frontrunner is Sara Duterte, the president\u2019s daughter and mayor of Davao.\n\nFerdinand Marcos Jr, \u2013 a former senator and the son of the late president, has also emerged as a strong contender in opinion polls. Marcos lost by a slim margin to Aquino-backed Leni Robredo in the 2016 race for vice president.\n\nDuterte loyalists have meanwhile been urging the still hugely popular president to run as vice-president. This would enable him to continue wielding power by skirting a six-year term limit put in place during the presidency of Corazon Aquino.\n\nThe 1986 constitution included a single term provision to try and prevent a repeat of the Marcos dictatorship.\n\nPeter Mumford, a Southeast Asia analyst at Eurasia Group, thinks the passing of Aquino could boost support for his Liberal Party, which has been flagging in the polls.\n\n\u201cHowever, comparisons with Aquino III\u2019s political rise following the deaths of his parents and the current situation need to be made with caution,\u201d Mumford told Nikkei Asia.\n\n\u201cAquino\u2019s parents were even more popular and revered. Plus, in 2010 there was not a highly popular outgoing president able to whip up mass support for their chosen successor \u2013 as is the case with Duterte now.\u201d\n\nBob Herrera-Lim, an analyst at Teneo, an advisory company, said Aquino\u2019s death \u201cwill eventually deprive supporters of Duterte a common target for their populist attacks\u201d and likely \u201clead to a shift in tactics for the administration\u201d.\n\nThe former president\u2019s passing \u201cwill signal an introspection\u201d ahead of the 2022 presidential elections, said Edna Co, a public administration professor at the University of the Philippines.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not whether we are a fan of PNoy or not,\u201d Co said, using the former president\u2019s popular moniker. \u201cIt\u2019s an introspection of what kind of leadership we had and we would like to have in 2022.\u201d\n\nWhile the dynastic shifts will be closely followed, Co said it would be better if next year\u2019s elections focus more on governance than political clans.\n\n\u201cThe Philippines has been trapped in dynastic politics, but this is already the 21st century,\u201d Co said. \u201cThe next election should be about democratic governance, regardless of who brings it \u2013 I don\u2019t care whether it is a Marcos, Aquino or Duterte.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["marcos", "upper", "gives", "aquino", "popular", "presidents",

Malaysia Used Vehicle Autoparts Traders Association (MUVATA) has called upon the government to clarify the position of new and used automotive parts importers, exporters, wholesalers and retailers it represents to be classified under the spare parts sector, the association wrote in an e-mailed statement.\n\nThe association pleads with the ministry of domestic trade and consumer affairs (KPDNHEP) to clarify that businesses dealing in auto parts are under the spare parts sector, which have been allowed to operate, along with car workshops and tyre shops, under FMCO conditions as of June 1.\n\nIt states that most of its members have received approval to operate from the Covid-19 intelligent management system (CIMS) 3.0 under the purview of the ministry of international trade and industry (MITI), having selected peruncitan, pengedaran dan pemborongan (retail, distribution or wholesaling), with the sub-sectors of bengkel, penyelenggaraan dan alat ganti (workshops, maintenance and spare parts).\n\nReports have, however, been received from a few of its members in Johor Bahru, said MUVATA, saying they have been told by the Johor Bahru City Council (MBJB) that they are to shut down immediately as they are deemed not to be categorised under the auto parts sector, and an MBJB officer said that the alat ganti term for permitted businesses is only applicable to those trading in new auto parts, the statement read.\n\nA similar situation was reportedly encountered by the association\u2019s members in Perak, where the police have deemed the businesses\u2019 selected category on the forms to be incorrect, and therefore have also been told to shut down. MUVATA says that used auto parts business operators are now very confused, and some have not dared to remain open for fear of receiving hefty fines, it said, adding that \u201cguidelines need to be clear and consistent, otherwise [it] will burden the industry.\u201d\n\nIn terms of operations, MUVATA hopes that the authorities understand that unlike businesses trading in new auto parts, traders of used parts need to carry out minor dismantling work in order to obtain said used parts, such as by taking apart a large group of components to acquire smaller, individual parts.\n\nThe association suggests that enforcement agencies have perhaps misunderstood used auto parts as being under the manufacturing sector, and therefore have not allowed essential auto parts businesses to operate, and clarifies that the parts selection processes are purely to the customers\u2019 requirements.\n\n\u201cWe wish to convey that it is crucial for new and used auto parts to go hand-in-hand with workshops, as it is useless for workshops to operate without auto parts, new or used,\u201d the statement from MUVATA read. It adds that the logistics sector, which serves transportation for medicine, food and beverage, is reliant on repairs and servicing, and that disruptions in parts supply may see workshops face major challenges.\n\nAccording to an internal survey held by MUVATA, 20% of its members have stated that they are unable to survive, and would be forced to close down if the lockdown is prolonged. While the auto parts sector is listed as an essential category, its members\u2019 business volume has dropped by nearly 70% in this full movement control order (FMCO), it said.\n\nThe association also asks for the government to allow used auto parts companies with the relevant approval letters to operate with a workforce of 60%, for businesses including wholesale, export and the dismantling and sorting of auto parts, and not just for selling to local workshops. In closing, the MUVATA statement reads that \u201cthe industry welcomes the automatic bank loan moratorium, as well as the extension and enhancement of the wage subsidy programme.\u201d\n\nUpon the FMCO taking effect on June 1, vehicle repair (body and paint) and service centres have been allowed to operate at 60% worker capacity, KPDNHEP minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi said at the time. MUVATA also calls for the acceleration of the mass immunisation programme, including for the auto parts sectors as its members\u2019 personnel are customer-facing and therefore are frontliners, as they have to be physically present to discharge their duties and tasks.\n\nMeanwhile in the area of new vehicles, sales are expected to approach zero for the month of June as showrooms nationwide are closed due to the FMCO, with significant financial impact, reported Berita Harian last week. Based on an average vehicle price of RM70,000, the country\u2019s automotive industry is set to lose around RM3.44 billion in revenue due to the sales slump.", "keyword": ["operate", "used",

If there is any honour left in them, they would have resigned.\n\nThere is no excuse and they cannot expect to be fined like other citizens because they represent the SOPs (standard operating procedures), the MCOs and supported the Emergency and everything that came with it.\n\nWhile most opinions tend to be more forgiving of Mustapa and the brunt reserved for Mohd Rashid, ultimately, the wrongs they committed were of equal proportion.\n\nNo doubt, there had been other leaders from the government who had breached the SOPs. By now, whether they got punished or fined just like other ordinary citizens is no longer the issue.\n\nThe offenders from the government should actually tender their resignations and not pass the burden of rectifying their wrongs to the police or other enforcement bodies.\n\nSuch expectations are actually too highly placed, in fact almost delusionary.\n\nHowever, if Prime Minister (PM) Tan Sri Mahiaddin Md Yassin and other senior leaders in the government are still clueless as to why public disaffection towards them is not just simmering but reaching boiling point, they should be told that they suffer from trust deficit from all aspects of governance and administration.\n\nThe issue of being a backdoor government, not having legitimacy and backstabbing their political friends have taken a backseat and overtaken by their inefficiency, flip-flops, ineptitude, double-standards, shady deals, incompetence, cluelessness and repeat all these many folds.\n\nBecause of their inability to rule and manage the nation, all their past sins are catching up with them.\n\nThen there is the tendency of putting their foot in their mouth \u2014 one example is the quote that he can\u2019t be expected to take care of all 32 million Malaysians.\n\nIt may sound honest, but anyone accepting the top post in the government, especially when no one had put the gun to his or her head, meant that the whole populace, whether they are supporters or doubters or opponents, all and sundry are the leader\u2019s responsibility.\n\nIt is then no surprise that today, as the \u201cwhite flag\u201d campaign gathers momentum, it signifies the loss of confidence in the government to resolve their ails and they would probably by now accept they are the ones that did not make it to the list of citizens that the leader could take care of.\n\nA PAS leader who tried to mock the campaign \u2014 aimed at getting those who are too ashamed to seek assistance to put up the flag to signify their desperation \u2014 was either in denial or being defensive as he is part of the \u201cfailed government\u201d.\n\nRoundly censured, PAS is yet another component of the ruling coalition that adds to the missteps of the government, which even without is already overflowing the brim.\n\nIf opinions and actions are insufficient to add to the woes or being publicly denounced, even a prepared statement from the PM\u2019s Office regarding Mahiaddin\u2019s health did not pass public scrutiny.\n\nIn the first place, it is incomprehensible why his office chose to share the one detail that led to the PM being hospitalised and placed under observation.\n\nBy any standards, no one discussed such conditions publicly as problems of the bowel movements at best would only be shared with doctors or in the days of yore, with the dukun or shaman master, or maybe not given their prowess of insights of knowing even without being told.\n\nInstead of sympathy or at least a short truce until the PM is discharged, the choice of word in the statement went trending and nuanced creatively to mock and undermine the government of the day.

Also, some developers are offering buyers to rent with an option to purchase,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve (TMR).\n\nCCO & Associates (KL) Sdn Bhd ED Chan Wai Seen said the rental for residential properties has undergone adjustments since 2015 and many landlords have been charging low rentals in order to attract tenants.\n\n\u201cGenerally, rental rates for newly completed projects or properties located nearby new projects will continue to be highly competitive. Rental rates may gradually improve when properties located within the new projects have achieved high occupancy rates.\n\n\u201cWith the large number of affordable properties coming into the market, we expect rental will remain at a highly competitive level,\u201d he told TMR.\n\nAreca Capital Sdn Bhd CEO Danny Wong Teck Meng said there are two schools of thought.\n\nFirstly, that the supply glut of residential properties is still hanging thus affecting the rental market; and on the other hand, many working adults now prefer to rent rather than buy properties.\n\nWong is of the opinion that it highly depends on the location, adding that the rental market is still soft for the time being.\n\nAsiacap Valuers & Property Consultants Sdn Bhd property valuer Kit Au Yong surmised the property market to remain in a soft condition in 2H21 going into 1H22, with possibly slow gradual improvement in 2H22.\n\n\u201cWe maintain a cautious view about the property market performance. However, the market is treading carefully in response to the current volatile unprecedented short- to mid-term condition,\u201d he said.\n\nLast year\u2019s pandemic shock immensely hurt Malaysia\u2019s economy with its GDP contracting 5.6%.\n\nThis year, the GDP is projected to recover at about 5%-6%.\n\nIn April, Finance Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz said Malaysia\u2019s property market in 2020 experienced a decrease of 9.9% in volume of transactions and 15.8% in value of transactions compared to 2019.\n\nAccording to Property Market 1Q21 Snapshot, Malaysia recorded 80,694 transactions, a contraction of 11.6% compared to 4Q20.\n\nThe government has introduced the Prihatin Rakyat Economic Stimulus Package and the Short-term Economic Recovery Plan, as well as allocations and incentives to help cushion the negative impact on the property market such as the stamp duty exemption.", "keyword": ["better", "rent", "transactions", "market", "property", "demand", "improve", "remain", "properties", "residential", "rental", "economic"], "summary": "\u201cUnable to commit to a purchase, the only option available for those who require accommodation is to rent, hence the residential market will improve.\nFirstly, that the supply glut of residential properties is still hanging thus affecting the rental market; and on the other hand, many working adults now prefer to rent rather than buy properties.\nWong is of the opinion that it highly depends on the location, adding that the rental market is still soft for the time being.\n\u201cWe maintain a cautious view about the property market performance.\nAccording to Property Market 1Q21 Snapshot, Malaysia recorded 80,694 transactions, a contraction of 11.6% compared to 4Q20.", "news": "The Malaysian Reserve", "date": "2021-07-01 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Opposition can\u2019t make headway without a PM candidate, says analyst", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wNi8yMi9vcHBvc2l0aW9uLWNhbnQtbWFrZS1oZWFkd2F5LXdpdGhvdXQtYS1wbS1jYW5kaWRhdGUtc2F5cy1hbmFseXN0L9IBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Minderjeet Kaur"], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FMT-AHMAD-ZAHID-HAMIDI-02.jpg", "text": "PETALING JAYA: Umno and Pakatan Harapan are not likely to call for a confidence vote against Muhyiddin Yassin unless they have agreed on a candidate to be the new prime minister, and until the Covid-19 crisis is under control, say political analysts.\n\nFormer academic Azmi Hassan said Umno\u2019s two-week ultimatum to Muhyiddin was to force the Perikatan Nasional government to do \u201csomething positive\u201d.\n\nUmno president Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said yesterday he gave the PN-led government 14 days to reconvene Parliament.\n\nAzmi said Umno was using the opportunity to put PN in an awkward position.\n\n\u201cThey know (that a Parliament sitting) is not achievable at least until the end of July but they may feel this is the best way to force PN\u2019s hand,\u201d he told FMT.\n\nHe said it was unlikely that any political party would call for a confidence vote against the prime minister when Parliament sits, as the rakyat may accuse the politicians of putting their self-interest above public health.\n\n\u201cThe health issue needs to be addressed first. After that comes jobs, as many people are jobless,\u201d he added.\n\nHowever, he said Umno and Pakatan Harapan may make life difficult for the governing party by not supporting any bills that are presented. \u201cThat\u2019s where problems may arise.\u201d\n\nThose who intended to push for the confidence vote should have a candidate for a new prime minister ready, in case the present government fails to garner a sufficient majority, he said.\n\nKenneth Cheng, a member of the Agora Society, a loose network of intellectuals, told FMT that Umno will only be able to initiate real changes if elections are called.\n\nHe said that even if the party were to withdraw from the government now, it would need to agree with other parties on a prime ministerial candidate.\n\nLast week, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong issued a statement that Parliament should reconvene as soon as possible. A day earlier, Muhyiddin had said that Parliament could meet by September or October at the earliest and only if daily Covid-19 cases dropped below 2,000.\n\nCheng said not all Umno ministers may withdraw from the government in the midst of the pandemic.\n\nUmno would have a better chance of governing the country after a general election as it is expected to gain ground support from rural and urban Malays, he said.\n\n\u201cUntil then, Umno will have to strategise its moves,\u201d he added.\n\nCheng added that it is unclear if Muhyiddin still holds a majority in the Dewan Rakyat, especially after two Umno MPs said they have withdrawn their support. The two are Kelantan Umno chief and Machang MP Ahmad Jazlan Yaakub, and Padang Rengas MP Nazri Aziz, while Gua Musang MP Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah said he refused to back Muhyiddin as prime minister.\n\nCheng said a few MPs may jump ship to support Muhyiddin\u2019s administration.

A funeral mass began at 10am local time, at the Ateneo de Manila University, Aquino\u2019s alma mater, where his funeral urn had been on view on Friday.\n\nAquino\u2019s passing comes as the political landscape shifts in a country dominated by dynasties.\n\nIn recent years, President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s clan based in the south of the Philippines has been dominant. With Duterte patronage, the family of former president and dictator Ferdinand Marcos \u2013 the nemesis of the Aquinos \u2013 has seen its fortunes revive.\n\nAquino\u2019s sudden death prompted much reflection on his six-year term, which ended in 2016 and saw the economic revival of the so called \u201csick man of Asia\u201d.\n\nPresident Duterte declared 10 days of national mourning and called Aquino\u2019s death \u201can opportunity to unite in prayer and set aside our differences\u201d.\n\nAquino, the country\u2019s 15th president, was inaugurated in June 2010 following a landslide election win delivered on the back of a strong anti-graft campaign.\n\nThe former senator had not been his party\u2019s first choice, but calls for him to run mounted after the death in August 2009 of his mother, Corazon Aquino, a former president. For supporters, an Aquino was the answer to the massive corruption plaguing the country.\n\n\u201cI accept the plea of the nation. I also accept the instructions of my parents. I accept the responsibility to continue the fight for our country,\u201d Aquino said when he declared his candidacy.\n\nThat was just 40 days after his mother\u2019s death, and he was speaking in the same venue where she took her oath of office in 1986. Many regarded it as a moment of history repeating itself.\n\nAquino\u2019s father, Sen Benigno \u201cNinoy\u201d Aquino Jr, was assassinated in 1983 on the tarmac of Manila International Airport \u2013 subsequently renamed in his honour \u2013 as he returned from exile in the US.\n\nThe opposition leader\u2019s callous murder was the catalyst for People Power, the revolutionary movement that brought down the Marcos dictatorship and catapulted Corazon Aquino, a housewife, into the presidency.\n\nAlthough he arrived in office on the coattails of his parents, Aquino went on to create a significant legacy in this own right.\n\nHis sound economic management and image of incorruptibility inspired confidence from investors long spooked by crooked politics, coup attempts and corruption scandals.\n\nOn Aquino\u2019s watch, gross domestic product mushroomed to an average of 6% annually, the largest in 40 years. Annual foreign direct investment rose to US$8.3 billion in 2016 from just US$2 billion before he entered office. The country\u2019s credit ratings all went up.\n\nThe last president also strengthened the old defence alliance with the US In 2013, he challenged China\u2019s expansion claims in the disputed South China Sea.\n\nThe country\u2019s most powerful neighbour lost international arbitration at The Hague in a ruling handed down a week after Aquino left office. China never recognised the court\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cPresident Aquino\u2019s steadfast commitment to advancing peace, upholding the rule of law, and driving economic growth for all Filipinos, while taking bold steps to promote the rules-based international order, leaves a remarkable legacy at home and abroad that will endure for the years to come,\u201d US President Joe Biden said in a statement.\n\nBut for all his international prestige, reducing domestic poverty and social inequality remained stubborn challenges for Aquino. That created an opening for Duterte \u2013 an outsider who advocated strongarm tactics against national problems.\n\nA week before the 2016 elections, Aquino warned voters off Duterte, implying that he had the makings of a dictator.\n\nStill the mayor of Davao City in the southern province of Mindanao broke the Manila hold on politics and won by a landslide with over six million votes more than closest rival Mar Roxas, Aquino\u2019s anointed successor.\n\nDuterte\u2019s presidency has been markedly different on all scores. He embraced China and distanced himself from the US.\n\nHe launched a brutal drugs war that has killed thousands of alleged offenders \u2013 a bloody campaign that while popular at home was heavily condemned abroad. Duterte also cracked down on business elites associated with Aquino to rally support.\n\nSome regarded Aquino as elitist, and Duterte\u2019s ordinary man image appealed to many Filipinos. The president\u2019s popularity has not waned, and his brash politics have eclipsed the Aquino brand.\n\nIn the 2019 mid-term elections, Duterte-allied candidates, including his former aide Bong Go and police chief Ronald Dela Rosa, won most of the 12 seats on the table. Aquino\u2019s cousin, Paolo Benigno \u201cBam\u201d Aquino IV, meanwhile failed to get re-elected.\n\nAlthough Duterte enjoys overwhelming support, Aquino\u2019s death could have some impact on the political scene, analysts believe.\n\nIt has come less than a year ahead of the May 2022 presidential elections. The early frontrunner is Sara Duterte, the president\u2019s daughter and mayor of Davao.\n\nFerdinand Marcos Jr, \u2013 a former senator and the son of the late president, has also emerged as a strong contender in opinion polls. Marcos lost by a slim margin to Aquino-backed Leni Robredo in the 2016 race for vice president.\n\nDuterte loyalists have meanwhile been urging the still hugely popular president to run as vice-president. This would enable him to continue wielding power by skirting a six-year term limit put in place during the presidency of Corazon Aquino.\n\nThe 1986 constitution included a single term provision to try and prevent a repeat of the Marcos dictatorship.\n\nPeter Mumford, a Southeast Asia analyst at Eurasia Group, thinks the passing of Aquino could boost support for his Liberal Party, which has been flagging in the polls.\n\n\u201cHowever, comparisons with Aquino III\u2019s political rise following the deaths of his parents and the current situation need to be made with caution,\u201d Mumford told Nikkei Asia.\n\n\u201cAquino\u2019s parents were even more popular and revered. Plus, in 2010 there was not a highly popular outgoing president able to whip up mass support for their chosen successor \u2013 as is the case with Duterte now.\u201d\n\nBob Herrera-Lim, an analyst at Teneo, an advisory company, said Aquino\u2019s death \u201cwill eventually deprive supporters of Duterte a common target for their populist attacks\u201d and likely \u201clead to a shift in tactics for the administration\u201d.\n\nThe former president\u2019s passing \u201cwill signal an introspection\u201d ahead of the 2022 presidential elections, said Edna Co, a public administration professor at the University of the Philippines.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not whether we are a fan of PNoy or not,\u201d Co said, using the former president\u2019s popular moniker. \u201cIt\u2019s an introspection of what kind of leadership we had and we would like to have in 2022.\u201d\n\nWhile the dynastic shifts will be closely followed, Co said it would be better if next year\u2019s elections focus more on governance than political clans.\n\n\u201cThe Philippines has been trapped in dynastic politics, but this is already the 21st century,\u201d Co said. \u201cThe next election should be about democratic governance, regardless of who brings it \u2013 I don\u2019t care whether it is a Marcos, Aquino or Duterte.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["marcos", "upper", "gives", "aquino", "popular", "presidents",

Malaysia Used Vehicle Autoparts Traders Association (MUVATA) has called upon the government to clarify the position of new and used automotive parts importers, exporters, wholesalers and retailers it represents to be classified under the spare parts sector, the association wrote in an e-mailed statement.\n\nThe association pleads with the ministry of domestic trade and consumer affairs (KPDNHEP) to clarify that businesses dealing in auto parts are under the spare parts sector, which have been allowed to operate, along with car workshops and tyre shops, under FMCO conditions as of June 1.\n\nIt states that most of its members have received approval to operate from the Covid-19 intelligent management system (CIMS) 3.0 under the purview of the ministry of international trade and industry (MITI), having selected peruncitan, pengedaran dan pemborongan (retail, distribution or wholesaling), with the sub-sectors of bengkel, penyelenggaraan dan alat ganti (workshops, maintenance and spare parts).\n\nReports have, however, been received from a few of its members in Johor Bahru, said MUVATA, saying they have been told by the Johor Bahru City Council (MBJB) that they are to shut down immediately as they are deemed not to be categorised under the auto parts sector, and an MBJB officer said that the alat ganti term for permitted businesses is only applicable to those trading in new auto parts, the statement read.\n\nA similar situation was reportedly encountered by the association\u2019s members in Perak, where the police have deemed the businesses\u2019 selected category on the forms to be incorrect, and therefore have also been told to shut down. MUVATA says that used auto parts business operators are now very confused, and some have not dared to remain open for fear of receiving hefty fines, it said, adding that \u201cguidelines need to be clear and consistent, otherwise [it] will burden the industry.\u201d\n\nIn terms of operations, MUVATA hopes that the authorities understand that unlike businesses trading in new auto parts, traders of used parts need to carry out minor dismantling work in order to obtain said used parts, such as by taking apart a large group of components to acquire smaller, individual parts.\n\nThe association suggests that enforcement agencies have perhaps misunderstood used auto parts as being under the manufacturing sector, and therefore have not allowed essential auto parts businesses to operate, and clarifies that the parts selection processes are purely to the customers\u2019 requirements.\n\n\u201cWe wish to convey that it is crucial for new and used auto parts to go hand-in-hand with workshops, as it is useless for workshops to operate without auto parts, new or used,\u201d the statement from MUVATA read. It adds that the logistics sector, which serves transportation for medicine, food and beverage, is reliant on repairs and servicing, and that disruptions in parts supply may see workshops face major challenges.\n\nAccording to an internal survey held by MUVATA, 20% of its members have stated that they are unable to survive, and would be forced to close down if the lockdown is prolonged. While the auto parts sector is listed as an essential category, its members\u2019 business volume has dropped by nearly 70% in this full movement control order (FMCO), it said.\n\nThe association also asks for the government to allow used auto parts companies with the relevant approval letters to operate with a workforce of 60%, for businesses including wholesale, export and the dismantling and sorting of auto parts, and not just for selling to local workshops. In closing, the MUVATA statement reads that \u201cthe industry welcomes the automatic bank loan moratorium, as well as the extension and enhancement of the wage subsidy programme.\u201d\n\nUpon the FMCO taking effect on June 1, vehicle repair (body and paint) and service centres have been allowed to operate at 60% worker capacity, KPDNHEP minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi said at the time. MUVATA also calls for the acceleration of the mass immunisation programme, including for the auto parts sectors as its members\u2019 personnel are customer-facing and therefore are frontliners, as they have to be physically present to discharge their duties and tasks.\n\nMeanwhile in the area of new vehicles, sales are expected to approach zero for the month of June as showrooms nationwide are closed due to the FMCO, with significant financial impact, reported Berita Harian last week. Based on an average vehicle price of RM70,000, the country\u2019s automotive industry is set to lose around RM3.44 billion in revenue due to the sales slump.", "keyword": ["operate", "used",

If there is any honour left in them, they would have resigned.\n\nThere is no excuse and they cannot expect to be fined like other citizens because they represent the SOPs (standard operating procedures), the MCOs and supported the Emergency and everything that came with it.\n\nWhile most opinions tend to be more forgiving of Mustapa and the brunt reserved for Mohd Rashid, ultimately, the wrongs they committed were of equal proportion.\n\nNo doubt, there had been other leaders from the government who had breached the SOPs. By now, whether they got punished or fined just like other ordinary citizens is no longer the issue.\n\nThe offenders from the government should actually tender their resignations and not pass the burden of rectifying their wrongs to the police or other enforcement bodies.\n\nSuch expectations are actually too highly placed, in fact almost delusionary.\n\nHowever, if Prime Minister (PM) Tan Sri Mahiaddin Md Yassin and other senior leaders in the government are still clueless as to why public disaffection towards them is not just simmering but reaching boiling point, they should be told that they suffer from trust deficit from all aspects of governance and administration.\n\nThe issue of being a backdoor government, not having legitimacy and backstabbing their political friends have taken a backseat and overtaken by their inefficiency, flip-flops, ineptitude, double-standards, shady deals, incompetence, cluelessness and repeat all these many folds.\n\nBecause of their inability to rule and manage the nation, all their past sins are catching up with them.\n\nThen there is the tendency of putting their foot in their mouth \u2014 one example is the quote that he can\u2019t be expected to take care of all 32 million Malaysians.\n\nIt may sound honest, but anyone accepting the top post in the government, especially when no one had put the gun to his or her head, meant that the whole populace, whether they are supporters or doubters or opponents, all and sundry are the leader\u2019s responsibility.\n\nIt is then no surprise that today, as the \u201cwhite flag\u201d campaign gathers momentum, it signifies the loss of confidence in the government to resolve their ails and they would probably by now accept they are the ones that did not make it to the list of citizens that the leader could take care of.\n\nA PAS leader who tried to mock the campaign \u2014 aimed at getting those who are too ashamed to seek assistance to put up the flag to signify their desperation \u2014 was either in denial or being defensive as he is part of the \u201cfailed government\u201d.\n\nRoundly censured, PAS is yet another component of the ruling coalition that adds to the missteps of the government, which even without is already overflowing the brim.\n\nIf opinions and actions are insufficient to add to the woes or being publicly denounced, even a prepared statement from the PM\u2019s Office regarding Mahiaddin\u2019s health did not pass public scrutiny.\n\nIn the first place, it is incomprehensible why his office chose to share the one detail that led to the PM being hospitalised and placed under observation.\n\nBy any standards, no one discussed such conditions publicly as problems of the bowel movements at best would only be shared with doctors or in the days of yore, with the dukun or shaman master, or maybe not given their prowess of insights of knowing even without being told.\n\nInstead of sympathy or at least a short truce until the PM is discharged, the choice of word in the statement went trending and nuanced creatively to mock and undermine the government of the day.

Also, some developers are offering buyers to rent with an option to purchase,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve (TMR).\n\nCCO & Associates (KL) Sdn Bhd ED Chan Wai Seen said the rental for residential properties has undergone adjustments since 2015 and many landlords have been charging low rentals in order to attract tenants.\n\n\u201cGenerally, rental rates for newly completed projects or properties located nearby new projects will continue to be highly competitive. Rental rates may gradually improve when properties located within the new projects have achieved high occupancy rates.\n\n\u201cWith the large number of affordable properties coming into the market, we expect rental will remain at a highly competitive level,\u201d he told TMR.\n\nAreca Capital Sdn Bhd CEO Danny Wong Teck Meng said there are two schools of thought.\n\nFirstly, that the supply glut of residential properties is still hanging thus affecting the rental market; and on the other hand, many working adults now prefer to rent rather than buy properties.\n\nWong is of the opinion that it highly depends on the location, adding that the rental market is still soft for the time being.\n\nAsiacap Valuers & Property Consultants Sdn Bhd property valuer Kit Au Yong surmised the property market to remain in a soft condition in 2H21 going into 1H22, with possibly slow gradual improvement in 2H22.\n\n\u201cWe maintain a cautious view about the property market performance. However, the market is treading carefully in response to the current volatile unprecedented short- to mid-term condition,\u201d he said.\n\nLast year\u2019s pandemic shock immensely hurt Malaysia\u2019s economy with its GDP contracting 5.6%.\n\nThis year, the GDP is projected to recover at about 5%-6%.\n\nIn April, Finance Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz said Malaysia\u2019s property market in 2020 experienced a decrease of 9.9% in volume of transactions and 15.8% in value of transactions compared to 2019.\n\nAccording to Property Market 1Q21 Snapshot, Malaysia recorded 80,694 transactions, a contraction of 11.6% compared to 4Q20.\n\nThe government has introduced the Prihatin Rakyat Economic Stimulus Package and the Short-term Economic Recovery Plan, as well as allocations and incentives to help cushion the negative impact on the property market such as the stamp duty exemption.", "keyword": ["better", "rent", "transactions", "market", "property", "demand", "improve", "remain", "properties", "residential", "rental", "economic"], "summary": "\u201cUnable to commit to a purchase, the only option available for those who require accommodation is to rent, hence the residential market will improve.\nFirstly, that the supply glut of residential properties is still hanging thus affecting the rental market; and on the other hand, many working adults now prefer to rent rather than buy properties.\nWong is of the opinion that it highly depends on the location, adding that the rental market is still soft for the time being.\n\u201cWe maintain a cautious view about the property market performance.\nAccording to Property Market 1Q21 Snapshot, Malaysia recorded 80,694 transactions, a contraction of 11.6% compared to 4Q20.", "news": "The Malaysian Reserve", "date": "2021-07-01 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Opposition can\u2019t make headway without a PM candidate, says analyst", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wNi8yMi9vcHBvc2l0aW9uLWNhbnQtbWFrZS1oZWFkd2F5LXdpdGhvdXQtYS1wbS1jYW5kaWRhdGUtc2F5cy1hbmFseXN0L9IBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Minderjeet Kaur"], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FMT-AHMAD-ZAHID-HAMIDI-02.jpg", "text": "PETALING JAYA: Umno and Pakatan Harapan are not likely to call for a confidence vote against Muhyiddin Yassin unless they have agreed on a candidate to be the new prime minister, and until the Covid-19 crisis is under control, say political analysts.\n\nFormer academic Azmi Hassan said Umno\u2019s two-week ultimatum to Muhyiddin was to force the Perikatan Nasional government to do \u201csomething positive\u201d.\n\nUmno president Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said yesterday he gave the PN-led government 14 days to reconvene Parliament.\n\nAzmi said Umno was using the opportunity to put PN in an awkward position.\n\n\u201cThey know (that a Parliament sitting) is not achievable at least until the end of July but they may feel this is the best way to force PN\u2019s hand,\u201d he told FMT.\n\nHe said it was unlikely that any political party would call for a confidence vote against the prime minister when Parliament sits, as the rakyat may accuse the politicians of putting their self-interest above public health.\n\n\u201cThe health issue needs to be addressed first. After that comes jobs, as many people are jobless,\u201d he added.\n\nHowever, he said Umno and Pakatan Harapan may make life difficult for the governing party by not supporting any bills that are presented. \u201cThat\u2019s where problems may arise.\u201d\n\nThose who intended to push for the confidence vote should have a candidate for a new prime minister ready, in case the present government fails to garner a sufficient majority, he said.\n\nKenneth Cheng, a member of the Agora Society, a loose network of intellectuals, told FMT that Umno will only be able to initiate real changes if elections are called.\n\nHe said that even if the party were to withdraw from the government now, it would need to agree with other parties on a prime ministerial candidate.\n\nLast week, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong issued a statement that Parliament should reconvene as soon as possible. A day earlier, Muhyiddin had said that Parliament could meet by September or October at the earliest and only if daily Covid-19 cases dropped below 2,000.\n\nCheng said not all Umno ministers may withdraw from the government in the midst of the pandemic.\n\nUmno would have a better chance of governing the country after a general election as it is expected to gain ground support from rural and urban Malays, he said.\n\n\u201cUntil then, Umno will have to strategise its moves,\u201d he added.\n\nCheng added that it is unclear if Muhyiddin still holds a majority in the Dewan Rakyat, especially after two Umno MPs said they have withdrawn their support. The two are Kelantan Umno chief and Machang MP Ahmad Jazlan Yaakub, and Padang Rengas MP Nazri Aziz, while Gua Musang MP Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah said he refused to back Muhyiddin as prime minister.\n\nCheng said a few MPs may jump ship to support Muhyiddin\u2019s administration.

A funeral mass began at 10am local time, at the Ateneo de Manila University, Aquino\u2019s alma mater, where his funeral urn had been on view on Friday.\n\nAquino\u2019s passing comes as the political landscape shifts in a country dominated by dynasties.\n\nIn recent years, President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s clan based in the south of the Philippines has been dominant. With Duterte patronage, the family of former president and dictator Ferdinand Marcos \u2013 the nemesis of the Aquinos \u2013 has seen its fortunes revive.\n\nAquino\u2019s sudden death prompted much reflection on his six-year term, which ended in 2016 and saw the economic revival of the so called \u201csick man of Asia\u201d.\n\nPresident Duterte declared 10 days of national mourning and called Aquino\u2019s death \u201can opportunity to unite in prayer and set aside our differences\u201d.\n\nAquino, the country\u2019s 15th president, was inaugurated in June 2010 following a landslide election win delivered on the back of a strong anti-graft campaign.\n\nThe former senator had not been his party\u2019s first choice, but calls for him to run mounted after the death in August 2009 of his mother, Corazon Aquino, a former president. For supporters, an Aquino was the answer to the massive corruption plaguing the country.\n\n\u201cI accept the plea of the nation. I also accept the instructions of my parents. I accept the responsibility to continue the fight for our country,\u201d Aquino said when he declared his candidacy.\n\nThat was just 40 days after his mother\u2019s death, and he was speaking in the same venue where she took her oath of office in 1986. Many regarded it as a moment of history repeating itself.\n\nAquino\u2019s father, Sen Benigno \u201cNinoy\u201d Aquino Jr, was assassinated in 1983 on the tarmac of Manila International Airport \u2013 subsequently renamed in his honour \u2013 as he returned from exile in the US.\n\nThe opposition leader\u2019s callous murder was the catalyst for People Power, the revolutionary movement that brought down the Marcos dictatorship and catapulted Corazon Aquino, a housewife, into the presidency.\n\nAlthough he arrived in office on the coattails of his parents, Aquino went on to create a significant legacy in this own right.\n\nHis sound economic management and image of incorruptibility inspired confidence from investors long spooked by crooked politics, coup attempts and corruption scandals.\n\nOn Aquino\u2019s watch, gross domestic product mushroomed to an average of 6% annually, the largest in 40 years. Annual foreign direct investment rose to US$8.3 billion in 2016 from just US$2 billion before he entered office. The country\u2019s credit ratings all went up.\n\nThe last president also strengthened the old defence alliance with the US In 2013, he challenged China\u2019s expansion claims in the disputed South China Sea.\n\nThe country\u2019s most powerful neighbour lost international arbitration at The Hague in a ruling handed down a week after Aquino left office. China never recognised the court\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cPresident Aquino\u2019s steadfast commitment to advancing peace, upholding the rule of law, and driving economic growth for all Filipinos, while taking bold steps to promote the rules-based international order, leaves a remarkable legacy at home and abroad that will endure for the years to come,\u201d US President Joe Biden said in a statement.\n\nBut for all his international prestige, reducing domestic poverty and social inequality remained stubborn challenges for Aquino. That created an opening for Duterte \u2013 an outsider who advocated strongarm tactics against national problems.\n\nA week before the 2016 elections, Aquino warned voters off Duterte, implying that he had the makings of a dictator.\n\nStill the mayor of Davao City in the southern province of Mindanao broke the Manila hold on politics and won by a landslide with over six million votes more than closest rival Mar Roxas, Aquino\u2019s anointed successor.\n\nDuterte\u2019s presidency has been markedly different on all scores. He embraced China and distanced himself from the US.\n\nHe launched a brutal drugs war that has killed thousands of alleged offenders \u2013 a bloody campaign that while popular at home was heavily condemned abroad. Duterte also cracked down on business elites associated with Aquino to rally support.\n\nSome regarded Aquino as elitist, and Duterte\u2019s ordinary man image appealed to many Filipinos. The president\u2019s popularity has not waned, and his brash politics have eclipsed the Aquino brand.\n\nIn the 2019 mid-term elections, Duterte-allied candidates, including his former aide Bong Go and police chief Ronald Dela Rosa, won most of the 12 seats on the table. Aquino\u2019s cousin, Paolo Benigno \u201cBam\u201d Aquino IV, meanwhile failed to get re-elected.\n\nAlthough Duterte enjoys overwhelming support, Aquino\u2019s death could have some impact on the political scene, analysts believe.\n\nIt has come less than a year ahead of the May 2022 presidential elections. The early frontrunner is Sara Duterte, the president\u2019s daughter and mayor of Davao.\n\nFerdinand Marcos Jr, \u2013 a former senator and the son of the late president, has also emerged as a strong contender in opinion polls. Marcos lost by a slim margin to Aquino-backed Leni Robredo in the 2016 race for vice president.\n\nDuterte loyalists have meanwhile been urging the still hugely popular president to run as vice-president. This would enable him to continue wielding power by skirting a six-year term limit put in place during the presidency of Corazon Aquino.\n\nThe 1986 constitution included a single term provision to try and prevent a repeat of the Marcos dictatorship.\n\nPeter Mumford, a Southeast Asia analyst at Eurasia Group, thinks the passing of Aquino could boost support for his Liberal Party, which has been flagging in the polls.\n\n\u201cHowever, comparisons with Aquino III\u2019s political rise following the deaths of his parents and the current situation need to be made with caution,\u201d Mumford told Nikkei Asia.\n\n\u201cAquino\u2019s parents were even more popular and revered. Plus, in 2010 there was not a highly popular outgoing president able to whip up mass support for their chosen successor \u2013 as is the case with Duterte now.\u201d\n\nBob Herrera-Lim, an analyst at Teneo, an advisory company, said Aquino\u2019s death \u201cwill eventually deprive supporters of Duterte a common target for their populist attacks\u201d and likely \u201clead to a shift in tactics for the administration\u201d.\n\nThe former president\u2019s passing \u201cwill signal an introspection\u201d ahead of the 2022 presidential elections, said Edna Co, a public administration professor at the University of the Philippines.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not whether we are a fan of PNoy or not,\u201d Co said, using the former president\u2019s popular moniker. \u201cIt\u2019s an introspection of what kind of leadership we had and we would like to have in 2022.\u201d\n\nWhile the dynastic shifts will be closely followed, Co said it would be better if next year\u2019s elections focus more on governance than political clans.\n\n\u201cThe Philippines has been trapped in dynastic politics, but this is already the 21st century,\u201d Co said. \u201cThe next election should be about democratic governance, regardless of who brings it \u2013 I don\u2019t care whether it is a Marcos, Aquino or Duterte.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["marcos", "upper", "gives", "aquino", "popular", "presidents",

Malaysia Used Vehicle Autoparts Traders Association (MUVATA) has called upon the government to clarify the position of new and used automotive parts importers, exporters, wholesalers and retailers it represents to be classified under the spare parts sector, the association wrote in an e-mailed statement.\n\nThe association pleads with the ministry of domestic trade and consumer affairs (KPDNHEP) to clarify that businesses dealing in auto parts are under the spare parts sector, which have been allowed to operate, along with car workshops and tyre shops, under FMCO conditions as of June 1.\n\nIt states that most of its members have received approval to operate from the Covid-19 intelligent management system (CIMS) 3.0 under the purview of the ministry of international trade and industry (MITI), having selected peruncitan, pengedaran dan pemborongan (retail, distribution or wholesaling), with the sub-sectors of bengkel, penyelenggaraan dan alat ganti (workshops, maintenance and spare parts).\n\nReports have, however, been received from a few of its members in Johor Bahru, said MUVATA, saying they have been told by the Johor Bahru City Council (MBJB) that they are to shut down immediately as they are deemed not to be categorised under the auto parts sector, and an MBJB officer said that the alat ganti term for permitted businesses is only applicable to those trading in new auto parts, the statement read.\n\nA similar situation was reportedly encountered by the association\u2019s members in Perak, where the police have deemed the businesses\u2019 selected category on the forms to be incorrect, and therefore have also been told to shut down. MUVATA says that used auto parts business operators are now very confused, and some have not dared to remain open for fear of receiving hefty fines, it said, adding that \u201cguidelines need to be clear and consistent, otherwise [it] will burden the industry.\u201d\n\nIn terms of operations, MUVATA hopes that the authorities understand that unlike businesses trading in new auto parts, traders of used parts need to carry out minor dismantling work in order to obtain said used parts, such as by taking apart a large group of components to acquire smaller, individual parts.\n\nThe association suggests that enforcement agencies have perhaps misunderstood used auto parts as being under the manufacturing sector, and therefore have not allowed essential auto parts businesses to operate, and clarifies that the parts selection processes are purely to the customers\u2019 requirements.\n\n\u201cWe wish to convey that it is crucial for new and used auto parts to go hand-in-hand with workshops, as it is useless for workshops to operate without auto parts, new or used,\u201d the statement from MUVATA read. It adds that the logistics sector, which serves transportation for medicine, food and beverage, is reliant on repairs and servicing, and that disruptions in parts supply may see workshops face major challenges.\n\nAccording to an internal survey held by MUVATA, 20% of its members have stated that they are unable to survive, and would be forced to close down if the lockdown is prolonged. While the auto parts sector is listed as an essential category, its members\u2019 business volume has dropped by nearly 70% in this full movement control order (FMCO), it said.\n\nThe association also asks for the government to allow used auto parts companies with the relevant approval letters to operate with a workforce of 60%, for businesses including wholesale, export and the dismantling and sorting of auto parts, and not just for selling to local workshops. In closing, the MUVATA statement reads that \u201cthe industry welcomes the automatic bank loan moratorium, as well as the extension and enhancement of the wage subsidy programme.\u201d\n\nUpon the FMCO taking effect on June 1, vehicle repair (body and paint) and service centres have been allowed to operate at 60% worker capacity, KPDNHEP minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi said at the time. MUVATA also calls for the acceleration of the mass immunisation programme, including for the auto parts sectors as its members\u2019 personnel are customer-facing and therefore are frontliners, as they have to be physically present to discharge their duties and tasks.\n\nMeanwhile in the area of new vehicles, sales are expected to approach zero for the month of June as showrooms nationwide are closed due to the FMCO, with significant financial impact, reported Berita Harian last week. Based on an average vehicle price of RM70,000, the country\u2019s automotive industry is set to lose around RM3.44 billion in revenue due to the sales slump.", "keyword": ["operate", "used",

If there is any honour left in them, they would have resigned.\n\nThere is no excuse and they cannot expect to be fined like other citizens because they represent the SOPs (standard operating procedures), the MCOs and supported the Emergency and everything that came with it.\n\nWhile most opinions tend to be more forgiving of Mustapa and the brunt reserved for Mohd Rashid, ultimately, the wrongs they committed were of equal proportion.\n\nNo doubt, there had been other leaders from the government who had breached the SOPs. By now, whether they got punished or fined just like other ordinary citizens is no longer the issue.\n\nThe offenders from the government should actually tender their resignations and not pass the burden of rectifying their wrongs to the police or other enforcement bodies.\n\nSuch expectations are actually too highly placed, in fact almost delusionary.\n\nHowever, if Prime Minister (PM) Tan Sri Mahiaddin Md Yassin and other senior leaders in the government are still clueless as to why public disaffection towards them is not just simmering but reaching boiling point, they should be told that they suffer from trust deficit from all aspects of governance and administration.\n\nThe issue of being a backdoor government, not having legitimacy and backstabbing their political friends have taken a backseat and overtaken by their inefficiency, flip-flops, ineptitude, double-standards, shady deals, incompetence, cluelessness and repeat all these many folds.\n\nBecause of their inability to rule and manage the nation, all their past sins are catching up with them.\n\nThen there is the tendency of putting their foot in their mouth \u2014 one example is the quote that he can\u2019t be expected to take care of all 32 million Malaysians.\n\nIt may sound honest, but anyone accepting the top post in the government, especially when no one had put the gun to his or her head, meant that the whole populace, whether they are supporters or doubters or opponents, all and sundry are the leader\u2019s responsibility.\n\nIt is then no surprise that today, as the \u201cwhite flag\u201d campaign gathers momentum, it signifies the loss of confidence in the government to resolve their ails and they would probably by now accept they are the ones that did not make it to the list of citizens that the leader could take care of.\n\nA PAS leader who tried to mock the campaign \u2014 aimed at getting those who are too ashamed to seek assistance to put up the flag to signify their desperation \u2014 was either in denial or being defensive as he is part of the \u201cfailed government\u201d.\n\nRoundly censured, PAS is yet another component of the ruling coalition that adds to the missteps of the government, which even without is already overflowing the brim.\n\nIf opinions and actions are insufficient to add to the woes or being publicly denounced, even a prepared statement from the PM\u2019s Office regarding Mahiaddin\u2019s health did not pass public scrutiny.\n\nIn the first place, it is incomprehensible why his office chose to share the one detail that led to the PM being hospitalised and placed under observation.\n\nBy any standards, no one discussed such conditions publicly as problems of the bowel movements at best would only be shared with doctors or in the days of yore, with the dukun or shaman master, or maybe not given their prowess of insights of knowing even without being told.\n\nInstead of sympathy or at least a short truce until the PM is discharged, the choice of word in the statement went trending and nuanced creatively to mock and undermine the government of the day. While it can be dismissed as petty, any discerning and sensitive leader would know that the government has totally lost both the plot and public confidence.\n\nAnd they can only salvage some redemption by exiting.", "keyword": ["sops", "goodwill", "leaders", "statement", "rashid", "issue", "left", "spare", "nary", "wrongs", "citizens", "leader", "public"], "summary": "While most opinions tend to be more forgiving of Mustapa and the brunt reserved for Mohd Rashid, ultimately, the wrongs they committed were of equal proportion.\nNo doubt, there had been other leaders from the government who had breached the SOPs.\nBy now, whether they got punished or fined just like other ordinary citizens is no longer the issue.\nBecause of their inability to rule and manage the nation, all their past sins are catching up with them.\nWhile it can be dismissed as petty, any discerning and sensitive leader would know that the government has totally lost both the plot and public confidence.", "news": "The Malaysian Reserve", "date": "2021-07-02 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Absorb all contract doctors into govt service, says DAP", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wNi8yNy9hYnNvcmItYWxsLWNvbnRyYWN0LWRvY3RvcnMtaW50by1nb3Z0LXNlcnZpY2Utc2F5cy1kYXAv0gEA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Fmt Reporters"], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hospital-staff-doctor-nurse-bernama-101020.jpg", "text": "PETALING JAYA: The government must devise a long-term financial plan to absorb all the 23,000 contract doctors into the government service as soon as possible because they will be needed to fight the Covid-19 pandemic on a long-term basis, says DAP.\n\nParty secretary-general Lim Guan Eng said the government should not even think of race and religion when offering the position to these junior doctors, as requested by an NGO which urged the health ministry to ensure all Bumiputera medical officers were absorbed into the health service.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, DAP supports the Malaysian Medical Association\u2019s concerns about a government proposal placing new medical graduates on a permanent basis, which appears to discriminate against non-Bumiputeras.\n\n\u201cTo win the battle against Covid-19, a whole-of society effort is required that needs to mobilise all trained health workers, regardless of race, religion or socio-economic background,\u201d he said in a statement today.\n\nYesterday, the MMA criticised a proposal for Putrajaya to ensure that new medical officers, especially from among the Bumiputeras, would be placed in permanent posts.\n\nMMA president Dr Subramaniam Muniandy said racial or religious prejudices should not influence the selection of officers or whether they should serve in permanent positions.\n\nHe said Malaysia needed the best and brightest individuals to serve the people, adding that talent should not distinguish between ethnicity, religion, creed or gender.\n\nLim, the Bagan MP, said since the Perikatan Nasional government had admitted that Covid-19 is endemic and would not go away even after herd immunity is achieved, the country needed more doctors, nurses and trained health workers.\n\n\u201cAn extra RM4 billion will enable all to be employed.

Also, some developers are offering buyers to rent with an option to purchase,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve (TMR).\n\nCCO & Associates (KL) Sdn Bhd ED Chan Wai Seen said the rental for residential properties has undergone adjustments since 2015 and many landlords have been charging low rentals in order to attract tenants.\n\n\u201cGenerally, rental rates for newly completed projects or properties located nearby new projects will continue to be highly competitive. Rental rates may gradually improve when properties located within the new projects have achieved high occupancy rates.\n\n\u201cWith the large number of affordable properties coming into the market, we expect rental will remain at a highly competitive level,\u201d he told TMR.\n\nAreca Capital Sdn Bhd CEO Danny Wong Teck Meng said there are two schools of thought.\n\nFirstly, that the supply glut of residential properties is still hanging thus affecting the rental market; and on the other hand, many working adults now prefer to rent rather than buy properties.\n\nWong is of the opinion that it highly depends on the location, adding that the rental market is still soft for the time being.\n\nAsiacap Valuers & Property Consultants Sdn Bhd property valuer Kit Au Yong surmised the property market to remain in a soft condition in 2H21 going into 1H22, with possibly slow gradual improvement in 2H22.\n\n\u201cWe maintain a cautious view about the property market performance.

A day earlier, Muhyiddin had said that Parliament could meet by September or October at the earliest and only if daily Covid-19 cases dropped below 2,000.\n\nCheng said not all Umno ministers may withdraw from the government in the midst of the pandemic.\n\nUmno would have a better chance of governing the country after a general election as it is expected to gain ground support from rural and urban Malays, he said.\n\n\u201cUntil then, Umno will have to strategise its moves,\u201d he added.\n\nCheng added that it is unclear if Muhyiddin still holds a majority in the Dewan Rakyat, especially after two Umno MPs said they have withdrawn their support. The two are Kelantan Umno chief and Machang MP Ahmad Jazlan Yaakub, and Padang Rengas MP Nazri Aziz, while Gua Musang MP Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah said he refused to back Muhyiddin as prime minister.\n\nCheng said a few MPs may jump ship to support Muhyiddin\u2019s administration.

A funeral mass began at 10am local time, at the Ateneo de Manila University, Aquino\u2019s alma mater, where his funeral urn had been on view on Friday.\n\nAquino\u2019s passing comes as the political landscape shifts in a country dominated by dynasties.\n\nIn recent years, President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s clan based in the south of the Philippines has been dominant. With Duterte patronage, the family of former president and dictator Ferdinand Marcos \u2013 the nemesis of the Aquinos \u2013 has seen its fortunes revive.\n\nAquino\u2019s sudden death prompted much reflection on his six-year term, which ended in 2016 and saw the economic revival of the so called \u201csick man of Asia\u201d.\n\nPresident Duterte declared 10 days of national mourning and called Aquino\u2019s death \u201can opportunity to unite in prayer and set aside our differences\u201d.\n\nAquino, the country\u2019s 15th president, was inaugurated in June 2010 following a landslide election win delivered on the back of a strong anti-graft campaign.\n\nThe former senator had not been his party\u2019s first choice, but calls for him to run mounted after the death in August 2009 of his mother, Corazon Aquino, a former president. For supporters, an Aquino was the answer to the massive corruption plaguing the country.\n\n\u201cI accept the plea of the nation. I also accept the instructions of my parents. I accept the responsibility to continue the fight for our country,\u201d Aquino said when he declared his candidacy.\n\nThat was just 40 days after his mother\u2019s death, and he was speaking in the same venue where she took her oath of office in 1986. Many regarded it as a moment of history repeating itself.\n\nAquino\u2019s father, Sen Benigno \u201cNinoy\u201d Aquino Jr, was assassinated in 1983 on the tarmac of Manila International Airport \u2013 subsequently renamed in his honour \u2013 as he returned from exile in the US.\n\nThe opposition leader\u2019s callous murder was the catalyst for People Power, the revolutionary movement that brought down the Marcos dictatorship and catapulted Corazon Aquino, a housewife, into the presidency.\n\nAlthough he arrived in office on the coattails of his parents, Aquino went on to create a significant legacy in this own right.\n\nHis sound economic management and image of incorruptibility inspired confidence from investors long spooked by crooked politics, coup attempts and corruption scandals.\n\nOn Aquino\u2019s watch, gross domestic product mushroomed to an average of 6% annually, the largest in 40 years. Annual foreign direct investment rose to US$8.3 billion in 2016 from just US$2 billion before he entered office. The country\u2019s credit ratings all went up.\n\nThe last president also strengthened the old defence alliance with the US In 2013, he challenged China\u2019s expansion claims in the disputed South China Sea.\n\nThe country\u2019s most powerful neighbour lost international arbitration at The Hague in a ruling handed down a week after Aquino left office. China never recognised the court\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cPresident Aquino\u2019s steadfast commitment to advancing peace, upholding the rule of law, and driving economic growth for all Filipinos, while taking bold steps to promote the rules-based international order, leaves a remarkable legacy at home and abroad that will endure for the years to come,\u201d US President Joe Biden said in a statement.\n\nBut for all his international prestige, reducing domestic poverty and social inequality remained stubborn challenges for Aquino. That created an opening for Duterte \u2013 an outsider who advocated strongarm tactics against national problems.\n\nA week before the 2016 elections, Aquino warned voters off Duterte, implying that he had the makings of a dictator.\n\nStill the mayor of Davao City in the southern province of Mindanao broke the Manila hold on politics and won by a landslide with over six million votes more than closest rival Mar Roxas, Aquino\u2019s anointed successor.\n\nDuterte\u2019s presidency has been markedly different on all scores. He embraced China and distanced himself from the US.\n\nHe launched a brutal drugs war that has killed thousands of alleged offenders \u2013 a bloody campaign that while popular at home was heavily condemned abroad. Duterte also cracked down on business elites associated with Aquino to rally support.\n\nSome regarded Aquino as elitist, and Duterte\u2019s ordinary man image appealed to many Filipinos. The president\u2019s popularity has not waned, and his brash politics have eclipsed the Aquino brand.\n\nIn the 2019 mid-term elections, Duterte-allied candidates, including his former aide Bong Go and police chief Ronald Dela Rosa, won most of the 12 seats on the table. Aquino\u2019s cousin, Paolo Benigno \u201cBam\u201d Aquino IV, meanwhile failed to get re-elected.\n\nAlthough Duterte enjoys overwhelming support, Aquino\u2019s death could have some impact on the political scene, analysts believe.\n\nIt has come less than a year ahead of the May 2022 presidential elections. The early frontrunner is Sara Duterte, the president\u2019s daughter and mayor of Davao.\n\nFerdinand Marcos Jr, \u2013 a former senator and the son of the late president, has also emerged as a strong contender in opinion polls. Marcos lost by a slim margin to Aquino-backed Leni Robredo in the 2016 race for vice president.\n\nDuterte loyalists have meanwhile been urging the still hugely popular president to run as vice-president. This would enable him to continue wielding power by skirting a six-year term limit put in place during the presidency of Corazon Aquino.\n\nThe 1986 constitution included a single term provision to try and prevent a repeat of the Marcos dictatorship.\n\nPeter Mumford, a Southeast Asia analyst at Eurasia Group, thinks the passing of Aquino could boost support for his Liberal Party, which has been flagging in the polls.\n\n\u201cHowever, comparisons with Aquino III\u2019s political rise following the deaths of his parents and the current situation need to be made with caution,\u201d Mumford told Nikkei Asia.\n\n\u201cAquino\u2019s parents were even more popular and revered. Plus, in 2010 there was not a highly popular outgoing president able to whip up mass support for their chosen successor \u2013 as is the case with Duterte now.\u201d\n\nBob Herrera-Lim, an analyst at Teneo, an advisory company, said Aquino\u2019s death \u201cwill eventually deprive supporters of Duterte a common target for their populist attacks\u201d and likely \u201clead to a shift in tactics for the administration\u201d.\n\nThe former president\u2019s passing \u201cwill signal an introspection\u201d ahead of the 2022 presidential elections, said Edna Co, a public administration professor at the University of the Philippines.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not whether we are a fan of PNoy or not,\u201d Co said, using the former president\u2019s popular moniker. \u201cIt\u2019s an introspection of what kind of leadership we had and we would like to have in 2022.\u201d\n\nWhile the dynastic shifts will be closely followed, Co said it would be better if next year\u2019s elections focus more on governance than political clans.\n\n\u201cThe Philippines has been trapped in dynastic politics, but this is already the 21st century,\u201d Co said. \u201cThe next election should be about democratic governance, regardless of who brings it \u2013 I don\u2019t care whether it is a Marcos, Aquino or Duterte.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["marcos", "upper", "gives", "aquino", "popular", "presidents",

Malaysia Used Vehicle Autoparts Traders Association (MUVATA) has called upon the government to clarify the position of new and used automotive parts importers, exporters, wholesalers and retailers it represents to be classified under the spare parts sector, the association wrote in an e-mailed statement.\n\nThe association pleads with the ministry of domestic trade and consumer affairs (KPDNHEP) to clarify that businesses dealing in auto parts are under the spare parts sector, which have been allowed to operate, along with car workshops and tyre shops, under FMCO conditions as of June 1.\n\nIt states that most of its members have received approval to operate from the Covid-19 intelligent management system (CIMS) 3.0 under the purview of the ministry of international trade and industry (MITI), having selected peruncitan, pengedaran dan pemborongan (retail, distribution or wholesaling), with the sub-sectors of bengkel, penyelenggaraan dan alat ganti (workshops, maintenance and spare parts).\n\nReports have, however, been received from a few of its members in Johor Bahru, said MUVATA, saying they have been told by the Johor Bahru City Council (MBJB) that they are to shut down immediately as they are deemed not to be categorised under the auto parts sector, and an MBJB officer said that the alat ganti term for permitted businesses is only applicable to those trading in new auto parts, the statement read.\n\nA similar situation was reportedly encountered by the association\u2019s members in Perak, where the police have deemed the businesses\u2019 selected category on the forms to be incorrect, and therefore have also been told to shut down. MUVATA says that used auto parts business operators are now very confused, and some have not dared to remain open for fear of receiving hefty fines, it said, adding that \u201cguidelines need to be clear and consistent, otherwise [it] will burden the industry.\u201d\n\nIn terms of operations, MUVATA hopes that the authorities understand that unlike businesses trading in new auto parts, traders of used parts need to carry out minor dismantling work in order to obtain said used parts, such as by taking apart a large group of components to acquire smaller, individual parts.\n\nThe association suggests that enforcement agencies have perhaps misunderstood used auto parts as being under the manufacturing sector, and therefore have not allowed essential auto parts businesses to operate, and clarifies that the parts selection processes are purely to the customers\u2019 requirements.\n\n\u201cWe wish to convey that it is crucial for new and used auto parts to go hand-in-hand with workshops, as it is useless for workshops to operate without auto parts, new or used,\u201d the statement from MUVATA read. It adds that the logistics sector, which serves transportation for medicine, food and beverage, is reliant on repairs and servicing, and that disruptions in parts supply may see workshops face major challenges.\n\nAccording to an internal survey held by MUVATA, 20% of its members have stated that they are unable to survive, and would be forced to close down if the lockdown is prolonged. While the auto parts sector is listed as an essential category, its members\u2019 business volume has dropped by nearly 70% in this full movement control order (FMCO), it said.\n\nThe association also asks for the government to allow used auto parts companies with the relevant approval letters to operate with a workforce of 60%, for businesses including wholesale, export and the dismantling and sorting of auto parts, and not just for selling to local workshops. In closing, the MUVATA statement reads that \u201cthe industry welcomes the automatic bank loan moratorium, as well as the extension and enhancement of the wage subsidy programme.\u201d\n\nUpon the FMCO taking effect on June 1, vehicle repair (body and paint) and service centres have been allowed to operate at 60% worker capacity, KPDNHEP minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi said at the time. MUVATA also calls for the acceleration of the mass immunisation programme, including for the auto parts sectors as its members\u2019 personnel are customer-facing and therefore are frontliners, as they have to be physically present to discharge their duties and tasks.\n\nMeanwhile in the area of new vehicles, sales are expected to approach zero for the month of June as showrooms nationwide are closed due to the FMCO, with significant financial impact, reported Berita Harian last week. Based on an average vehicle price of RM70,000, the country\u2019s automotive industry is set to lose around RM3.44 billion in revenue due to the sales slump.", "keyword": ["operate", "used",

order prior to this.\n\nReferring to the National People's Well-Being and Economic Recovery Package (Pemulih), he said that the aid package was balanced and coincided with the current situation and could assure that the country would win in fight against Covid-19 for the well-being and survival of the people.\n\n\u201cKPDNHEP truly appreciates the concern of the government which is committed to alleviating the cost of living of the people by continuing the policy of controlling the prices of essential items, among others maintaining the retail prices of petrol RON95, diesel and LPG involving subsidies of over RM6 billion a year,\u201d he said in a statement, today.\n\nAccording to Nanta, the ministry recorded its appreciation to the government for accepting the unsubsidised cooking oil price management mechanism proposal to tackle the issue of cooking oil price hike in one kilogramme (kg) to five kg bottles.\n\nTowards this end, KPDNHEP would co-operate with the relevant ministries in implementing the price control based on the Crude Palm Oil (CPO) threshold value and ensure the price of a five kg bottle of cooking oil would not exceed RM30.\n\nThe ministry also lauded an additional allocation of RM1 billion to ensure the supply of subsidised cooking oil in one kg polybags is guaranteed and is available at a subsidised price of RM2.50.\n\nIn addition, the ministry fully supported the Small Entrepreneur Digitalisation Empowering Programme (Pupuk) with an allocation of RM200 million for micro, small and medium enterprises (PMKS) and RM100 million for small and medium enterprises to boost the national digitalisation agenda.\n\nKPDNHEP too had for a long time mobilised the digitalisation programme either at the ministerial level or in the distribution trade sector through various applications such as ez-Aduan, Price Catcher, My Sales Tracker, MyHarga, Spacedeal, Chatbot Sara and ReDI.\n\nNanta said the ministry has started a special immunisation programme for economic frontliners so that the country could move towards the opening up of more economic sectors when all involved have undergone full immunisation. \u2015 Bernama", "keyword":

If there is any honour left in them, they would have resigned.\n\nThere is no excuse and they cannot expect to be fined like other citizens because they represent the SOPs (standard operating procedures), the MCOs and supported the Emergency and everything that came with it.\n\nWhile most opinions tend to be more forgiving of Mustapa and the brunt reserved for Mohd Rashid, ultimately, the wrongs they committed were of equal proportion.\n\nNo doubt, there had been other leaders from the government who had breached the SOPs. By now, whether they got punished or fined just like other ordinary citizens is no longer the issue.\n\nThe offenders from the government should actually tender their resignations and not pass the burden of rectifying their wrongs to the police or other enforcement bodies.\n\nSuch expectations are actually too highly placed, in fact almost delusionary.\n\nHowever, if Prime Minister (PM) Tan Sri Mahiaddin Md Yassin and other senior leaders in the government are still clueless as to why public disaffection towards them is not just simmering but reaching boiling point, they should be told that they suffer from trust deficit from all aspects of governance and administration.\n\nThe issue of being a backdoor government, not having legitimacy and backstabbing their political friends have taken a backseat and overtaken by their inefficiency, flip-flops, ineptitude, double-standards, shady deals, incompetence, cluelessness and repeat all these many folds.\n\nBecause of their inability to rule and manage the nation, all their past sins are catching up with them.\n\nThen there is the tendency of putting their foot in their mouth \u2014 one example is the quote that he can\u2019t be expected to take care of all 32 million Malaysians.\n\nIt may sound honest, but anyone accepting the top post in the government, especially when no one had put the gun to his or her head, meant that the whole populace, whether they are supporters or doubters or opponents, all and sundry are the leader\u2019s responsibility.\n\nIt is then no surprise that today, as the \u201cwhite flag\u201d campaign gathers momentum, it signifies the loss of confidence in the government to resolve their ails and they would probably by now accept they are the ones that did not make it to the list of citizens that the leader could take care of.\n\nA PAS leader who tried to mock the campaign \u2014 aimed at getting those who are too ashamed to seek assistance to put up the flag to signify their desperation \u2014 was either in denial or being defensive as he is part of the \u201cfailed government\u201d.\n\nRoundly censured, PAS is yet another component of the ruling coalition that adds to the missteps of the government, which even without is already overflowing the brim.\n\nIf opinions and actions are insufficient to add to the woes or being publicly denounced, even a prepared statement from the PM\u2019s Office regarding Mahiaddin\u2019s health did not pass public scrutiny.\n\nIn the first place, it is incomprehensible why his office chose to share the one detail that led to the PM being hospitalised and placed under observation.\n\nBy any standards, no one discussed such conditions publicly as problems of the bowel movements at best would only be shared with doctors or in the days of yore, with the dukun or shaman master, or maybe not given their prowess of insights of knowing even without being told.\n\nInstead of sympathy or at least a short truce until the PM is discharged, the choice of word in the statement went trending and nuanced creatively to mock and undermine the government of the day. While it can be dismissed as petty, any discerning and sensitive leader would know that the government has totally lost both the plot and public confidence.\n\nAnd they can only salvage some redemption by exiting.", "keyword": ["sops", "goodwill", "leaders", "statement", "rashid", "issue", "left", "spare", "nary", "wrongs", "citizens", "leader", "public"], "summary": "While most opinions tend to be more forgiving of Mustapa and the brunt reserved for Mohd Rashid, ultimately, the wrongs they committed were of equal proportion.\nNo doubt, there had been other leaders from the government who had breached the SOPs.\nBy now, whether they got punished or fined just like other ordinary citizens is no longer the issue.\nBecause of their inability to rule and manage the nation, all their past sins are catching up with them.\nWhile it can be dismissed as petty, any discerning and sensitive leader would know that the government has totally lost both the plot and public confidence.", "news": "The Malaysian Reserve", "date": "2021-07-02 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Absorb all contract doctors into govt service, says DAP", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wNi8yNy9hYnNvcmItYWxsLWNvbnRyYWN0LWRvY3RvcnMtaW50by1nb3Z0LXNlcnZpY2Utc2F5cy1kYXAv0gEA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Fmt Reporters"], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hospital-staff-doctor-nurse-bernama-101020.jpg", "text": "PETALING JAYA: The government must devise a long-term financial plan to absorb all the 23,000 contract doctors into the government service as soon as possible because they will be needed to fight the Covid-19 pandemic on a long-term basis, says DAP.\n\nParty secretary-general Lim Guan Eng said the government should not even think of race and religion when offering the position to these junior doctors, as requested by an NGO which urged the health ministry to ensure all Bumiputera medical officers were absorbed into the health service.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, DAP supports the Malaysian Medical Association\u2019s concerns about a government proposal placing new medical graduates on a permanent basis, which appears to discriminate against non-Bumiputeras.\n\n\u201cTo win the battle against Covid-19, a whole-of society effort is required that needs to mobilise all trained health workers, regardless of race, religion or socio-economic background,\u201d he said in a statement today.\n\nYesterday, the MMA criticised a proposal for Putrajaya to ensure that new medical officers, especially from among the Bumiputeras, would be placed in permanent posts.\n\nMMA president Dr Subramaniam Muniandy said racial or religious prejudices should not influence the selection of officers or whether they should serve in permanent positions.\n\nHe said Malaysia needed the best and brightest individuals to serve the people, adding that talent should not distinguish between ethnicity, religion, creed or gender.\n\nLim, the Bagan MP, said since the Perikatan Nasional government had admitted that Covid-19 is endemic and would not go away even after herd immunity is achieved, the country needed more doctors, nurses and trained health workers.\n\n\u201cAn extra RM4 billion will enable all to be employed.

Also, some developers are offering buyers to rent with an option to purchase,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve (TMR).\n\nCCO & Associates (KL) Sdn Bhd ED Chan Wai Seen said the rental for residential properties has undergone adjustments since 2015 and many landlords have been charging low rentals in order to attract tenants.\n\n\u201cGenerally, rental rates for newly completed projects or properties located nearby new projects will continue to be highly competitive. Rental rates may gradually improve when properties located within the new projects have achieved high occupancy rates.\n\n\u201cWith the large number of affordable properties coming into the market, we expect rental will remain at a highly competitive level,\u201d he told TMR.\n\nAreca Capital Sdn Bhd CEO Danny Wong Teck Meng said there are two schools of thought.\n\nFirstly, that the supply glut of residential properties is still hanging thus affecting the rental market; and on the other hand, many working adults now prefer to rent rather than buy properties.\n\nWong is of the opinion that it highly depends on the location, adding that the rental market is still soft for the time being.\n\nAsiacap Valuers & Property Consultants Sdn Bhd property valuer Kit Au Yong surmised the property market to remain in a soft condition in 2H21 going into 1H22, with possibly slow gradual improvement in 2H22.\n\n\u201cWe maintain a cautious view about the property market performance.

A day earlier, Muhyiddin had said that Parliament could meet by September or October at the earliest and only if daily Covid-19 cases dropped below 2,000.\n\nCheng said not all Umno ministers may withdraw from the government in the midst of the pandemic.\n\nUmno would have a better chance of governing the country after a general election as it is expected to gain ground support from rural and urban Malays, he said.\n\n\u201cUntil then, Umno will have to strategise its moves,\u201d he added.\n\nCheng added that it is unclear if Muhyiddin still holds a majority in the Dewan Rakyat, especially after two Umno MPs said they have withdrawn their support. The two are Kelantan Umno chief and Machang MP Ahmad Jazlan Yaakub, and Padang Rengas MP Nazri Aziz, while Gua Musang MP Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah said he refused to back Muhyiddin as prime minister.\n\nCheng said a few MPs may jump ship to support Muhyiddin\u2019s administration.

A funeral mass began at 10am local time, at the Ateneo de Manila University, Aquino\u2019s alma mater, where his funeral urn had been on view on Friday.\n\nAquino\u2019s passing comes as the political landscape shifts in a country dominated by dynasties.\n\nIn recent years, President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s clan based in the south of the Philippines has been dominant. With Duterte patronage, the family of former president and dictator Ferdinand Marcos \u2013 the nemesis of the Aquinos \u2013 has seen its fortunes revive.\n\nAquino\u2019s sudden death prompted much reflection on his six-year term, which ended in 2016 and saw the economic revival of the so called \u201csick man of Asia\u201d.\n\nPresident Duterte declared 10 days of national mourning and called Aquino\u2019s death \u201can opportunity to unite in prayer and set aside our differences\u201d.\n\nAquino, the country\u2019s 15th president, was inaugurated in June 2010 following a landslide election win delivered on the back of a strong anti-graft campaign.\n\nThe former senator had not been his party\u2019s first choice, but calls for him to run mounted after the death in August 2009 of his mother, Corazon Aquino, a former president. For supporters, an Aquino was the answer to the massive corruption plaguing the country.\n\n\u201cI accept the plea of the nation. I also accept the instructions of my parents. I accept the responsibility to continue the fight for our country,\u201d Aquino said when he declared his candidacy.\n\nThat was just 40 days after his mother\u2019s death, and he was speaking in the same venue where she took her oath of office in 1986. Many regarded it as a moment of history repeating itself.\n\nAquino\u2019s father, Sen Benigno \u201cNinoy\u201d Aquino Jr, was assassinated in 1983 on the tarmac of Manila International Airport \u2013 subsequently renamed in his honour \u2013 as he returned from exile in the US.\n\nThe opposition leader\u2019s callous murder was the catalyst for People Power, the revolutionary movement that brought down the Marcos dictatorship and catapulted Corazon Aquino, a housewife, into the presidency.\n\nAlthough he arrived in office on the coattails of his parents, Aquino went on to create a significant legacy in this own right.\n\nHis sound economic management and image of incorruptibility inspired confidence from investors long spooked by crooked politics, coup attempts and corruption scandals.\n\nOn Aquino\u2019s watch, gross domestic product mushroomed to an average of 6% annually, the largest in 40 years. Annual foreign direct investment rose to US$8.3 billion in 2016 from just US$2 billion before he entered office. The country\u2019s credit ratings all went up.\n\nThe last president also strengthened the old defence alliance with the US In 2013, he challenged China\u2019s expansion claims in the disputed South China Sea.\n\nThe country\u2019s most powerful neighbour lost international arbitration at The Hague in a ruling handed down a week after Aquino left office. China never recognised the court\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cPresident Aquino\u2019s steadfast commitment to advancing peace, upholding the rule of law, and driving economic growth for all Filipinos, while taking bold steps to promote the rules-based international order, leaves a remarkable legacy at home and abroad that will endure for the years to come,\u201d US President Joe Biden said in a statement.\n\nBut for all his international prestige, reducing domestic poverty and social inequality remained stubborn challenges for Aquino. That created an opening for Duterte \u2013 an outsider who advocated strongarm tactics against national problems.\n\nA week before the 2016 elections, Aquino warned voters off Duterte, implying that he had the makings of a dictator.\n\nStill the mayor of Davao City in the southern province of Mindanao broke the Manila hold on politics and won by a landslide with over six million votes more than closest rival Mar Roxas, Aquino\u2019s anointed successor.\n\nDuterte\u2019s presidency has been markedly different on all scores. He embraced China and distanced himself from the US.\n\nHe launched a brutal drugs war that has killed thousands of alleged offenders \u2013 a bloody campaign that while popular at home was heavily condemned abroad. Duterte also cracked down on business elites associated with Aquino to rally support.\n\nSome regarded Aquino as elitist, and Duterte\u2019s ordinary man image appealed to many Filipinos. The president\u2019s popularity has not waned, and his brash politics have eclipsed the Aquino brand.\n\nIn the 2019 mid-term elections, Duterte-allied candidates, including his former aide Bong Go and police chief Ronald Dela Rosa, won most of the 12 seats on the table. Aquino\u2019s cousin, Paolo Benigno \u201cBam\u201d Aquino IV, meanwhile failed to get re-elected.\n\nAlthough Duterte enjoys overwhelming support, Aquino\u2019s death could have some impact on the political scene, analysts believe.\n\nIt has come less than a year ahead of the May 2022 presidential elections. The early frontrunner is Sara Duterte, the president\u2019s daughter and mayor of Davao.\n\nFerdinand Marcos Jr, \u2013 a former senator and the son of the late president, has also emerged as a strong contender in opinion polls. Marcos lost by a slim margin to Aquino-backed Leni Robredo in the 2016 race for vice president.\n\nDuterte loyalists have meanwhile been urging the still hugely popular president to run as vice-president. This would enable him to continue wielding power by skirting a six-year term limit put in place during the presidency of Corazon Aquino.\n\nThe 1986 constitution included a single term provision to try and prevent a repeat of the Marcos dictatorship.\n\nPeter Mumford, a Southeast Asia analyst at Eurasia Group, thinks the passing of Aquino could boost support for his Liberal Party, which has been flagging in the polls.\n\n\u201cHowever, comparisons with Aquino III\u2019s political rise following the deaths of his parents and the current situation need to be made with caution,\u201d Mumford told Nikkei Asia.\n\n\u201cAquino\u2019s parents were even more popular and revered. Plus, in 2010 there was not a highly popular outgoing president able to whip up mass support for their chosen successor \u2013 as is the case with Duterte now.\u201d\n\nBob Herrera-Lim, an analyst at Teneo, an advisory company, said Aquino\u2019s death \u201cwill eventually deprive supporters of Duterte a common target for their populist attacks\u201d and likely \u201clead to a shift in tactics for the administration\u201d.\n\nThe former president\u2019s passing \u201cwill signal an introspection\u201d ahead of the 2022 presidential elections, said Edna Co, a public administration professor at the University of the Philippines.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not whether we are a fan of PNoy or not,\u201d Co said, using the former president\u2019s popular moniker. \u201cIt\u2019s an introspection of what kind of leadership we had and we would like to have in 2022.\u201d\n\nWhile the dynastic shifts will be closely followed, Co said it would be better if next year\u2019s elections focus more on governance than political clans.\n\n\u201cThe Philippines has been trapped in dynastic politics, but this is already the 21st century,\u201d Co said. \u201cThe next election should be about democratic governance, regardless of who brings it \u2013 I don\u2019t care whether it is a Marcos, Aquino or Duterte.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["marcos", "upper", "gives", "aquino", "popular", "presidents",

Malaysia Used Vehicle Autoparts Traders Association (MUVATA) has called upon the government to clarify the position of new and used automotive parts importers, exporters, wholesalers and retailers it represents to be classified under the spare parts sector, the association wrote in an e-mailed statement.\n\nThe association pleads with the ministry of domestic trade and consumer affairs (KPDNHEP) to clarify that businesses dealing in auto parts are under the spare parts sector, which have been allowed to operate, along with car workshops and tyre shops, under FMCO conditions as of June 1.\n\nIt states that most of its members have received approval to operate from the Covid-19 intelligent management system (CIMS) 3.0 under the purview of the ministry of international trade and industry (MITI), having selected peruncitan, pengedaran dan pemborongan (retail, distribution or wholesaling), with the sub-sectors of bengkel, penyelenggaraan dan alat ganti (workshops, maintenance and spare parts).\n\nReports have, however, been received from a few of its members in Johor Bahru, said MUVATA, saying they have been told by the Johor Bahru City Council (MBJB) that they are to shut down immediately as they are deemed not to be categorised under the auto parts sector, and an MBJB officer said that the alat ganti term for permitted businesses is only applicable to those trading in new auto parts, the statement read.\n\nA similar situation was reportedly encountered by the association\u2019s members in Perak, where the police have deemed the businesses\u2019 selected category on the forms to be incorrect, and therefore have also been told to shut down. MUVATA says that used auto parts business operators are now very confused, and some have not dared to remain open for fear of receiving hefty fines, it said, adding that \u201cguidelines need to be clear and consistent, otherwise [it] will burden the industry.\u201d\n\nIn terms of operations, MUVATA hopes that the authorities understand that unlike businesses trading in new auto parts, traders of used parts need to carry out minor dismantling work in order to obtain said used parts, such as by taking apart a large group of components to acquire smaller, individual parts.\n\nThe association suggests that enforcement agencies have perhaps misunderstood used auto parts as being under the manufacturing sector, and therefore have not allowed essential auto parts businesses to operate, and clarifies that the parts selection processes are purely to the customers\u2019 requirements.\n\n\u201cWe wish to convey that it is crucial for new and used auto parts to go hand-in-hand with workshops, as it is useless for workshops to operate without auto parts, new or used,\u201d the statement from MUVATA read. It adds that the logistics sector, which serves transportation for medicine, food and beverage, is reliant on repairs and servicing, and that disruptions in parts supply may see workshops face major challenges.\n\nAccording to an internal survey held by MUVATA, 20% of its members have stated that they are unable to survive, and would be forced to close down if the lockdown is prolonged. While the auto parts sector is listed as an essential category, its members\u2019 business volume has dropped by nearly 70% in this full movement control order (FMCO), it said.\n\nThe association also asks for the government to allow used auto parts companies with the relevant approval letters to operate with a workforce of 60%, for businesses including wholesale, export and the dismantling and sorting of auto parts, and not just for selling to local workshops. In closing, the MUVATA statement reads that \u201cthe industry welcomes the automatic bank loan moratorium, as well as the extension and enhancement of the wage subsidy programme.\u201d\n\nUpon the FMCO taking effect on June 1, vehicle repair (body and paint) and service centres have been allowed to operate at 60% worker capacity, KPDNHEP minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi said at the time. MUVATA also calls for the acceleration of the mass immunisation programme, including for the auto parts sectors as its members\u2019 personnel are customer-facing and therefore are frontliners, as they have to be physically present to discharge their duties and tasks.\n\nMeanwhile in the area of new vehicles, sales are expected to approach zero for the month of June as showrooms nationwide are closed due to the FMCO, with significant financial impact, reported Berita Harian last week. Based on an average vehicle price of RM70,000, the country\u2019s automotive industry is set to lose around RM3.44 billion in revenue due to the sales slump.", "keyword": ["operate", "used",

order prior to this.\n\nReferring to the National People's Well-Being and Economic Recovery Package (Pemulih), he said that the aid package was balanced and coincided with the current situation and could assure that the country would win in fight against Covid-19 for the well-being and survival of the people.\n\n\u201cKPDNHEP truly appreciates the concern of the government which is committed to alleviating the cost of living of the people by continuing the policy of controlling the prices of essential items, among others maintaining the retail prices of petrol RON95, diesel and LPG involving subsidies of over RM6 billion a year,\u201d he said in a statement, today.\n\nAccording to Nanta, the ministry recorded its appreciation to the government for accepting the unsubsidised cooking oil price management mechanism proposal to tackle the issue of cooking oil price hike in one kilogramme (kg) to five kg bottles.\n\nTowards this end, KPDNHEP would co-operate with the relevant ministries in implementing the price control based on the Crude Palm Oil (CPO) threshold value and ensure the price of a five kg bottle of cooking oil would not exceed RM30.\n\nThe ministry also lauded an additional allocation of RM1 billion to ensure the supply of subsidised cooking oil in one kg polybags is guaranteed and is available at a subsidised price of RM2.50.\n\nIn addition, the ministry fully supported the Small Entrepreneur Digitalisation Empowering Programme (Pupuk) with an allocation of RM200 million for micro, small and medium enterprises (PMKS) and RM100 million for small and medium enterprises to boost the national digitalisation agenda.\n\nKPDNHEP too had for a long time mobilised the digitalisation programme either at the ministerial level or in the distribution trade sector through various applications such as ez-Aduan, Price Catcher, My Sales Tracker, MyHarga, Spacedeal, Chatbot Sara and ReDI.\n\nNanta said the ministry has started a special immunisation programme for economic frontliners so that the country could move towards the opening up of more economic sectors when all involved have undergone full immunisation. \u2015 Bernama", "keyword":

If there is any honour left in them, they would have resigned.\n\nThere is no excuse and they cannot expect to be fined like other citizens because they represent the SOPs (standard operating procedures), the MCOs and supported the Emergency and everything that came with it.\n\nWhile most opinions tend to be more forgiving of Mustapa and the brunt reserved for Mohd Rashid, ultimately, the wrongs they committed were of equal proportion.\n\nNo doubt, there had been other leaders from the government who had breached the SOPs. By now, whether they got punished or fined just like other ordinary citizens is no longer the issue.\n\nThe offenders from the government should actually tender their resignations and not pass the burden of rectifying their wrongs to the police or other enforcement bodies.\n\nSuch expectations are actually too highly placed, in fact almost delusionary.\n\nHowever, if Prime Minister (PM) Tan Sri Mahiaddin Md Yassin and other senior leaders in the government are still clueless as to why public disaffection towards them is not just simmering but reaching boiling point, they should be told that they suffer from trust deficit from all aspects of governance and administration.\n\nThe issue of being a backdoor government, not having legitimacy and backstabbing their political friends have taken a backseat and overtaken by their inefficiency, flip-flops, ineptitude, double-standards, shady deals, incompetence, cluelessness and repeat all these many folds.\n\nBecause of their inability to rule and manage the nation, all their past sins are catching up with them.\n\nThen there is the tendency of putting their foot in their mouth \u2014 one example is the quote that he can\u2019t be expected to take care of all 32 million Malaysians.\n\nIt may sound honest, but anyone accepting the top post in the government, especially when no one had put the gun to his or her head, meant that the whole populace, whether they are supporters or doubters or opponents, all and sundry are the leader\u2019s responsibility.\n\nIt is then no surprise that today, as the \u201cwhite flag\u201d campaign gathers momentum, it signifies the loss of confidence in the government to resolve their ails and they would probably by now accept they are the ones that did not make it to the list of citizens that the leader could take care of.\n\nA PAS leader who tried to mock the campaign \u2014 aimed at getting those who are too ashamed to seek assistance to put up the flag to signify their desperation \u2014 was either in denial or being defensive as he is part of the \u201cfailed government\u201d.\n\nRoundly censured, PAS is yet another component of the ruling coalition that adds to the missteps of the government, which even without is already overflowing the brim.\n\nIf opinions and actions are insufficient to add to the woes or being publicly denounced, even a prepared statement from the PM\u2019s Office regarding Mahiaddin\u2019s health did not pass public scrutiny.\n\nIn the first place, it is incomprehensible why his office chose to share the one detail that led to the PM being hospitalised and placed under observation.\n\nBy any standards, no one discussed such conditions publicly as problems of the bowel movements at best would only be shared with doctors or in the days of yore, with the dukun or shaman master, or maybe not given their prowess of insights of knowing even without being told.\n\nInstead of sympathy or at least a short truce until the PM is discharged, the choice of word in the statement went trending and nuanced creatively to mock and undermine the government of the day. While it can be dismissed as petty, any discerning and sensitive leader would know that the government has totally lost both the plot and public confidence.\n\nAnd they can only salvage some redemption by exiting.", "keyword": ["sops", "goodwill", "leaders", "statement", "rashid", "issue", "left", "spare", "nary", "wrongs", "citizens", "leader", "public"], "summary": "While most opinions tend to be more forgiving of Mustapa and the brunt reserved for Mohd Rashid, ultimately, the wrongs they committed were of equal proportion.\nNo doubt, there had been other leaders from the government who had breached the SOPs.\nBy now, whether they got punished or fined just like other ordinary citizens is no longer the issue.\nBecause of their inability to rule and manage the nation, all their past sins are catching up with them.\nWhile it can be dismissed as petty, any discerning and sensitive leader would know that the government has totally lost both the plot and public confidence.", "news": "The Malaysian Reserve", "date": "2021-07-02 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Absorb all contract doctors into govt service, says DAP", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wNi8yNy9hYnNvcmItYWxsLWNvbnRyYWN0LWRvY3RvcnMtaW50by1nb3Z0LXNlcnZpY2Utc2F5cy1kYXAv0gEA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Fmt Reporters"], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hospital-staff-doctor-nurse-bernama-101020.jpg", "text": "PETALING JAYA: The government must devise a long-term financial plan to absorb all the 23,000 contract doctors into the government service as soon as possible because they will be needed to fight the Covid-19 pandemic on a long-term basis, says DAP.\n\nParty secretary-general Lim Guan Eng said the government should not even think of race and religion when offering the position to these junior doctors, as requested by an NGO which urged the health ministry to ensure all Bumiputera medical officers were absorbed into the health service.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, DAP supports the Malaysian Medical Association\u2019s concerns about a government proposal placing new medical graduates on a permanent basis, which appears to discriminate against non-Bumiputeras.\n\n\u201cTo win the battle against Covid-19, a whole-of society effort is required that needs to mobilise all trained health workers, regardless of race, religion or socio-economic background,\u201d he said in a statement today.\n\nYesterday, the MMA criticised a proposal for Putrajaya to ensure that new medical officers, especially from among the Bumiputeras, would be placed in permanent posts.\n\nMMA president Dr Subramaniam Muniandy said racial or religious prejudices should not influence the selection of officers or whether they should serve in permanent positions.\n\nHe said Malaysia needed the best and brightest individuals to serve the people, adding that talent should not distinguish between ethnicity, religion, creed or gender.\n\nLim, the Bagan MP, said since the Perikatan Nasional government had admitted that Covid-19 is endemic and would not go away even after herd immunity is achieved, the country needed more doctors, nurses and trained health workers.\n\n\u201cAn extra RM4 billion will enable all to be employed.

A day earlier, Muhyiddin had said that Parliament could meet by September or October at the earliest and only if daily Covid-19 cases dropped below 2,000.\n\nCheng said not all Umno ministers may withdraw from the government in the midst of the pandemic.\n\nUmno would have a better chance of governing the country after a general election as it is expected to gain ground support from rural and urban Malays, he said.\n\n\u201cUntil then, Umno will have to strategise its moves,\u201d he added.\n\nCheng added that it is unclear if Muhyiddin still holds a majority in the Dewan Rakyat, especially after two Umno MPs said they have withdrawn their support. The two are Kelantan Umno chief and Machang MP Ahmad Jazlan Yaakub, and Padang Rengas MP Nazri Aziz, while Gua Musang MP Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah said he refused to back Muhyiddin as prime minister.\n\nCheng said a few MPs may jump ship to support Muhyiddin\u2019s administration.

A funeral mass began at 10am local time, at the Ateneo de Manila University, Aquino\u2019s alma mater, where his funeral urn had been on view on Friday.\n\nAquino\u2019s passing comes as the political landscape shifts in a country dominated by dynasties.\n\nIn recent years, President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s clan based in the south of the Philippines has been dominant. With Duterte patronage, the family of former president and dictator Ferdinand Marcos \u2013 the nemesis of the Aquinos \u2013 has seen its fortunes revive.\n\nAquino\u2019s sudden death prompted much reflection on his six-year term, which ended in 2016 and saw the economic revival of the so called \u201csick man of Asia\u201d.\n\nPresident Duterte declared 10 days of national mourning and called Aquino\u2019s death \u201can opportunity to unite in prayer and set aside our differences\u201d.\n\nAquino, the country\u2019s 15th president, was inaugurated in June 2010 following a landslide election win delivered on the back of a strong anti-graft campaign.\n\nThe former senator had not been his party\u2019s first choice, but calls for him to run mounted after the death in August 2009 of his mother, Corazon Aquino, a former president. For supporters, an Aquino was the answer to the massive corruption plaguing the country.\n\n\u201cI accept the plea of the nation. I also accept the instructions of my parents. I accept the responsibility to continue the fight for our country,\u201d Aquino said when he declared his candidacy.\n\nThat was just 40 days after his mother\u2019s death, and he was speaking in the same venue where she took her oath of office in 1986. Many regarded it as a moment of history repeating itself.\n\nAquino\u2019s father, Sen Benigno \u201cNinoy\u201d Aquino Jr, was assassinated in 1983 on the tarmac of Manila International Airport \u2013 subsequently renamed in his honour \u2013 as he returned from exile in the US.\n\nThe opposition leader\u2019s callous murder was the catalyst for People Power, the revolutionary movement that brought down the Marcos dictatorship and catapulted Corazon Aquino, a housewife, into the presidency.\n\nAlthough he arrived in office on the coattails of his parents, Aquino went on to create a significant legacy in this own right.\n\nHis sound economic management and image of incorruptibility inspired confidence from investors long spooked by crooked politics, coup attempts and corruption scandals.\n\nOn Aquino\u2019s watch, gross domestic product mushroomed to an average of 6% annually, the largest in 40 years. Annual foreign direct investment rose to US$8.3 billion in 2016 from just US$2 billion before he entered office. The country\u2019s credit ratings all went up.\n\nThe last president also strengthened the old defence alliance with the US In 2013, he challenged China\u2019s expansion claims in the disputed South China Sea.\n\nThe country\u2019s most powerful neighbour lost international arbitration at The Hague in a ruling handed down a week after Aquino left office. China never recognised the court\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cPresident Aquino\u2019s steadfast commitment to advancing peace, upholding the rule of law, and driving economic growth for all Filipinos, while taking bold steps to promote the rules-based international order, leaves a remarkable legacy at home and abroad that will endure for the years to come,\u201d US President Joe Biden said in a statement.\n\nBut for all his international prestige, reducing domestic poverty and social inequality remained stubborn challenges for Aquino. That created an opening for Duterte \u2013 an outsider who advocated strongarm tactics against national problems.\n\nA week before the 2016 elections, Aquino warned voters off Duterte, implying that he had the makings of a dictator.\n\nStill the mayor of Davao City in the southern province of Mindanao broke the Manila hold on politics and won by a landslide with over six million votes more than closest rival Mar Roxas, Aquino\u2019s anointed successor.\n\nDuterte\u2019s presidency has been markedly different on all scores. He embraced China and distanced himself from the US.\n\nHe launched a brutal drugs war that has killed thousands of alleged offenders \u2013 a bloody campaign that while popular at home was heavily condemned abroad. Duterte also cracked down on business elites associated with Aquino to rally support.\n\nSome regarded Aquino as elitist, and Duterte\u2019s ordinary man image appealed to many Filipinos. The president\u2019s popularity has not waned, and his brash politics have eclipsed the Aquino brand.\n\nIn the 2019 mid-term elections, Duterte-allied candidates, including his former aide Bong Go and police chief Ronald Dela Rosa, won most of the 12 seats on the table. Aquino\u2019s cousin, Paolo Benigno \u201cBam\u201d Aquino IV, meanwhile failed to get re-elected.\n\nAlthough Duterte enjoys overwhelming support, Aquino\u2019s death could have some impact on the political scene, analysts believe.\n\nIt has come less than a year ahead of the May 2022 presidential elections. The early frontrunner is Sara Duterte, the president\u2019s daughter and mayor of Davao.\n\nFerdinand Marcos Jr, \u2013 a former senator and the son of the late president, has also emerged as a strong contender in opinion polls. Marcos lost by a slim margin to Aquino-backed Leni Robredo in the 2016 race for vice president.\n\nDuterte loyalists have meanwhile been urging the still hugely popular president to run as vice-president. This would enable him to continue wielding power by skirting a six-year term limit put in place during the presidency of Corazon Aquino.\n\nThe 1986 constitution included a single term provision to try and prevent a repeat of the Marcos dictatorship.\n\nPeter Mumford, a Southeast Asia analyst at Eurasia Group, thinks the passing of Aquino could boost support for his Liberal Party, which has been flagging in the polls.\n\n\u201cHowever, comparisons with Aquino III\u2019s political rise following the deaths of his parents and the current situation need to be made with caution,\u201d Mumford told Nikkei Asia.\n\n\u201cAquino\u2019s parents were even more popular and revered. Plus, in 2010 there was not a highly popular outgoing president able to whip up mass support for their chosen successor \u2013 as is the case with Duterte now.\u201d\n\nBob Herrera-Lim, an analyst at Teneo, an advisory company, said Aquino\u2019s death \u201cwill eventually deprive supporters of Duterte a common target for their populist attacks\u201d and likely \u201clead to a shift in tactics for the administration\u201d.\n\nThe former president\u2019s passing \u201cwill signal an introspection\u201d ahead of the 2022 presidential elections, said Edna Co, a public administration professor at the University of the Philippines.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not whether we are a fan of PNoy or not,\u201d Co said, using the former president\u2019s popular moniker. \u201cIt\u2019s an introspection of what kind of leadership we had and we would like to have in 2022.\u201d\n\nWhile the dynastic shifts will be closely followed, Co said it would be better if next year\u2019s elections focus more on governance than political clans.\n\n\u201cThe Philippines has been trapped in dynastic politics, but this is already the 21st century,\u201d Co said. \u201cThe next election should be about democratic governance, regardless of who brings it \u2013 I don\u2019t care whether it is a Marcos, Aquino or Duterte.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["marcos", "upper", "gives", "aquino", "popular", "presidents",

Malaysia Used Vehicle Autoparts Traders Association (MUVATA) has called upon the government to clarify the position of new and used automotive parts importers, exporters, wholesalers and retailers it represents to be classified under the spare parts sector, the association wrote in an e-mailed statement.\n\nThe association pleads with the ministry of domestic trade and consumer affairs (KPDNHEP) to clarify that businesses dealing in auto parts are under the spare parts sector, which have been allowed to operate, along with car workshops and tyre shops, under FMCO conditions as of June 1.\n\nIt states that most of its members have received approval to operate from the Covid-19 intelligent management system (CIMS) 3.0 under the purview of the ministry of international trade and industry (MITI), having selected peruncitan, pengedaran dan pemborongan (retail, distribution or wholesaling), with the sub-sectors of bengkel, penyelenggaraan dan alat ganti (workshops, maintenance and spare parts).\n\nReports have, however, been received from a few of its members in Johor Bahru, said MUVATA, saying they have been told by the Johor Bahru City Council (MBJB) that they are to shut down immediately as they are deemed not to be categorised under the auto parts sector, and an MBJB officer said that the alat ganti term for permitted businesses is only applicable to those trading in new auto parts, the statement read.\n\nA similar situation was reportedly encountered by the association\u2019s members in Perak, where the police have deemed the businesses\u2019 selected category on the forms to be incorrect, and therefore have also been told to shut down. MUVATA says that used auto parts business operators are now very confused, and some have not dared to remain open for fear of receiving hefty fines, it said, adding that \u201cguidelines need to be clear and consistent, otherwise [it] will burden the industry.\u201d\n\nIn terms of operations, MUVATA hopes that the authorities understand that unlike businesses trading in new auto parts, traders of used parts need to carry out minor dismantling work in order to obtain said used parts, such as by taking apart a large group of components to acquire smaller, individual parts.\n\nThe association suggests that enforcement agencies have perhaps misunderstood used auto parts as being under the manufacturing sector, and therefore have not allowed essential auto parts businesses to operate, and clarifies that the parts selection processes are purely to the customers\u2019 requirements.\n\n\u201cWe wish to convey that it is crucial for new and used auto parts to go hand-in-hand with workshops, as it is useless for workshops to operate without auto parts, new or used,\u201d the statement from MUVATA read. It adds that the logistics sector, which serves transportation for medicine, food and beverage, is reliant on repairs and servicing, and that disruptions in parts supply may see workshops face major challenges.\n\nAccording to an internal survey held by MUVATA, 20% of its members have stated that they are unable to survive, and would be forced to close down if the lockdown is prolonged. While the auto parts sector is listed as an essential category, its members\u2019 business volume has dropped by nearly 70% in this full movement control order (FMCO), it said.\n\nThe association also asks for the government to allow used auto parts companies with the relevant approval letters to operate with a workforce of 60%, for businesses including wholesale, export and the dismantling and sorting of auto parts, and not just for selling to local workshops. In closing, the MUVATA statement reads that \u201cthe industry welcomes the automatic bank loan moratorium, as well as the extension and enhancement of the wage subsidy programme.\u201d\n\nUpon the FMCO taking effect on June 1, vehicle repair (body and paint) and service centres have been allowed to operate at 60% worker capacity, KPDNHEP minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi said at the time. MUVATA also calls for the acceleration of the mass immunisation programme, including for the auto parts sectors as its members\u2019 personnel are customer-facing and therefore are frontliners, as they have to be physically present to discharge their duties and tasks.\n\nMeanwhile in the area of new vehicles, sales are expected to approach zero for the month of June as showrooms nationwide are closed due to the FMCO, with significant financial impact, reported Berita Harian last week. Based on an average vehicle price of RM70,000, the country\u2019s automotive industry is set to lose around RM3.44 billion in revenue due to the sales slump.", "keyword": ["operate", "used",

If there is any honour left in them, they would have resigned.\n\nThere is no excuse and they cannot expect to be fined like other citizens because they represent the SOPs (standard operating procedures), the MCOs and supported the Emergency and everything that came with it.\n\nWhile most opinions tend to be more forgiving of Mustapa and the brunt reserved for Mohd Rashid, ultimately, the wrongs they committed were of equal proportion.\n\nNo doubt, there had been other leaders from the government who had breached the SOPs. By now, whether they got punished or fined just like other ordinary citizens is no longer the issue.\n\nThe offenders from the government should actually tender their resignations and not pass the burden of rectifying their wrongs to the police or other enforcement bodies.\n\nSuch expectations are actually too highly placed, in fact almost delusionary.\n\nHowever, if Prime Minister (PM) Tan Sri Mahiaddin Md Yassin and other senior leaders in the government are still clueless as to why public disaffection towards them is not just simmering but reaching boiling point, they should be told that they suffer from trust deficit from all aspects of governance and administration.\n\nThe issue of being a backdoor government, not having legitimacy and backstabbing their political friends have taken a backseat and overtaken by their inefficiency, flip-flops, ineptitude, double-standards, shady deals, incompetence, cluelessness and repeat all these many folds.\n\nBecause of their inability to rule and manage the nation, all their past sins are catching up with them.\n\nThen there is the tendency of putting their foot in their mouth \u2014 one example is the quote that he can\u2019t be expected to take care of all 32 million Malaysians.\n\nIt may sound honest, but anyone accepting the top post in the government, especially when no one had put the gun to his or her head, meant that the whole populace, whether they are supporters or doubters or opponents, all and sundry are the leader\u2019s responsibility.\n\nIt is then no surprise that today, as the \u201cwhite flag\u201d campaign gathers momentum, it signifies the loss of confidence in the government to resolve their ails and they would probably by now accept they are the ones that did not make it to the list of citizens that the leader could take care of.\n\nA PAS leader who tried to mock the campaign \u2014 aimed at getting those who are too ashamed to seek assistance to put up the flag to signify their desperation \u2014 was either in denial or being defensive as he is part of the \u201cfailed government\u201d.\n\nRoundly censured, PAS is yet another component of the ruling coalition that adds to the missteps of the government, which even without is already overflowing the brim.\n\nIf opinions and actions are insufficient to add to the woes or being publicly denounced, even a prepared statement from the PM\u2019s Office regarding Mahiaddin\u2019s health did not pass public scrutiny.\n\nIn the first place, it is incomprehensible why his office chose to share the one detail that led to the PM being hospitalised and placed under observation.\n\nBy any standards, no one discussed such conditions publicly as problems of the bowel movements at best would only be shared with doctors or in the days of yore, with the dukun or shaman master, or maybe not given their prowess of insights of knowing even without being told.\n\nInstead of sympathy or at least a short truce until the PM is discharged, the choice of word in the statement went trending and nuanced creatively to mock and undermine the government of the day.

Also, some developers are offering buyers to rent with an option to purchase,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve (TMR).\n\nCCO & Associates (KL) Sdn Bhd ED Chan Wai Seen said the rental for residential properties has undergone adjustments since 2015 and many landlords have been charging low rentals in order to attract tenants.\n\n\u201cGenerally, rental rates for newly completed projects or properties located nearby new projects will continue to be highly competitive. Rental rates may gradually improve when properties located within the new projects have achieved high occupancy rates.\n\n\u201cWith the large number of affordable properties coming into the market, we expect rental will remain at a highly competitive level,\u201d he told TMR.\n\nAreca Capital Sdn Bhd CEO Danny Wong Teck Meng said there are two schools of thought.\n\nFirstly, that the supply glut of residential properties is still hanging thus affecting the rental market; and on the other hand, many working adults now prefer to rent rather than buy properties.\n\nWong is of the opinion that it highly depends on the location, adding that the rental market is still soft for the time being.\n\nAsiacap Valuers & Property Consultants Sdn Bhd property valuer Kit Au Yong surmised the property market to remain in a soft condition in 2H21 going into 1H22, with possibly slow gradual improvement in 2H22.\n\n\u201cWe maintain a cautious view about the property market performance. However, the market is treading carefully in response to the current volatile unprecedented short- to mid-term condition,\u201d he said.\n\nLast year\u2019s pandemic shock immensely hurt Malaysia\u2019s economy with its GDP contracting 5.6%.\n\nThis year, the GDP is projected to recover at about 5%-6%.\n\nIn April, Finance Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz said Malaysia\u2019s property market in 2020 experienced a decrease of 9.9% in volume of transactions and 15.8% in value of transactions compared to 2019.\n\nAccording to Property Market 1Q21 Snapshot, Malaysia recorded 80,694 transactions, a contraction of 11.6% compared to 4Q20.\n\nThe government has introduced the Prihatin Rakyat Economic Stimulus Package and the Short-term Economic Recovery Plan, as well as allocations and incentives to help cushion the negative impact on the property market such as the stamp duty exemption.", "keyword": ["better", "rent", "transactions", "market", "property", "demand", "improve", "remain", "properties", "residential", "rental", "economic"], "summary": "\u201cUnable to commit to a purchase, the only option available for those who require accommodation is to rent, hence the residential market will improve.\nFirstly, that the supply glut of residential properties is still hanging thus affecting the rental market; and on the other hand, many working adults now prefer to rent rather than buy properties.\nWong is of the opinion that it highly depends on the location, adding that the rental market is still soft for the time being.\n\u201cWe maintain a cautious view about the property market performance.\nAccording to Property Market 1Q21 Snapshot, Malaysia recorded 80,694 transactions, a contraction of 11.6% compared to 4Q20.", "news": "The Malaysian Reserve", "date": "2021-07-01 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Opposition can\u2019t make headway without a PM candidate, says analyst", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wNi8yMi9vcHBvc2l0aW9uLWNhbnQtbWFrZS1oZWFkd2F5LXdpdGhvdXQtYS1wbS1jYW5kaWRhdGUtc2F5cy1hbmFseXN0L9IBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Minderjeet Kaur"], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FMT-AHMAD-ZAHID-HAMIDI-02.jpg", "text": "PETALING JAYA: Umno and Pakatan Harapan are not likely to call for a confidence vote against Muhyiddin Yassin unless they have agreed on a candidate to be the new prime minister, and until the Covid-19 crisis is under control, say political analysts.\n\nFormer academic Azmi Hassan said Umno\u2019s two-week ultimatum to Muhyiddin was to force the Perikatan Nasional government to do \u201csomething positive\u201d.\n\nUmno president Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said yesterday he gave the PN-led government 14 days to reconvene Parliament.\n\nAzmi said Umno was using the opportunity to put PN in an awkward position.\n\n\u201cThey know (that a Parliament sitting) is not achievable at least until the end of July but they may feel this is the best way to force PN\u2019s hand,\u201d he told FMT.\n\nHe said it was unlikely that any political party would call for a confidence vote against the prime minister when Parliament sits, as the rakyat may accuse the politicians of putting their self-interest above public health.\n\n\u201cThe health issue needs to be addressed first. After that comes jobs, as many people are jobless,\u201d he added.\n\nHowever, he said Umno and Pakatan Harapan may make life difficult for the governing party by not supporting any bills that are presented. \u201cThat\u2019s where problems may arise.\u201d\n\nThose who intended to push for the confidence vote should have a candidate for a new prime minister ready, in case the present government fails to garner a sufficient majority, he said.\n\nKenneth Cheng, a member of the Agora Society, a loose network of intellectuals, told FMT that Umno will only be able to initiate real changes if elections are called.\n\nHe said that even if the party were to withdraw from the government now, it would need to agree with other parties on a prime ministerial candidate.\n\nLast week, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong issued a statement that Parliament should reconvene as soon as possible. A day earlier, Muhyiddin had said that Parliament could meet by September or October at the earliest and only if daily Covid-19 cases dropped below 2,000.\n\nCheng said not all Umno ministers may withdraw from the government in the midst of the pandemic.\n\nUmno would have a better chance of governing the country after a general election as it is expected to gain ground support from rural and urban Malays, he said.\n\n\u201cUntil then, Umno will have to strategise its moves,\u201d he added.\n\nCheng added that it is unclear if Muhyiddin still holds a majority in the Dewan Rakyat, especially after two Umno MPs said they have withdrawn their support. The two are Kelantan Umno chief and Machang MP Ahmad Jazlan Yaakub, and Padang Rengas MP Nazri Aziz, while Gua Musang MP Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah said he refused to back Muhyiddin as prime minister.\n\nCheng said a few MPs may jump ship to support Muhyiddin\u2019s administration.

A funeral mass began at 10am local time, at the Ateneo de Manila University, Aquino\u2019s alma mater, where his funeral urn had been on view on Friday.\n\nAquino\u2019s passing comes as the political landscape shifts in a country dominated by dynasties.\n\nIn recent years, President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s clan based in the south of the Philippines has been dominant. With Duterte patronage, the family of former president and dictator Ferdinand Marcos \u2013 the nemesis of the Aquinos \u2013 has seen its fortunes revive.\n\nAquino\u2019s sudden death prompted much reflection on his six-year term, which ended in 2016 and saw the economic revival of the so called \u201csick man of Asia\u201d.\n\nPresident Duterte declared 10 days of national mourning and called Aquino\u2019s death \u201can opportunity to unite in prayer and set aside our differences\u201d.\n\nAquino, the country\u2019s 15th president, was inaugurated in June 2010 following a landslide election win delivered on the back of a strong anti-graft campaign.\n\nThe former senator had not been his party\u2019s first choice, but calls for him to run mounted after the death in August 2009 of his mother, Corazon Aquino, a former president. For supporters, an Aquino was the answer to the massive corruption plaguing the country.\n\n\u201cI accept the plea of the nation. I also accept the instructions of my parents. I accept the responsibility to continue the fight for our country,\u201d Aquino said when he declared his candidacy.\n\nThat was just 40 days after his mother\u2019s death, and he was speaking in the same venue where she took her oath of office in 1986. Many regarded it as a moment of history repeating itself.\n\nAquino\u2019s father, Sen Benigno \u201cNinoy\u201d Aquino Jr, was assassinated in 1983 on the tarmac of Manila International Airport \u2013 subsequently renamed in his honour \u2013 as he returned from exile in the US.\n\nThe opposition leader\u2019s callous murder was the catalyst for People Power, the revolutionary movement that brought down the Marcos dictatorship and catapulted Corazon Aquino, a housewife, into the presidency.\n\nAlthough he arrived in office on the coattails of his parents, Aquino went on to create a significant legacy in this own right.\n\nHis sound economic management and image of incorruptibility inspired confidence from investors long spooked by crooked politics, coup attempts and corruption scandals.\n\nOn Aquino\u2019s watch, gross domestic product mushroomed to an average of 6% annually, the largest in 40 years. Annual foreign direct investment rose to US$8.3 billion in 2016 from just US$2 billion before he entered office. The country\u2019s credit ratings all went up.\n\nThe last president also strengthened the old defence alliance with the US In 2013, he challenged China\u2019s expansion claims in the disputed South China Sea.\n\nThe country\u2019s most powerful neighbour lost international arbitration at The Hague in a ruling handed down a week after Aquino left office. China never recognised the court\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cPresident Aquino\u2019s steadfast commitment to advancing peace, upholding the rule of law, and driving economic growth for all Filipinos, while taking bold steps to promote the rules-based international order, leaves a remarkable legacy at home and abroad that will endure for the years to come,\u201d US President Joe Biden said in a statement.\n\nBut for all his international prestige, reducing domestic poverty and social inequality remained stubborn challenges for Aquino. That created an opening for Duterte \u2013 an outsider who advocated strongarm tactics against national problems.\n\nA week before the 2016 elections, Aquino warned voters off Duterte, implying that he had the makings of a dictator.\n\nStill the mayor of Davao City in the southern province of Mindanao broke the Manila hold on politics and won by a landslide with over six million votes more than closest rival Mar Roxas, Aquino\u2019s anointed successor.\n\nDuterte\u2019s presidency has been markedly different on all scores. He embraced China and distanced himself from the US.\n\nHe launched a brutal drugs war that has killed thousands of alleged offenders \u2013 a bloody campaign that while popular at home was heavily condemned abroad. Duterte also cracked down on business elites associated with Aquino to rally support.\n\nSome regarded Aquino as elitist, and Duterte\u2019s ordinary man image appealed to many Filipinos. The president\u2019s popularity has not waned, and his brash politics have eclipsed the Aquino brand.\n\nIn the 2019 mid-term elections, Duterte-allied candidates, including his former aide Bong Go and police chief Ronald Dela Rosa, won most of the 12 seats on the table. Aquino\u2019s cousin, Paolo Benigno \u201cBam\u201d Aquino IV, meanwhile failed to get re-elected.\n\nAlthough Duterte enjoys overwhelming support, Aquino\u2019s death could have some impact on the political scene, analysts believe.\n\nIt has come less than a year ahead of the May 2022 presidential elections. The early frontrunner is Sara Duterte, the president\u2019s daughter and mayor of Davao.\n\nFerdinand Marcos Jr, \u2013 a former senator and the son of the late president, has also emerged as a strong contender in opinion polls. Marcos lost by a slim margin to Aquino-backed Leni Robredo in the 2016 race for vice president.\n\nDuterte loyalists have meanwhile been urging the still hugely popular president to run as vice-president. This would enable him to continue wielding power by skirting a six-year term limit put in place during the presidency of Corazon Aquino.\n\nThe 1986 constitution included a single term provision to try and prevent a repeat of the Marcos dictatorship.\n\nPeter Mumford, a Southeast Asia analyst at Eurasia Group, thinks the passing of Aquino could boost support for his Liberal Party, which has been flagging in the polls.\n\n\u201cHowever, comparisons with Aquino III\u2019s political rise following the deaths of his parents and the current situation need to be made with caution,\u201d Mumford told Nikkei Asia.\n\n\u201cAquino\u2019s parents were even more popular and revered. Plus, in 2010 there was not a highly popular outgoing president able to whip up mass support for their chosen successor \u2013 as is the case with Duterte now.\u201d\n\nBob Herrera-Lim, an analyst at Teneo, an advisory company, said Aquino\u2019s death \u201cwill eventually deprive supporters of Duterte a common target for their populist attacks\u201d and likely \u201clead to a shift in tactics for the administration\u201d.\n\nThe former president\u2019s passing \u201cwill signal an introspection\u201d ahead of the 2022 presidential elections, said Edna Co, a public administration professor at the University of the Philippines.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not whether we are a fan of PNoy or not,\u201d Co said, using the former president\u2019s popular moniker. \u201cIt\u2019s an introspection of what kind of leadership we had and we would like to have in 2022.\u201d\n\nWhile the dynastic shifts will be closely followed, Co said it would be better if next year\u2019s elections focus more on governance than political clans.\n\n\u201cThe Philippines has been trapped in dynastic politics, but this is already the 21st century,\u201d Co said. \u201cThe next election should be about democratic governance, regardless of who brings it \u2013 I don\u2019t care whether it is a Marcos, Aquino or Duterte.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["marcos", "upper", "gives", "aquino", "popular", "presidents",

Malaysia Used Vehicle Autoparts Traders Association (MUVATA) has called upon the government to clarify the position of new and used automotive parts importers, exporters, wholesalers and retailers it represents to be classified under the spare parts sector, the association wrote in an e-mailed statement.\n\nThe association pleads with the ministry of domestic trade and consumer affairs (KPDNHEP) to clarify that businesses dealing in auto parts are under the spare parts sector, which have been allowed to operate, along with car workshops and tyre shops, under FMCO conditions as of June 1.\n\nIt states that most of its members have received approval to operate from the Covid-19 intelligent management system (CIMS) 3.0 under the purview of the ministry of international trade and industry (MITI), having selected peruncitan, pengedaran dan pemborongan (retail, distribution or wholesaling), with the sub-sectors of bengkel, penyelenggaraan dan alat ganti (workshops, maintenance and spare parts).\n\nReports have, however, been received from a few of its members in Johor Bahru, said MUVATA, saying they have been told by the Johor Bahru City Council (MBJB) that they are to shut down immediately as they are deemed not to be categorised under the auto parts sector, and an MBJB officer said that the alat ganti term for permitted businesses is only applicable to those trading in new auto parts, the statement read.\n\nA similar situation was reportedly encountered by the association\u2019s members in Perak, where the police have deemed the businesses\u2019 selected category on the forms to be incorrect, and therefore have also been told to shut down. MUVATA says that used auto parts business operators are now very confused, and some have not dared to remain open for fear of receiving hefty fines, it said, adding that \u201cguidelines need to be clear and consistent, otherwise [it] will burden the industry.\u201d\n\nIn terms of operations, MUVATA hopes that the authorities understand that unlike businesses trading in new auto parts, traders of used parts need to carry out minor dismantling work in order to obtain said used parts, such as by taking apart a large group of components to acquire smaller, individual parts.\n\nThe association suggests that enforcement agencies have perhaps misunderstood used auto parts as being under the manufacturing sector, and therefore have not allowed essential auto parts businesses to operate, and clarifies that the parts selection processes are purely to the customers\u2019 requirements.\n\n\u201cWe wish to convey that it is crucial for new and used auto parts to go hand-in-hand with workshops, as it is useless for workshops to operate without auto parts, new or used,\u201d the statement from MUVATA read. It adds that the logistics sector, which serves transportation for medicine, food and beverage, is reliant on repairs and servicing, and that disruptions in parts supply may see workshops face major challenges.\n\nAccording to an internal survey held by MUVATA, 20% of its members have stated that they are unable to survive, and would be forced to close down if the lockdown is prolonged. While the auto parts sector is listed as an essential category, its members\u2019 business volume has dropped by nearly 70% in this full movement control order (FMCO), it said.\n\nThe association also asks for the government to allow used auto parts companies with the relevant approval letters to operate with a workforce of 60%, for businesses including wholesale, export and the dismantling and sorting of auto parts, and not just for selling to local workshops. In closing, the MUVATA statement reads that \u201cthe industry welcomes the automatic bank loan moratorium, as well as the extension and enhancement of the wage subsidy programme.\u201d\n\nUpon the FMCO taking effect on June 1, vehicle repair (body and paint) and service centres have been allowed to operate at 60% worker capacity, KPDNHEP minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi said at the time. MUVATA also calls for the acceleration of the mass immunisation programme, including for the auto parts sectors as its members\u2019 personnel are customer-facing and therefore are frontliners, as they have to be physically present to discharge their duties and tasks.\n\nMeanwhile in the area of new vehicles, sales are expected to approach zero for the month of June as showrooms nationwide are closed due to the FMCO, with significant financial impact, reported Berita Harian last week. Based on an average vehicle price of RM70,000, the country\u2019s automotive industry is set to lose around RM3.44 billion in revenue due to the sales slump.", "keyword": ["operate", "used",

If there is any honour left in them, they would have resigned.\n\nThere is no excuse and they cannot expect to be fined like other citizens because they represent the SOPs (standard operating procedures), the MCOs and supported the Emergency and everything that came with it.\n\nWhile most opinions tend to be more forgiving of Mustapa and the brunt reserved for Mohd Rashid, ultimately, the wrongs they committed were of equal proportion.\n\nNo doubt, there had been other leaders from the government who had breached the SOPs. By now, whether they got punished or fined just like other ordinary citizens is no longer the issue.\n\nThe offenders from the government should actually tender their resignations and not pass the burden of rectifying their wrongs to the police or other enforcement bodies.\n\nSuch expectations are actually too highly placed, in fact almost delusionary.\n\nHowever, if Prime Minister (PM) Tan Sri Mahiaddin Md Yassin and other senior leaders in the government are still clueless as to why public disaffection towards them is not just simmering but reaching boiling point, they should be told that they suffer from trust deficit from all aspects of governance and administration.\n\nThe issue of being a backdoor government, not having legitimacy and backstabbing their political friends have taken a backseat and overtaken by their inefficiency, flip-flops, ineptitude, double-standards, shady deals, incompetence, cluelessness and repeat all these many folds.\n\nBecause of their inability to rule and manage the nation, all their past sins are catching up with them.\n\nThen there is the tendency of putting their foot in their mouth \u2014 one example is the quote that he can\u2019t be expected to take care of all 32 million Malaysians.\n\nIt may sound honest, but anyone accepting the top post in the government, especially when no one had put the gun to his or her head, meant that the whole populace, whether they are supporters or doubters or opponents, all and sundry are the leader\u2019s responsibility.\n\nIt is then no surprise that today, as the \u201cwhite flag\u201d campaign gathers momentum, it signifies the loss of confidence in the government to resolve their ails and they would probably by now accept they are the ones that did not make it to the list of citizens that the leader could take care of.\n\nA PAS leader who tried to mock the campaign \u2014 aimed at getting those who are too ashamed to seek assistance to put up the flag to signify their desperation \u2014 was either in denial or being defensive as he is part of the \u201cfailed government\u201d.\n\nRoundly censured, PAS is yet another component of the ruling coalition that adds to the missteps of the government, which even without is already overflowing the brim.\n\nIf opinions and actions are insufficient to add to the woes or being publicly denounced, even a prepared statement from the PM\u2019s Office regarding Mahiaddin\u2019s health did not pass public scrutiny.\n\nIn the first place, it is incomprehensible why his office chose to share the one detail that led to the PM being hospitalised and placed under observation.\n\nBy any standards, no one discussed such conditions publicly as problems of the bowel movements at best would only be shared with doctors or in the days of yore, with the dukun or shaman master, or maybe not given their prowess of insights of knowing even without being told.\n\nInstead of sympathy or at least a short truce until the PM is discharged, the choice of word in the statement went trending and nuanced creatively to mock and undermine the government of the day.

Also, some developers are offering buyers to rent with an option to purchase,\u201d he told The Malaysian Reserve (TMR).\n\nCCO & Associates (KL) Sdn Bhd ED Chan Wai Seen said the rental for residential properties has undergone adjustments since 2015 and many landlords have been charging low rentals in order to attract tenants.\n\n\u201cGenerally, rental rates for newly completed projects or properties located nearby new projects will continue to be highly competitive. Rental rates may gradually improve when properties located within the new projects have achieved high occupancy rates.\n\n\u201cWith the large number of affordable properties coming into the market, we expect rental will remain at a highly competitive level,\u201d he told TMR.\n\nAreca Capital Sdn Bhd CEO Danny Wong Teck Meng said there are two schools of thought.\n\nFirstly, that the supply glut of residential properties is still hanging thus affecting the rental market; and on the other hand, many working adults now prefer to rent rather than buy properties.\n\nWong is of the opinion that it highly depends on the location, adding that the rental market is still soft for the time being.\n\nAsiacap Valuers & Property Consultants Sdn Bhd property valuer Kit Au Yong surmised the property market to remain in a soft condition in 2H21 going into 1H22, with possibly slow gradual improvement in 2H22.\n\n\u201cWe maintain a cautious view about the property market performance. However, the market is treading carefully in response to the current volatile unprecedented short- to mid-term condition,\u201d he said.\n\nLast year\u2019s pandemic shock immensely hurt Malaysia\u2019s economy with its GDP contracting 5.6%.\n\nThis year, the GDP is projected to recover at about 5%-6%.\n\nIn April, Finance Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz said Malaysia\u2019s property market in 2020 experienced a decrease of 9.9% in volume of transactions and 15.8% in value of transactions compared to 2019.\n\nAccording to Property Market 1Q21 Snapshot, Malaysia recorded 80,694 transactions, a contraction of 11.6% compared to 4Q20.\n\nThe government has introduced the Prihatin Rakyat Economic Stimulus Package and the Short-term Economic Recovery Plan, as well as allocations and incentives to help cushion the negative impact on the property market such as the stamp duty exemption.", "keyword": ["better", "rent", "transactions", "market", "property", "demand", "improve", "remain", "properties", "residential", "rental", "economic"], "summary": "\u201cUnable to commit to a purchase, the only option available for those who require accommodation is to rent, hence the residential market will improve.\nFirstly, that the supply glut of residential properties is still hanging thus affecting the rental market; and on the other hand, many working adults now prefer to rent rather than buy properties.\nWong is of the opinion that it highly depends on the location, adding that the rental market is still soft for the time being.\n\u201cWe maintain a cautious view about the property market performance.\nAccording to Property Market 1Q21 Snapshot, Malaysia recorded 80,694 transactions, a contraction of 11.6% compared to 4Q20.", "news": "The Malaysian Reserve", "date": "2021-07-01 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Opposition can\u2019t make headway without a PM candidate, says analyst", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wNi8yMi9vcHBvc2l0aW9uLWNhbnQtbWFrZS1oZWFkd2F5LXdpdGhvdXQtYS1wbS1jYW5kaWRhdGUtc2F5cy1hbmFseXN0L9IBAA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Minderjeet Kaur"], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FMT-AHMAD-ZAHID-HAMIDI-02.jpg", "text": "PETALING JAYA: Umno and Pakatan Harapan are not likely to call for a confidence vote against Muhyiddin Yassin unless they have agreed on a candidate to be the new prime minister, and until the Covid-19 crisis is under control, say political analysts.\n\nFormer academic Azmi Hassan said Umno\u2019s two-week ultimatum to Muhyiddin was to force the Perikatan Nasional government to do \u201csomething positive\u201d.\n\nUmno president Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said yesterday he gave the PN-led government 14 days to reconvene Parliament.\n\nAzmi said Umno was using the opportunity to put PN in an awkward position.\n\n\u201cThey know (that a Parliament sitting) is not achievable at least until the end of July but they may feel this is the best way to force PN\u2019s hand,\u201d he told FMT.\n\nHe said it was unlikely that any political party would call for a confidence vote against the prime minister when Parliament sits, as the rakyat may accuse the politicians of putting their self-interest above public health.\n\n\u201cThe health issue needs to be addressed first. After that comes jobs, as many people are jobless,\u201d he added.\n\nHowever, he said Umno and Pakatan Harapan may make life difficult for the governing party by not supporting any bills that are presented. \u201cThat\u2019s where problems may arise.\u201d\n\nThose who intended to push for the confidence vote should have a candidate for a new prime minister ready, in case the present government fails to garner a sufficient majority, he said.\n\nKenneth Cheng, a member of the Agora Society, a loose network of intellectuals, told FMT that Umno will only be able to initiate real changes if elections are called.\n\nHe said that even if the party were to withdraw from the government now, it would need to agree with other parties on a prime ministerial candidate.\n\nLast week, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong issued a statement that Parliament should reconvene as soon as possible. A day earlier, Muhyiddin had said that Parliament could meet by September or October at the earliest and only if daily Covid-19 cases dropped below 2,000.\n\nCheng said not all Umno ministers may withdraw from the government in the midst of the pandemic.\n\nUmno would have a better chance of governing the country after a general election as it is expected to gain ground support from rural and urban Malays, he said.\n\n\u201cUntil then, Umno will have to strategise its moves,\u201d he added.\n\nCheng added that it is unclear if Muhyiddin still holds a majority in the Dewan Rakyat, especially after two Umno MPs said they have withdrawn their support. The two are Kelantan Umno chief and Machang MP Ahmad Jazlan Yaakub, and Padang Rengas MP Nazri Aziz, while Gua Musang MP Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah said he refused to back Muhyiddin as prime minister.\n\nCheng said a few MPs may jump ship to support Muhyiddin\u2019s administration.

A funeral mass began at 10am local time, at the Ateneo de Manila University, Aquino\u2019s alma mater, where his funeral urn had been on view on Friday.\n\nAquino\u2019s passing comes as the political landscape shifts in a country dominated by dynasties.\n\nIn recent years, President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s clan based in the south of the Philippines has been dominant. With Duterte patronage, the family of former president and dictator Ferdinand Marcos \u2013 the nemesis of the Aquinos \u2013 has seen its fortunes revive.\n\nAquino\u2019s sudden death prompted much reflection on his six-year term, which ended in 2016 and saw the economic revival of the so called \u201csick man of Asia\u201d.\n\nPresident Duterte declared 10 days of national mourning and called Aquino\u2019s death \u201can opportunity to unite in prayer and set aside our differences\u201d.\n\nAquino, the country\u2019s 15th president, was inaugurated in June 2010 following a landslide election win delivered on the back of a strong anti-graft campaign.\n\nThe former senator had not been his party\u2019s first choice, but calls for him to run mounted after the death in August 2009 of his mother, Corazon Aquino, a former president. For supporters, an Aquino was the answer to the massive corruption plaguing the country.\n\n\u201cI accept the plea of the nation. I also accept the instructions of my parents. I accept the responsibility to continue the fight for our country,\u201d Aquino said when he declared his candidacy.\n\nThat was just 40 days after his mother\u2019s death, and he was speaking in the same venue where she took her oath of office in 1986. Many regarded it as a moment of history repeating itself.\n\nAquino\u2019s father, Sen Benigno \u201cNinoy\u201d Aquino Jr, was assassinated in 1983 on the tarmac of Manila International Airport \u2013 subsequently renamed in his honour \u2013 as he returned from exile in the US.\n\nThe opposition leader\u2019s callous murder was the catalyst for People Power, the revolutionary movement that brought down the Marcos dictatorship and catapulted Corazon Aquino, a housewife, into the presidency.\n\nAlthough he arrived in office on the coattails of his parents, Aquino went on to create a significant legacy in this own right.\n\nHis sound economic management and image of incorruptibility inspired confidence from investors long spooked by crooked politics, coup attempts and corruption scandals.\n\nOn Aquino\u2019s watch, gross domestic product mushroomed to an average of 6% annually, the largest in 40 years. Annual foreign direct investment rose to US$8.3 billion in 2016 from just US$2 billion before he entered office. The country\u2019s credit ratings all went up.\n\nThe last president also strengthened the old defence alliance with the US In 2013, he challenged China\u2019s expansion claims in the disputed South China Sea.\n\nThe country\u2019s most powerful neighbour lost international arbitration at The Hague in a ruling handed down a week after Aquino left office. China never recognised the court\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cPresident Aquino\u2019s steadfast commitment to advancing peace, upholding the rule of law, and driving economic growth for all Filipinos, while taking bold steps to promote the rules-based international order, leaves a remarkable legacy at home and abroad that will endure for the years to come,\u201d US President Joe Biden said in a statement.\n\nBut for all his international prestige, reducing domestic poverty and social inequality remained stubborn challenges for Aquino. That created an opening for Duterte \u2013 an outsider who advocated strongarm tactics against national problems.\n\nA week before the 2016 elections, Aquino warned voters off Duterte, implying that he had the makings of a dictator.\n\nStill the mayor of Davao City in the southern province of Mindanao broke the Manila hold on politics and won by a landslide with over six million votes more than closest rival Mar Roxas, Aquino\u2019s anointed successor.\n\nDuterte\u2019s presidency has been markedly different on all scores. He embraced China and distanced himself from the US.\n\nHe launched a brutal drugs war that has killed thousands of alleged offenders \u2013 a bloody campaign that while popular at home was heavily condemned abroad. Duterte also cracked down on business elites associated with Aquino to rally support.\n\nSome regarded Aquino as elitist, and Duterte\u2019s ordinary man image appealed to many Filipinos. The president\u2019s popularity has not waned, and his brash politics have eclipsed the Aquino brand.\n\nIn the 2019 mid-term elections, Duterte-allied candidates, including his former aide Bong Go and police chief Ronald Dela Rosa, won most of the 12 seats on the table. Aquino\u2019s cousin, Paolo Benigno \u201cBam\u201d Aquino IV, meanwhile failed to get re-elected.\n\nAlthough Duterte enjoys overwhelming support, Aquino\u2019s death could have some impact on the political scene, analysts believe.\n\nIt has come less than a year ahead of the May 2022 presidential elections. The early frontrunner is Sara Duterte, the president\u2019s daughter and mayor of Davao.\n\nFerdinand Marcos Jr, \u2013 a former senator and the son of the late president, has also emerged as a strong contender in opinion polls. Marcos lost by a slim margin to Aquino-backed Leni Robredo in the 2016 race for vice president.\n\nDuterte loyalists have meanwhile been urging the still hugely popular president to run as vice-president. This would enable him to continue wielding power by skirting a six-year term limit put in place during the presidency of Corazon Aquino.\n\nThe 1986 constitution included a single term provision to try and prevent a repeat of the Marcos dictatorship.\n\nPeter Mumford, a Southeast Asia analyst at Eurasia Group, thinks the passing of Aquino could boost support for his Liberal Party, which has been flagging in the polls.\n\n\u201cHowever, comparisons with Aquino III\u2019s political rise following the deaths of his parents and the current situation need to be made with caution,\u201d Mumford told Nikkei Asia.\n\n\u201cAquino\u2019s parents were even more popular and revered. Plus, in 2010 there was not a highly popular outgoing president able to whip up mass support for their chosen successor \u2013 as is the case with Duterte now.\u201d\n\nBob Herrera-Lim, an analyst at Teneo, an advisory company, said Aquino\u2019s death \u201cwill eventually deprive supporters of Duterte a common target for their populist attacks\u201d and likely \u201clead to a shift in tactics for the administration\u201d.\n\nThe former president\u2019s passing \u201cwill signal an introspection\u201d ahead of the 2022 presidential elections, said Edna Co, a public administration professor at the University of the Philippines.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not whether we are a fan of PNoy or not,\u201d Co said, using the former president\u2019s popular moniker. \u201cIt\u2019s an introspection of what kind of leadership we had and we would like to have in 2022.\u201d\n\nWhile the dynastic shifts will be closely followed, Co said it would be better if next year\u2019s elections focus more on governance than political clans.\n\n\u201cThe Philippines has been trapped in dynastic politics, but this is already the 21st century,\u201d Co said. \u201cThe next election should be about democratic governance, regardless of who brings it \u2013 I don\u2019t care whether it is a Marcos, Aquino or Duterte.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["marcos", "upper", "gives", "aquino", "popular", "presidents",
