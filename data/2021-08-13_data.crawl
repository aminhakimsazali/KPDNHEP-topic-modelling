Thus, he urged the government to manage the sales and distribution of self-test kits efficiently via subsidisation or price control mechanisms, and immediately curb and end sales of fake kits as well as sales by unqualified sellers.\n\n\n\nIn view of potential price control mechanisms, MPS suggested that the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) give a one-month grace period before implementation as the move would assist pharmacists who have already purchased the self-test kits at a higher cost to clear the more expensive stock.\n\n\u201cIn the event a grace period is not granted, MPS wants a subsidy or refund mechanism be put in place to avoid losses to pharmacists who purchased the stocks in good faith.\n\n\u201cIn ensuring price controls benefit the public, KPDNHEP must ensure price controls include not only standardisation of the sales price but also control of the cost price from the supplier,\u201d Amrahi noted.\n\nHe said this is because MPS has received numerous complaints from the public and pharmacists that self-test kits are being sold online and via WhatsApp at extremely low prices and with no guarantee of the product being genuine.\n\nAs KPDNHEP only has a general complaints page, MPS also suggested that a dedicated page be set up to enable complaints against fake products and sales by non-pharmacists and non-doctors.\n\nAmrahi said this would enable turnover of complaints to be handled quickly and efficiently by the KPDNHEP enforcement arm.\n\nHe added that it is critical that a mechanism to identify fake and genuine stock of self-test kits be implemented to further protect the public.\n\n\u201cSuppliers of self-test kits, KPDNHEP and the Malaysian Device Authority (MDA) should work on this immediately,\u201d he stressed.\n\nAdditionally, he said KPDNHEP should also help enforce MDA\u2019s policy for conditional approval that allows only licensed pharmacies and healthcare facilities to sell selftest kits

These expanded measures will take effect today (16 August 2021).\n\n\u201cThe government understands that many personal activities have been disrupted as a result of this pandemic. This includes buying household items and doing basic upkeep like haircuts. The government is aware, the longer this is restricted, the greater the risk to the mental and physical health of the people,\u201d PM Muhyiddin said.\n\nThe government also sees that, he added, it is very important for economic sectors to reopen in stages because if the situation persists, the impact especially on business owners and their employees will be worse.\n\nThe latest series of updates are explained in detail below, and cover the following:\n\nThe 11 more sectors allowed to operate in Phase One of National Recovery Plan\n\nThe additional 11 sectors allowed to operate in Phase Two of National Recovery Plan\n\nManufacturing, construction, mining, and quarrying activities to resume, based on percentage of fully-vaccinated workforce\n\nVisiting parks for exercising and for recreational activities to be allowed (for individual activities only)\n\nPlans for travel bubble to pilot with Langkawi Island\n\nScroll below for the updates.\n\nUpdates to Phase One of National Recovery Plan\n\nIn that regard, for states under Phase One of NRP, there are 11 business sectors that are allowed to operate, effective 16 August 2021. They are:\n\nCar wash; Electrical and electronics stores; Household goods and kitchen utensils; Furniture stores; Sports equipment stores; Car accessories stores; Car distribution and sales centre; Morning and farmers\u2019 markets; Clothing, fashion, and accessories stores; Jewellery stores, and Hairdressers and beauty salons (for basic barber services only).\n\nThis decision came after the government assessed the pandemic situation with the risk assessment data conducted by the Ministry of Health Malaysia (MOH), Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) and \u201cafter discussing with all stakeholders in the sectors of interest\u201d.\n\nThe Prime Minister also noted that for clothing, fashion, and accessory stores; jewellery stores; as well as barbershops and beauty salons, there are additional health SOPs that must be adhered to.\n\n\u201cThis includes wearing gloves, limiting business time between employees and customers and not allowing the use of fitting rooms. These SOPs may be complicated but they are for the safety of employees and customers.\n\n\u201cOwners of premises listed in the business that can re-operate must also ensure that customers who enter the premises must show a COVID-19 digital vaccination certificate to prove that the individual has received a complete vaccination,\u201d PM Muhyiddin said.\n\nUpdates to Phase Two of National Recovery Plan\n\nFor states in Phase Two of NRP, an additional 11 business sectors will be allowed to operate (over and above those listed in Phase One), effective 16 August 2021. They are:\n\nPhotographic goods store and photographic services; Second-hand items; Florists and nurseries; Handicraft and souvenir stores; Antique stores; Toy stores; Carpet stores; Creative content and creative industry equipment stores; Outdoor equipment stores (including camping, fishing and other equipment); Cosmetics, skin care, and perfume stores, and Tobacco stores (including vape and electronic cigarettes).\n\n\u201cOwners of premises listed have to ensure that customers who enter the premises must show a COVID-19 digital vaccination certificate to prove that the individual has received a complete vaccination,\u201d the Prime Minister reiterated.\n\nManufacturing, construction, mining, and quarrying activities to resume\n\n\u201cI would also like to inform that the government has agreed to allow all non-essential activities in the manufacturing, construction, mining and quarrying sectors to resume operations from 16 August 2021 in states that are under Phase One, Two, and Three of NRP.\n\n\u201cHowever, the operating capacity depends on the rate of complete vaccination of the workers,\u201d PM Muhyiddin said.\n\nThis translates into the following:\n\nShould the manufacturing, construction, mining and quarrying business have 80% to 100% of employees fully-vaccinated, then they are allowed to operate with 100% capacity.\n\nSimilarly, for 60% to 79% of employees fully-vaccinated, then operating capacity is at 80%;\n\nFinally, for 40% to 59% of fully-vaccinated workforce, then operating capacity is at 60%.\n\nFurther, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) reminded that companies are required to declare the number and names of their fully-vaccinated employees in the COVID-19 Intelligent Management System (CIMS) 3.0 system.\n\nUpon declaration, the company may directly download the latest approval letter from the system to operate.\n\nThe government understands, PM Muhyiddin noted, this decision will provoke various reactions from the public who are concerned about the risk of contagion. He reassured that this decision is \u201cmade with care\u201d, and that it is necessary because \u201cmany employers began to reduce the workforce, causing many to lose their jobs\u201d - and the government cannot allow this situation to continue.\n\nPM Muhyiddin added: \u201cI would like to remind all employers to comply with and meet the conditions that have been set before resuming operations to ensure the safety of employees and secure work. At the same time, take full advantage of the wage subsidy initiatives provided by the Government to ensure that every employee receives their salary payment.\u201d\n\nVisiting parks for exercising and for recreational activities\n\nBeyond the economic aspect of Malaysia, the Prime Minister also announced more measures to boost the nation\u2019s mental wellbeing. This is by allowing locals in states under Phase One of NRP to visit parks for exercising and for recreational activities.\n\n\u201cBut remember, only activities that can be done individually such as jogging, cycling and exercising are allowed, in line with the sports and leisure SOPs in Phase One of NRP,\u201d PM Muhyiddin said.\n\nHe added that the public is also only allowed to visit public recreational parks in the neighbourhood; not to cross states, or regions to go to other recreational parks. Local authorities and agencies will monitor the situation, and ensure that health SOPs are adhered to.\n\nPlans for travel bubble to pilot with Langkawi Island\n\nIn his speech, PM Muhyiddin also spoke of the government\u2019s plans to implement a travel bubble at Langkawi Island. This will be a pilot project for the fully-vaccinated, and will be crucial to \u201crevive the tourism industry.\u201d\n\nHe shared that the Ministry of Health (MOH) and health experts have advised the government to implement this plan only when the complete vaccination rate of the population of Langkawi Island reaches at least 80% of the total population.\n\nAs of 15 August 2021, however, according to the COVID-19 Vaccine Supply Assurance Special Committee (Jawatankuasa Khas Jaminan Akses Bekalan Vaksin COVID-19/JKJAV), the nation\u2019s vaccination rate is at 45.9% (with two doses) and at 72.9% (with one dose).\n\nApart from Langkawi Island, PM Muhyiddin said, the government also has plans to implement a tourism bubble approach in more destinations, other than Langkawi Island, throughout the country.\n\n\u201cHowever, this matter is still at the planning stage and the government will look at the results of the pilot project (Langkawi Island) first. If all goes well, the tourism bubble will be implemented more widely,\u201d the Prime Minister added.\n\nAlso read: SOPs for fully-vaccinated individuals in Malaysia: Phases 1, 2 and 3 of NRP [Aug

Pharmacists Society (MPS) is urging the government to step in and protect buyers amid the rise in infections and brought-in-dead (BID) cases.\n\nMPS president Amrahi Buang said they were worried about the unregulated sales of Covid-19 self-test kits, especially via WhatsApp and social media, as well as sales by unqualified sellers who are neither pharmacists nor doctors.\n\n\"Fake Covid-19 self-test kits and wrong use of these kits would produce inaccurate results such as false negatives that would not help in combating the pandemic.\n\n\"Furthermore, with more cases of BID, the government needs to act immediately before the situation worsens,\" he said in a statement on Thursday (Aug 19).\n\nHe added that ideally, self-test kits should be provided free to the public, but if the government is not able to do so, a mechanism to subsidise the cost should be put into place.\n\nThus, MPS is urging the government to manage the sales and distribution of self-test kits efficiently via subsidisation or price control mechanisms, and immediately curb and end sales of fake kits, as well as sales by unqualified sellers.\n\nIn view of potential price control mechanisms, MPS advised the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry to give a grace period of one month before implementation as the move would assist pharmacists who have already purchased the self-test kits at a higher cost to clear the more expensive stock.\n\n\"In the event a grace period is not granted, MPS wants a subsidy or refund mechanism to be put in place to avoid losses to pharmacists who purchased the stocks in good faith.\n\n\"In ensuring price controls benefit the public, the ministry must ensure price controls include not only standardisation of the sales price, but also control of the cost price from the supplier,\" he said.\n\nThis is because MPS has received numerous complaints from the public and from pharmacists of self-test kits being sold online and via WhatsApp at extremely low prices, and with no guarantee of the product being genuine.\n\nAs the ministry only has a general complaints page at https://eaduan.kpdnhep.gov.my/, MPS also suggested that a dedicated page be set up to enable complaints against fake products and sales by non-pharmacists and non-doctors.\n\n\"This would enable turnover of complaints to be handled quickly and efficiently by the ministry's enforcement arm,\" said Amrahi.\n\nHe added that it is critical that a mechanism to identify fake and genuine stock of self-test kits be implemented to further protect the public and suppliers of self-test kits, the ministry and the Malaysian Device Authority (MDA) should work on it immediately.\n\n\"In addition to all the above, the ministry should also help enforce the MDA's policy for conditional approval that allows only licensed pharmacies and healthcare facilities to sell self-test kits online with a proactive approach in barring runners and unqualified sellers from selling self-test kits, as they don\u2019t conform to MDA\u2019s prerequisites of stock-keeping and information sharing with customers,\" he said.", "keyword": ["pharmacists", "kits", "regulation",

David Marshel said DBKL was not looking at the big picture of the issue.\n\n\u201cDBKL should go after the stores that sell illegal and cheap liquor,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen you stop legitimate outlets from selling hard liquor, you will only create illegal ones that may very likely thrive.\n\n\u201cIllegal liquor is bottled to look like the genuine ones. They are sold in the black market.\u201d\n\nMarshel said instead of going after Chinese medicine halls and convenience stores, DBKL should ban the sale of hard liquor at sundry shops, which he said was easily accessible to youths, especially schoolchildren.\n\nAccepting the ruling\n\nMeanwhile the Kuala Lumpur chapter of Federation of Sundry Goods Merchants Association of Malaysia (FSGMAM) has decided not to appeal against DBKL\u2019s new liquor regulations.\n\n\n\nHong says FSGMAM will not appeal against DBKL\u2019s new hard liquor regulations once it comes into force.Its president Hong Chee Meng said the association found the multiple licences that they had to apply from various government agencies like DBKL as well as Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP), too cumbersome.\n\n\u201cRed tape aside, it is also expensive to renew the licence fees annually,\u201d Hong said.\n\n\u201cMany feel that the numerous checks by enforcement authorities such as DBKL, KPDNHEP, the police and Customs were taking its toll.\n\n\u201cThe general feedback from our members in Kuala Lumpur is that they will no longer sell hard liquor on their premises,\u201d he said, adding that in some states, the annual liquor licence fee was as high as RM5,000.\n\nFSGMAM has some 4,000 members nationwide with about 10,000 sundry shops. In Kuala Lumpur, there is slightly over 1,000 members. However, less than 20% sell hard liquor.\n\nDBKL started clamping down on the sale of liquor last June when Annuar called on it to stop issuing liquor licences.\n\nThe move was reportedly aimed at curbing cases of drink-driving but it had not gone down well with stakeholders who were not consulted about it.\n\nBased on DBKL\u2019s records, 2,400 liquor licences have been issued so far and the Excise Licensing Board of the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur (ELBKL) was looking at processing some 1,100 applications pending since 2019.\n\nA source from City Hall said the excise board would meet with members and Kuala Lumpur mayor Datuk Seri Mahadi Che Ngah soon, and a decision would be made on whether to implement or cancel the regulations.\n\n\u201cFrom what I hear, it\u2019s 50/50 right now, so anything can happen,\u201d added the source.\n\nELBKL chairman Datuk Jason Lau Beng Wei confirmed that a meeting was being planned to discuss the matter.\n\n\u201cFor now I have no comments but please bear with us on this,\u201d he said.", "keyword": ["liquor", "prior", "impose", "blanket", "dbkl", "ban", "hard", "sell", "association", "discussions", "sale", "chinese", "stakeholders", "decision", "shops", "appeal", "members"], "summary": "Effective Oct 1, they will no longer be allowed to sell hard liquor.\nThose who want to buy hard liquor can still do so at liquor shops, pubs, bars, restaurants as well as supermarkets and hypermarkets in shopping complexes.\nSeveral members expressed their disappointment last year when DBKL decided to impose the blanket ban on the sale of hard liquor without holding discussions with stakeholders.\n\u201cWhen you stop legitimate outlets from selling hard liquor, you will only create illegal ones that may very likely thrive.\nHowever, less than 20% sell hard liquor.", "news": "The Star Online", "date": "2021-08-16 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Toyota celebrates 50m Corollas sold worldwide", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWFsYXlzaWFucmVzZXJ2ZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wOC8xNy90b3lvdGEtY2VsZWJyYXRlcy01MG0tY29yb2xsYXMtc29sZC13b3JsZHdpZGUv0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVtYWxheXNpYW5yZXNlcnZlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA4LzE3L3RveW90YS1jZWxlYnJhdGVzLTUwbS1jb3JvbGxhcy1zb2xkLXdvcmxkd2lkZS9hbXAv?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://themalaysianreserve.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Toyota.jpg", "text": "by BERNAMA / pic by AFP\n\nKUALA LUMPUR \u2013 Japanese carmaker Toyota has sold 50 million units of its Corolla model worldwide with 300,000 sold in the Malaysian market to date.\n\nPresident of UMW Toyota Motor Ravindran K said the success of the model was due to it being a new standard of automotive excellence in this class of cars, offering customers a dynamic and advanced sedan with luxurious styling.\n\n\u201cEach generation, right from the very first, has been a contributor in the brand transformation.

This was despite Low not having any official 1MDB positions.\n\nMohd Hazem went on to assert his belief that Najib as the prime minister was part of Low\u2019s \u201cscheme\u201d for 1MDB, also claiming that Najib had allegedly known that 1MDB\u2019s funds had gone missing but that the then prime minister was purportedly putting on a \u201cdrama\u201d by allegedly pretending to enquire about the funds\u2019 status.\n\nMohd Hazem said all this while testifying as the 10th prosecution witness against Najib in the latter\u2019s trial involving more than RM2 billion of 1MDB funds.\n\nUnder cross-examination by Najib\u2019s lawyer Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah, Mohd Hazem agreed that former 1MDB senior management officials Terence Geh and Jasmine Loo were directly under Low\u2019s control and that he knew from the beginning when he became CEO that the duo\u2019s loyalty was only to Low and not to 1MDB. The two officials were supposed to be under Hazem\u2019s supervision as the CEO.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the two 1MDB officials acted solely at Low\u2019s direction and that they were not necessarily acting for the interests of 1MDB, Mohd Hazem said he did not do anything to avoid this situation as he equated Low and Najib together.\n\nShafee: Now I want to confront you with this important question, why didn\u2019t you do anything about it? Why didn\u2019t you at least bring this up to the board of directors?\n\nHazem: I think we go back to what I told before, they are the people of Jho Low, and Jho Low basically is the prime minister.\n\nWhen Shafee asked if he had attempt to clarify if Low was the actual alter ego of the then prime minister Najib, Hazem said he had spoke with 1MDB then chairman Tan Sri Lodin Wok Kamaruddin, 1MDB then director Tan Sri Ismee Ismail and Najib\u2019s then principal private secretary Datuk Azlin Alias. Hazem later said he had done his best to speak to the relevant personnel who have \u201cdirect access\u201d to the prime minister.\n\nHazem claimed that Lodin and the whole 1MDB board already knew that the company was being run by Low.\n\nAsked for what he specifically told Lodin about both Geh and Loo, Hazem said most of their conversations revolved around their \u201cconcerns of Jho Low handling 1MDB\u201d.\n\nHazem said that he had basically told Lodin about 1MDB being in Low\u2019s \u201chands\u201d and expressed concern over Low running or controlling the company, adding that Lodin had also shared the same concerns.\n\nAsked by Shafee, Hazem confirmed that he had never asked or suggested to Lodin for them to confirm with then PM Najib on what is Low\u2019s role and whether Low controlled 1MDB to the exclusion of Hazem as the CEO.\n\nShafee: But you agree the way you described Jho Low controlling the senior management, you were virtually not the CEO?\n\nHazem: Yes.\n\nShafee: Jho Low was running the company through the management?\n\nHazem: Yes, in a way.\n\nHazem confirmed that he did not suggest to Lodin for them to resolve this by checking with then prime minister Najib if this was how the company 1MDB is to operate, and that he did not take any other measures and did not know if Lodin had asked Najib about such issues.\n\nShafee then suggested that Hazem was making presumptions without evidence that \u201cJho Low is the prime minister and the prime minister is Jho Low\u201d and that Low\u2019s directions essentially came from Najib, but Hazem pointed to meetings where both Najib and Low were present regarding 1MDB matters.\n\nHazem specifically cited a November 28, 2013 meeting at Najib\u2019s house at Jalan Langgak Duta attended by 1MDB officials and BSI Singapore representative Yak Yew Chee, where Low was present and had started the meeting by briefing about 1MDB matters such as 1MDB\u2019s US$2.3 billion funds that were purportedly invested overseas under the custody of BSI Bank and what BSI Bank had told 1MDB auditor KPMG about the funds.\n\nWhen asked how the November 2013 meeting showed that directives from Low to 1MDB management are what Najib has directed, Hazem replied: \u201cThis is with regards to 1MDB, why would Jho Low need to be there?\u201d\n\nHazem later also pointed out that Low was an \u201cexternal party\u201d and had attending the meeting at the prime minister\u2019s house on 1MDB matters, saying that this was evidence that Low was representing Najib\u2019s interests: \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that he (Low) shouldn\u2019t be there at all. He was there and accepted in the meeting.\u201d\n\nHazem confirmed that he had never asked Najib on what Low\u2019s role was and how he was supposed to react as CEO.\n\nHazem had previously described Low as Najib\u2019s trusted right-hand man, proxy and special adviser for 1MDB.\n\nAbout the bonus\n\nShafee: You said truly you were not a CEO.\n\nHazem: Yes.\n\nShafee: You were virtually led by the nose with the greatest respect?\n\nHazem: Yes.\n\nHazem agreed with Shafee that he was concerned and ashamed at having being reduced to being impotent as a CEO and that this affected his pride, adding that he had very little control or no control over the matter.\n\nShafee then repeatedly grilled Hazem about the decision in a 1MDB board meeting on April 22, 2014 \u2014 which Hazem had excused himself from \u2014 to give him a bonus after the 1MDB remuneration committee assessed his performance as having \u201cexceeded expectations\u201d.\n\nShafee repeatedly questioned whether Hazem had felt ashamed for receiving a bonus on top of his monthly salary of more than RM90,000 when the company was allegedly going down the drain and when his pride was affected as he was led by the nose as a CEO.\n\nDeputy public prosecutor Akram Ahmad Gharib then said such questions were not relevant to the charges that Najib was facing and that Hazem had already answered that it was a decision made by the 1MDB board.\n\nShafee explained that he was trying to challenge Hazem\u2019s credibility: \u201cI\u2019m trying to show the inconsistent answers he has provided, namely on one hand he said he felt ashamed, his pride is affected because as a CEO he was completely not CEO, Jho Low was CEO, so he was not doing any work, he was just taking orders virtually, so if your pride is affected, naturally the question is why do you receive so much bonus and how do you feel?\u201d\n\nHazem later said he was not ashamed to have received his salary and bonus worth a combined RM2.9 million for the entire year of 2014 as he had done his job as required to meet targets set by the 1MDB board.\n\nHazem disagreed with Shafee\u2019s suggestion that he was purportedly shameless in receiving the salary and bonus as he was part of a purported conspiracy with Low to hoodwink 1MDB.\n\nWas it a \u2018drama\u2019?\n\nShafee highlighted the November 28, 2013 meeting at Najib\u2019s house and another meeting where Hazem was subsequently recorded as informing KPMG on another day that BSI Bank\u2019s Yak had assured the prime minister that 1MDB\u2019s US$2.3 billion investment was intact.\n\nHazem said he did not know for a fact at that point that the funds had disappeared, but had suspected that the funds \u201cprobably have disappeared\u201d.\n\nShafee then questioned why Hazem had not asked to speak privately to then prime minister Najib and share his suspicions about 1MDB funds to help save the company and the country, with Hazem then saying he believed Najib already knew the funds were gone.\n\nHazem: Because as far as I\u2019m concerned, the prime minister knows it, he is part of the scheme.\n\nShafee: The prime minister knows the money disappeared?\n\nHazem: From the very beginning I told you, the presence of Jho Low is the prime minister, that was what I was told.\n\nHazem however agreed he had never confirmed if Low was \u201ctruly the PM\u201d and agreed that he was making a presumption that Najib already knew the 1MDB funds were missing.\n\nShafee: Do you think Datuk Seri Najib, at that meeting, do you think Datuk Seri Najib when he asked for the assurance of the funds, he was being briefed about the funds, all those meetings, are you saying Datuk Seri Najib was pretending to ask all these questions because he knows the money disappeared?\n\nHazem: I won\u2019t answer on his behalf.\n\nShafee: I\u2019m asking you, are you saying Datuk Seri Najib when he was being briefed about the funds, it was all a drama by Datuk Seri Najib?\n\nHazem: Yes.\n\nHazem later disagreed with Shafee\u2019s suggestion that it was not Najib trying to put on a drama about the 1MDB funds, and disagreed that it was Hazem, Yak and Low trying to put on the alleged drama to impress Najib and 1MDB board members.\n\nNajib\u2019s 1MDB trial before High Court judge Collin Lawrence Sequerah resumes tomorrow morning. \u2014 Malay Mail", "keyword": ["low",

region, with Singapore, Mainland China and Hong Kong trailing at 67%, 45% and 48%, respectively.\n\nIn a statement, it said more than seven in 10 respondents in Malaysia said they would feel unsafe in their workplace until others around them were fully inoculated against Covid-19 \u2013 12% higher than their Singaporean counterparts (61%).\n\nOf the respondents who were working on-site amid the pandemic, 55% said they felt continuously at risk of infection. Almost three in five (59%) saw their productivity levels suffer as they were perpetually stressed about getting infected at their workplace and compromising the health of their loved ones.\n\nDespite their health and safety concerns, less than one in two respondents (47%) said their employers have incentivised them to get vaccinated against Covid-19.\n\nFahad Naeem, head of operations at Randstad Malaysia, said: \u201cIt is not a surprise that people put a premium on their health and safety during a pandemic.\n\n\u201cIn doing so, workers also expect their employers to take added precautionary measures to safeguard their health and safety. At the minimum, companies should implement stringent health and safety procedures and allow those who are able to work from home to do so.\u201d\n\nFahad said employers should also strengthen their workforce\u2019s herd immunity by actively encouraging workers to take the vaccine.\n\nIn spite of the potential health and safety implications and sharp spikes in the number of Covid-19 cases in Malaysia, 64% of respondents said their employers would like them to work on-site. However, only 49% of the respondents agreed that their job cannot be performed remotely.\n\nNaeem added: \u201cAlthough many companies are eager to return to pre-pandemic activity levels, there is no rush to do so especially when the country is still experiencing a surge in Covid-19 cases.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, companies should prepare for how the return to work would look like after the pandemic. We already know that many employees find themselves more productive and less stressed when working from home, so there is a clear rising employee expectation for hybrid or remote work options.\n\n\u201cIt is hence critical for leaders to start reimagining the future of work, which will drive home the need for new work policies, digital investments and revised office designs to enable hybrid work arrangements and higher work productivity.\u201d\n\nThe survey was conducted in March across 34 markets around the world with a minimum of 400 respondents in each market.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST DATA ON THE COVID-19 SITUATION IN MALAYSIA\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["continue", "respondents", "workplace", "work", "randstad", "shows", "safety", "survey", "employers", "working", "covid19", "health", "69"], "summary": "PETALING JAYA: Sixty-nine per cent of respondents in Malaysia have indicated their preference to continue working from home until the Covid-19 vaccine has been widely distributed, a survey by Randstad, the world\u2019s leading human resources solutions agency, showed.\nAccording to Randstad, the 69% preferring to work from home is the highest in the region, with Singapore, Mainland China and Hong Kong trailing at 67%, 45% and 48%, respectively.\nOf the respondents who were working on-site amid the pandemic, 55% said they felt continuously at risk of infection.\nDespite their health and safety concerns, less than one in two respondents (47%) said their employers have incentivised them to get vaccinated against Covid-19.\n\u201cIn doing so, workers also expect their employers to take added precautionary measures to safeguard their health and safety.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-08-16 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Unity govt can work only with clear terms, say analysts", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wOC8xNy91bml0eS1nb3Z0LWNhbi13b3JrLW9ubHktd2l0aC1jbGVhci10ZXJtcy1zYXktYW5hbHlzdHMv0gEA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Minderjeet Kaur"], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Muhyiddin-Yassin-Letak-Jawatan-FMT_2.jpg", "text": "PETALING JAYA: A unity government will only work if all the kinks are worked out beforehand, and transparent policies outlined without any discrimination, says a political analyst.\n\nFor a unity government to work, the new prime minister must have support across the board, said academician Azmi Hassan.\n\nAll major political parties must be assured of their rights in the government. \u201cOnly then can a unity government be successful,\u201d he told FMT.\n\nThe idea of a unity government was first floated in February 2020 when it was proposed by Dr Mahathir Mohamad after the collapse of the Pakatan Harapan government that he had led.\n\nHe invited rival political parties to link up as no political leader then had majority backing in the Dewan Rakyat.

Not least because, in essence, there was nothing innovative about it.\n\nIn the 1970s, Apple, Atari and Commodore were already producing computer models. But the strength of the IBM PC lay mainly in its ability to outsource the production of its components to other companies.\n\nAs soon as it was released, the company decided to publish the design and software code of the model, allowing other players in the sector to design compatible products.\n\nIn the IBM PC, the processor was an Intel 8088, the floppy drive was from Tandon, and the operating system was Microsoft\u2019s QDOS. IBM, on the other hand, supplied only the monitor, keyboard, and system unit.\n\nLittle by little, the personal computer became more commonplace in homes, whereas its predecessors had failed to earn mass acceptance.\n\nAnd in 1983, Time magazine awarded it the prize for machine of the year, even though the award is generally used to celebrate people.\n\nBacklash to the rapid success\n\nBut the price of fame turned out to be higher than expected. Indeed, in order to be competitive and put out a large quantity, IBM assembled the 5150 prototype in a hurry, without much verification afterwards.\n\nMeanwhile, Bill Gates\u2019s Microsoft, a newcomer to the operating system market, had set about establishing a dominant position.\n\nOther companies, such as Compaq, Dell or HP, were also starting to manufacture personal computers, more or less legally with respect to IBM.\n\nWithin a short time, competitors took over the PC market.

covered his political journey up to when he became the Prime Minister on 29 February 2020.\n\nREAD MORE: The Dark Horse of Malaysian Politics: Muhyiddin Yassin\n\nHowever, let\u2019s take a look at how he got to where he is today and the political scheme of things that have led to him tendering his resignation as the eighth Prime Minister of Malaysia.\n\nWhere The Troubles Began\n\nMahiaddin being sworn in.\n\nAt 72, Mahiaddin was sworn in as Prime Minister by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong on 1 March 2020 after a week of uncertainty following the collapse of Pakatan Harapan government that was led by Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad.\n\nThe Yang di-Pertuan Agong Al-Sultan Abdullah Ri\u2019ayatuddin Al-Mustafa Billah Shah intervened to solve the deadlock by consulting with all Members of Parliament one-by-one in private, before appointing Mahiaddin as the Prime Minister.\n\nAs he was put into the position without a general election or public vote, there was still a chance that Mahiaddin could be replaced when Parliament convened on 9 March 2020. But until then, he had a chance to form a government.\n\nDodging The Bullet\n\nAzhar Azizan Harun.\n\nAlmost immediately there were reports of the 14th Parliamentary Assembly sitting being postponed to May 18. It then became a single day sitting to hear the speech by the Yang di-Pertuan. There. There will be no meeting.\n\nDue to the Covid-19 dangers at the time, a Parliamentary meeting was set for 13 July instead. It was during this meeting that Mahiaddin flexed his support by narrowly clearing a major political test to remove the lower house speaker.\n\nDatuk Azhar Azizan Harun was installed as Dewan Rakyat Speaker after a lunch break without a vote from MPs. The move brought ire from the opposition.\n\nAll motions for a confidence vote were unlikely to happen.\n\nThe Third Wave\n\nElement5 Digital / Unsplash\n\nCovid-19 cases in Malaysia were low. The country was considered one of the best countries in the world to have handled the pandemic. It sustained the people\u2019s confidence in Mahiaddin. But then, a misstep\u2026\n\nThe Sabah state election (26 September to 12 October 2020) resulted in a third wave of Covid-19 cases as people from across the country went there to campaign and then returned home.\n\nAfterwards, the government scrambled to contain the outbreak by imposing a conditional movement order in Sabah and selected states.\n\nThe Hail Mary\n\nAs the number of cases increased, Mahiaddin\u2019s popularity waned. Nothing he did, from the ever-changing MCO and National Recovery Plan to Financial Assistance and SOPs, seemed to work.\n\nAll the while Mahiaddin was operating as the Prime Minister without a deputy. Some speculated that it was done to prevent votes for him from splintering.\n\nThat changed this year (2021) on 7 July when he named Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob as his deputy and Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein as a Senior Minister. A move, some say, was done to placate UMNO and for Mahiaddin to retain a majority.\n\nThe Fumble\n\nParliament, 26 July 2021\n\nOn 26 July 2021, Parliament and Law Minister Datuk Seri Takiyuddin Hassan, stated that Emergency Ordinances, which had been in place since 11 January, were retracted on 21 July.\n\nThe statement was then rebuked by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong who holds the Constitutional right to enact and repeal the Emergency Ordinance.\n\nThe issue fractured Mahiaddin\u2019s already fragile alliance. Because of it, two Ministers and about a dozen MPs pulled their support for the Prime Minister and the opposition challenged his majority.\n\nOn 13 August, Mahiaddin extended an olive branch to the opposition. He promised a General Election, a cross-party framework, and additional funds. But, it did not work. Some even looked at it as a bribe.\n\nToday (16 August), after less than two years, Mahiaddin has resigned his position as Prime Minister.\n\nLet us know on TRP\u2019s Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram!", "keyword": ["months", "malaysias", "17", "8th", "resigned", "installed", "agong", "cases", "mahiaddin", "minister", "prime", "dipertuan", "parliament", "election", "political", "vote"], "summary": "Tan Sri Mahiaddin Md Yasin, also known as Muhyiddin Yassin, had the unenviable task of being the Prime Minister of Malaysia during an unprecedented global pandemic.\nWe have covered his political journey up to when he became the Prime Minister on 29 February 2020.\nThe statement was then rebuked by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong who holds the Constitutional right to enact and repeal the Emergency Ordinance.\nBecause of it, two Ministers and about a dozen MPs pulled their support for the Prime Minister and the opposition challenged his majority.\nToday (16 August), after less than two years, Mahiaddin has resigned his position as Prime Minister.", "news": "The Rakyat Post", "date": "2021-08-16 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Buy And Sell Artisanal Goods On This Uniquely Malaysian e-Commerce Platform", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL2xpdmluZy8yMDIxLzA4LzE4L2J1eS1hbmQtc2VsbC1hcnRpc2FuYWwtZ29vZHMtb24tdGhpcy11bmlxdWVseS1tYWxheXNpYW4tZS1jb21tZXJjZS1wbGF0Zm9ybS_SAYABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlcmFreWF0cG9zdC5jb20vbGl2aW5nLzIwMjEvMDgvMTgvYnV5LWFuZC1zZWxsLWFydGlzYW5hbC1nb29kcy1vbi10aGlzLXVuaXF1ZWx5LW1hbGF5c2lhbi1lLWNvbW1lcmNlLXBsYXRmb3JtL2FtcC8?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Maya Suraya", "Azizul Rahman Ismail"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/TAHFI1.jpg", "text": "Subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates.\n\nThe Artisans Haven (TAH) is an online platform that showcases talented Malaysian artisans and their handmade products.\n\nFirst formed in September 2020, TAH was created as an answer to individuals who suddenly lost their jobs due to Covid-19 and had turned to the handmade artisan sector as a financial lifeline.\n\nAccording to Rosalie Lin, Brand & PR Advisory and co-Founder of TAH, what makes their platform different from other e-Commerce sites is how dedicated the team are to tell the story behind particular products and the sellers behind them.\n\nAnother distinctive feature is also how nothing is ever the same on the platform as most things are handmade, and can be customised to your preference \u2013 like a painting of your pet.\n\nA boost in confidence\n\nJade Lee, CEO and Co-Founder of TAH has made it the company\u2019s mission to boost the confidence of local artisans and micro-entrepreneurs.\n\nOne such entrepreneur is Aesos Lai, who used to run a souvenir gift shop and durian-centric caf\u00e9 at tourist hot spot Central Market.

Thus, he urged the government to manage the sales and distribution of self-test kits efficiently via subsidisation or price control mechanisms, and immediately curb and end sales of fake kits as well as sales by unqualified sellers.\n\n\n\nIn view of potential price control mechanisms, MPS suggested that the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) give a one-month grace period before implementation as the move would assist pharmacists who have already purchased the self-test kits at a higher cost to clear the more expensive stock.\n\n\u201cIn the event a grace period is not granted, MPS wants a subsidy or refund mechanism be put in place to avoid losses to pharmacists who purchased the stocks in good faith.\n\n\u201cIn ensuring price controls benefit the public, KPDNHEP must ensure price controls include not only standardisation of the sales price but also control of the cost price from the supplier,\u201d Amrahi noted.\n\nHe said this is because MPS has received numerous complaints from the public and pharmacists that self-test kits are being sold online and via WhatsApp at extremely low prices and with no guarantee of the product being genuine.\n\nAs KPDNHEP only has a general complaints page, MPS also suggested that a dedicated page be set up to enable complaints against fake products and sales by non-pharmacists and non-doctors.\n\nAmrahi said this would enable turnover of complaints to be handled quickly and efficiently by the KPDNHEP enforcement arm.\n\nHe added that it is critical that a mechanism to identify fake and genuine stock of self-test kits be implemented to further protect the public.\n\n\u201cSuppliers of self-test kits, KPDNHEP and the Malaysian Device Authority (MDA) should work on this immediately,\u201d he stressed.\n\nAdditionally, he said KPDNHEP should also help enforce MDA\u2019s policy for conditional approval that allows only licensed pharmacies and healthcare facilities to sell selftest kits

These expanded measures will take effect today (16 August 2021).\n\n\u201cThe government understands that many personal activities have been disrupted as a result of this pandemic. This includes buying household items and doing basic upkeep like haircuts. The government is aware, the longer this is restricted, the greater the risk to the mental and physical health of the people,\u201d PM Muhyiddin said.\n\nThe government also sees that, he added, it is very important for economic sectors to reopen in stages because if the situation persists, the impact especially on business owners and their employees will be worse.\n\nThe latest series of updates are explained in detail below, and cover the following:\n\nThe 11 more sectors allowed to operate in Phase One of National Recovery Plan\n\nThe additional 11 sectors allowed to operate in Phase Two of National Recovery Plan\n\nManufacturing, construction, mining, and quarrying activities to resume, based on percentage of fully-vaccinated workforce\n\nVisiting parks for exercising and for recreational activities to be allowed (for individual activities only)\n\nPlans for travel bubble to pilot with Langkawi Island\n\nScroll below for the updates.\n\nUpdates to Phase One of National Recovery Plan\n\nIn that regard, for states under Phase One of NRP, there are 11 business sectors that are allowed to operate, effective 16 August 2021. They are:\n\nCar wash; Electrical and electronics stores; Household goods and kitchen utensils; Furniture stores; Sports equipment stores; Car accessories stores; Car distribution and sales centre; Morning and farmers\u2019 markets; Clothing, fashion, and accessories stores; Jewellery stores, and Hairdressers and beauty salons (for basic barber services only).\n\nThis decision came after the government assessed the pandemic situation with the risk assessment data conducted by the Ministry of Health Malaysia (MOH), Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) and \u201cafter discussing with all stakeholders in the sectors of interest\u201d.\n\nThe Prime Minister also noted that for clothing, fashion, and accessory stores; jewellery stores; as well as barbershops and beauty salons, there are additional health SOPs that must be adhered to.\n\n\u201cThis includes wearing gloves, limiting business time between employees and customers and not allowing the use of fitting rooms. These SOPs may be complicated but they are for the safety of employees and customers.\n\n\u201cOwners of premises listed in the business that can re-operate must also ensure that customers who enter the premises must show a COVID-19 digital vaccination certificate to prove that the individual has received a complete vaccination,\u201d PM Muhyiddin said.\n\nUpdates to Phase Two of National Recovery Plan\n\nFor states in Phase Two of NRP, an additional 11 business sectors will be allowed to operate (over and above those listed in Phase One), effective 16 August 2021. They are:\n\nPhotographic goods store and photographic services; Second-hand items; Florists and nurseries; Handicraft and souvenir stores; Antique stores; Toy stores; Carpet stores; Creative content and creative industry equipment stores; Outdoor equipment stores (including camping, fishing and other equipment); Cosmetics, skin care, and perfume stores, and Tobacco stores (including vape and electronic cigarettes).\n\n\u201cOwners of premises listed have to ensure that customers who enter the premises must show a COVID-19 digital vaccination certificate to prove that the individual has received a complete vaccination,\u201d the Prime Minister reiterated.\n\nManufacturing, construction, mining, and quarrying activities to resume\n\n\u201cI would also like to inform that the government has agreed to allow all non-essential activities in the manufacturing, construction, mining and quarrying sectors to resume operations from 16 August 2021 in states that are under Phase One, Two, and Three of NRP.\n\n\u201cHowever, the operating capacity depends on the rate of complete vaccination of the workers,\u201d PM Muhyiddin said.\n\nThis translates into the following:\n\nShould the manufacturing, construction, mining and quarrying business have 80% to 100% of employees fully-vaccinated, then they are allowed to operate with 100% capacity.\n\nSimilarly, for 60% to 79% of employees fully-vaccinated, then operating capacity is at 80%;\n\nFinally, for 40% to 59% of fully-vaccinated workforce, then operating capacity is at 60%.\n\nFurther, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) reminded that companies are required to declare the number and names of their fully-vaccinated employees in the COVID-19 Intelligent Management System (CIMS) 3.0 system.\n\nUpon declaration, the company may directly download the latest approval letter from the system to operate.\n\nThe government understands, PM Muhyiddin noted, this decision will provoke various reactions from the public who are concerned about the risk of contagion. He reassured that this decision is \u201cmade with care\u201d, and that it is necessary because \u201cmany employers began to reduce the workforce, causing many to lose their jobs\u201d - and the government cannot allow this situation to continue.\n\nPM Muhyiddin added: \u201cI would like to remind all employers to comply with and meet the conditions that have been set before resuming operations to ensure the safety of employees and secure work. At the same time, take full advantage of the wage subsidy initiatives provided by the Government to ensure that every employee receives their salary payment.\u201d\n\nVisiting parks for exercising and for recreational activities\n\nBeyond the economic aspect of Malaysia, the Prime Minister also announced more measures to boost the nation\u2019s mental wellbeing. This is by allowing locals in states under Phase One of NRP to visit parks for exercising and for recreational activities.\n\n\u201cBut remember, only activities that can be done individually such as jogging, cycling and exercising are allowed, in line with the sports and leisure SOPs in Phase One of NRP,\u201d PM Muhyiddin said.\n\nHe added that the public is also only allowed to visit public recreational parks in the neighbourhood; not to cross states, or regions to go to other recreational parks. Local authorities and agencies will monitor the situation, and ensure that health SOPs are adhered to.\n\nPlans for travel bubble to pilot with Langkawi Island\n\nIn his speech, PM Muhyiddin also spoke of the government\u2019s plans to implement a travel bubble at Langkawi Island. This will be a pilot project for the fully-vaccinated, and will be crucial to \u201crevive the tourism industry.\u201d\n\nHe shared that the Ministry of Health (MOH) and health experts have advised the government to implement this plan only when the complete vaccination rate of the population of Langkawi Island reaches at least 80% of the total population.\n\nAs of 15 August 2021, however, according to the COVID-19 Vaccine Supply Assurance Special Committee (Jawatankuasa Khas Jaminan Akses Bekalan Vaksin COVID-19/JKJAV), the nation\u2019s vaccination rate is at 45.9% (with two doses) and at 72.9% (with one dose).\n\nApart from Langkawi Island, PM Muhyiddin said, the government also has plans to implement a tourism bubble approach in more destinations, other than Langkawi Island, throughout the country.\n\n\u201cHowever, this matter is still at the planning stage and the government will look at the results of the pilot project (Langkawi Island) first. If all goes well, the tourism bubble will be implemented more widely,\u201d the Prime Minister added.\n\nAlso read: SOPs for fully-vaccinated individuals in Malaysia: Phases 1, 2 and 3 of NRP [Aug

the unregulated sales of Covid-19 self-test kits, especially via WhatsApp and social media, as well as sales by unqualified sellers who are neither pharmacists nor doctors.\n\n\"Fake Covid-19 self-test kits and wrong use of these kits would produce inaccurate results such as false negatives that would not help in combating the pandemic.\n\n\"Furthermore, with more cases of BID, the government needs to act immediately before the situation worsens,\" he said in a statement on Thursday (Aug 19).\n\nHe added that ideally, self-test kits should be provided free to the public, but if the government is not able to do so, a mechanism to subsidise the cost should be put into place.\n\nThus, MPS is urging the government to manage the sales and distribution of self-test kits efficiently via subsidisation or price control mechanisms, and immediately curb and end sales of fake kits, as well as sales by unqualified sellers.\n\nIn view of potential price control mechanisms, MPS advised the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry to give a grace period of one month before implementation as the move would assist pharmacists who have already purchased the self-test kits at a higher cost to clear the more expensive stock.\n\n\"In the event a grace period is not granted, MPS wants a subsidy or refund mechanism to be put in place to avoid losses to pharmacists who purchased the stocks in good faith.\n\n\"In ensuring price controls benefit the public, the ministry must ensure price controls include not only standardisation of the sales price, but also control of the cost price from the supplier,\" he said.\n\nThis is because MPS has received numerous complaints from the public and from pharmacists of self-test kits being sold online and via WhatsApp at extremely low prices, and with no guarantee of the product being genuine.\n\nAs the ministry only has a general complaints page at https://eaduan.kpdnhep.gov.my/, MPS also suggested that a dedicated page be set up to enable complaints against fake products and sales by non-pharmacists and non-doctors.\n\n\"This would enable turnover of complaints to be handled quickly and efficiently by the ministry's enforcement arm,\" said Amrahi.\n\nHe added that it is critical that a mechanism to identify fake and genuine stock of self-test kits be implemented to further protect the public and suppliers of self-test kits, the ministry and the Malaysian Device Authority (MDA) should work on it immediately.\n\n\"In addition to all the above, the ministry should also help enforce the MDA's policy for conditional approval that allows only licensed pharmacies and healthcare facilities to sell self-test kits online with a proactive approach in barring runners and unqualified sellers from selling self-test kits, as they don\u2019t conform to MDA\u2019s prerequisites of stock-keeping and information sharing with customers,\" he said.", "keyword": ["pharmacists", "kits", "regulation",

David Marshel said DBKL was not looking at the big picture of the issue.\n\n\u201cDBKL should go after the stores that sell illegal and cheap liquor,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen you stop legitimate outlets from selling hard liquor, you will only create illegal ones that may very likely thrive.\n\n\u201cIllegal liquor is bottled to look like the genuine ones. They are sold in the black market.\u201d\n\nMarshel said instead of going after Chinese medicine halls and convenience stores, DBKL should ban the sale of hard liquor at sundry shops, which he said was easily accessible to youths, especially schoolchildren.\n\nAccepting the ruling\n\nMeanwhile the Kuala Lumpur chapter of Federation of Sundry Goods Merchants Association of Malaysia (FSGMAM) has decided not to appeal against DBKL\u2019s new liquor regulations.\n\n\n\nHong says FSGMAM will not appeal against DBKL\u2019s new hard liquor regulations once it comes into force.Its president Hong Chee Meng said the association found the multiple licences that they had to apply from various government agencies like DBKL as well as Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP), too cumbersome.\n\n\u201cRed tape aside, it is also expensive to renew the licence fees annually,\u201d Hong said.\n\n\u201cMany feel that the numerous checks by enforcement authorities such as DBKL, KPDNHEP, the police and Customs were taking its toll.\n\n\u201cThe general feedback from our members in Kuala Lumpur is that they will no longer sell hard liquor on their premises,\u201d he said, adding that in some states, the annual liquor licence fee was as high as RM5,000.\n\nFSGMAM has some 4,000 members nationwide with about 10,000 sundry shops. In Kuala Lumpur, there is slightly over 1,000 members. However, less than 20% sell hard liquor.\n\nDBKL started clamping down on the sale of liquor last June when Annuar called on it to stop issuing liquor licences.\n\nThe move was reportedly aimed at curbing cases of drink-driving but it had not gone down well with stakeholders who were not consulted about it.\n\nBased on DBKL\u2019s records, 2,400 liquor licences have been issued so far and the Excise Licensing Board of the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur (ELBKL) was looking at processing some 1,100 applications pending since 2019.\n\nA source from City Hall said the excise board would meet with members and Kuala Lumpur mayor Datuk Seri Mahadi Che Ngah soon, and a decision would be made on whether to implement or cancel the regulations.\n\n\u201cFrom what I hear, it\u2019s 50/50 right now, so anything can happen,\u201d added the source.\n\nELBKL chairman Datuk Jason Lau Beng Wei confirmed that a meeting was being planned to discuss the matter.\n\n\u201cFor now I have no comments but please bear with us on this,\u201d he said.", "keyword": ["liquor", "prior", "impose", "blanket", "dbkl", "ban", "hard", "sell", "association", "discussions", "sale", "chinese", "stakeholders", "decision", "shops", "appeal", "members"], "summary": "Effective Oct 1, they will no longer be allowed to sell hard liquor.\nThose who want to buy hard liquor can still do so at liquor shops, pubs, bars, restaurants as well as supermarkets and hypermarkets in shopping complexes.\nSeveral members expressed their disappointment last year when DBKL decided to impose the blanket ban on the sale of hard liquor without holding discussions with stakeholders.\n\u201cWhen you stop legitimate outlets from selling hard liquor, you will only create illegal ones that may very likely thrive.\nHowever, less than 20% sell hard liquor.", "news": "The Star Online", "date": "2021-08-16 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Toyota celebrates 50m Corollas sold worldwide", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWFsYXlzaWFucmVzZXJ2ZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wOC8xNy90b3lvdGEtY2VsZWJyYXRlcy01MG0tY29yb2xsYXMtc29sZC13b3JsZHdpZGUv0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVtYWxheXNpYW5yZXNlcnZlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA4LzE3L3RveW90YS1jZWxlYnJhdGVzLTUwbS1jb3JvbGxhcy1zb2xkLXdvcmxkd2lkZS9hbXAv?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://themalaysianreserve.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Toyota.jpg", "text": "by BERNAMA / pic by AFP\n\nKUALA LUMPUR \u2013 Japanese carmaker Toyota has sold 50 million units of its Corolla model worldwide with 300,000 sold in the Malaysian market to date.\n\nPresident of UMW Toyota Motor Ravindran K said the success of the model was due to it being a new standard of automotive excellence in this class of cars, offering customers a dynamic and advanced sedan with luxurious styling.\n\n\u201cEach generation, right from the very first, has been a contributor in the brand transformation.

For all of us to break the chain, the correct way of using the screening tool is very important.\n\n\u201cThe authenticity of the tool from the correct source is also very important. A false negative result will not help the current situation,\u201d she added.\n\nShe also disclosed that currently 11 types of saliva kits have been approved by Malaysia Ministry of Health.\n\n\u201cSo only purchase the kit approved by the Malaysia Ministry of Health.

This was despite Low not having any official 1MDB positions.\n\nMohd Hazem went on to assert his belief that Najib as the prime minister was part of Low\u2019s \u201cscheme\u201d for 1MDB, also claiming that Najib had allegedly known that 1MDB\u2019s funds had gone missing but that the then prime minister was purportedly putting on a \u201cdrama\u201d by allegedly pretending to enquire about the funds\u2019 status.\n\nMohd Hazem said all this while testifying as the 10th prosecution witness against Najib in the latter\u2019s trial involving more than RM2 billion of 1MDB funds.\n\nUnder cross-examination by Najib\u2019s lawyer Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah, Mohd Hazem agreed that former 1MDB senior management officials Terence Geh and Jasmine Loo were directly under Low\u2019s control and that he knew from the beginning when he became CEO that the duo\u2019s loyalty was only to Low and not to 1MDB. The two officials were supposed to be under Hazem\u2019s supervision as the CEO.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the two 1MDB officials acted solely at Low\u2019s direction and that they were not necessarily acting for the interests of 1MDB, Mohd Hazem said he did not do anything to avoid this situation as he equated Low and Najib together.\n\nShafee: Now I want to confront you with this important question, why didn\u2019t you do anything about it? Why didn\u2019t you at least bring this up to the board of directors?\n\nHazem: I think we go back to what I told before, they are the people of Jho Low, and Jho Low basically is the prime minister.\n\nWhen Shafee asked if he had attempt to clarify if Low was the actual alter ego of the then prime minister Najib, Hazem said he had spoke with 1MDB then chairman Tan Sri Lodin Wok Kamaruddin, 1MDB then director Tan Sri Ismee Ismail and Najib\u2019s then principal private secretary Datuk Azlin Alias. Hazem later said he had done his best to speak to the relevant personnel who have \u201cdirect access\u201d to the prime minister.\n\nHazem claimed that Lodin and the whole 1MDB board already knew that the company was being run by Low.\n\nAsked for what he specifically told Lodin about both Geh and Loo, Hazem said most of their conversations revolved around their \u201cconcerns of Jho Low handling 1MDB\u201d.\n\nHazem said that he had basically told Lodin about 1MDB being in Low\u2019s \u201chands\u201d and expressed concern over Low running or controlling the company, adding that Lodin had also shared the same concerns.\n\nAsked by Shafee, Hazem confirmed that he had never asked or suggested to Lodin for them to confirm with then PM Najib on what is Low\u2019s role and whether Low controlled 1MDB to the exclusion of Hazem as the CEO.\n\nShafee: But you agree the way you described Jho Low controlling the senior management, you were virtually not the CEO?\n\nHazem: Yes.\n\nShafee: Jho Low was running the company through the management?\n\nHazem: Yes, in a way.\n\nHazem confirmed that he did not suggest to Lodin for them to resolve this by checking with then prime minister Najib if this was how the company 1MDB is to operate, and that he did not take any other measures and did not know if Lodin had asked Najib about such issues.\n\nShafee then suggested that Hazem was making presumptions without evidence that \u201cJho Low is the prime minister and the prime minister is Jho Low\u201d and that Low\u2019s directions essentially came from Najib, but Hazem pointed to meetings where both Najib and Low were present regarding 1MDB matters.\n\nHazem specifically cited a November 28, 2013 meeting at Najib\u2019s house at Jalan Langgak Duta attended by 1MDB officials and BSI Singapore representative Yak Yew Chee, where Low was present and had started the meeting by briefing about 1MDB matters such as 1MDB\u2019s US$2.3 billion funds that were purportedly invested overseas under the custody of BSI Bank and what BSI Bank had told 1MDB auditor KPMG about the funds.\n\nWhen asked how the November 2013 meeting showed that directives from Low to 1MDB management are what Najib has directed, Hazem replied: \u201cThis is with regards to 1MDB, why would Jho Low need to be there?\u201d\n\nHazem later also pointed out that Low was an \u201cexternal party\u201d and had attending the meeting at the prime minister\u2019s house on 1MDB matters, saying that this was evidence that Low was representing Najib\u2019s interests: \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that he (Low) shouldn\u2019t be there at all. He was there and accepted in the meeting.\u201d\n\nHazem confirmed that he had never asked Najib on what Low\u2019s role was and how he was supposed to react as CEO.\n\nHazem had previously described Low as Najib\u2019s trusted right-hand man, proxy and special adviser for 1MDB.\n\nAbout the bonus\n\nShafee: You said truly you were not a CEO.\n\nHazem: Yes.\n\nShafee: You were virtually led by the nose with the greatest respect?\n\nHazem: Yes.\n\nHazem agreed with Shafee that he was concerned and ashamed at having being reduced to being impotent as a CEO and that this affected his pride, adding that he had very little control or no control over the matter.\n\nShafee then repeatedly grilled Hazem about the decision in a 1MDB board meeting on April 22, 2014 \u2014 which Hazem had excused himself from \u2014 to give him a bonus after the 1MDB remuneration committee assessed his performance as having \u201cexceeded expectations\u201d.\n\nShafee repeatedly questioned whether Hazem had felt ashamed for receiving a bonus on top of his monthly salary of more than RM90,000 when the company was allegedly going down the drain and when his pride was affected as he was led by the nose as a CEO.\n\nDeputy public prosecutor Akram Ahmad Gharib then said such questions were not relevant to the charges that Najib was facing and that Hazem had already answered that it was a decision made by the 1MDB board.\n\nShafee explained that he was trying to challenge Hazem\u2019s credibility: \u201cI\u2019m trying to show the inconsistent answers he has provided, namely on one hand he said he felt ashamed, his pride is affected because as a CEO he was completely not CEO, Jho Low was CEO, so he was not doing any work, he was just taking orders virtually, so if your pride is affected, naturally the question is why do you receive so much bonus and how do you feel?\u201d\n\nHazem later said he was not ashamed to have received his salary and bonus worth a combined RM2.9 million for the entire year of 2014 as he had done his job as required to meet targets set by the 1MDB board.\n\nHazem disagreed with Shafee\u2019s suggestion that he was purportedly shameless in receiving the salary and bonus as he was part of a purported conspiracy with Low to hoodwink 1MDB.\n\nWas it a \u2018drama\u2019?\n\nShafee highlighted the November 28, 2013 meeting at Najib\u2019s house and another meeting where Hazem was subsequently recorded as informing KPMG on another day that BSI Bank\u2019s Yak had assured the prime minister that 1MDB\u2019s US$2.3 billion investment was intact.\n\nHazem said he did not know for a fact at that point that the funds had disappeared, but had suspected that the funds \u201cprobably have disappeared\u201d.\n\nShafee then questioned why Hazem had not asked to speak privately to then prime minister Najib and share his suspicions about 1MDB funds to help save the company and the country, with Hazem then saying he believed Najib already knew the funds were gone.\n\nHazem: Because as far as I\u2019m concerned, the prime minister knows it, he is part of the scheme.\n\nShafee: The prime minister knows the money disappeared?\n\nHazem: From the very beginning I told you, the presence of Jho Low is the prime minister, that was what I was told.\n\nHazem however agreed he had never confirmed if Low was \u201ctruly the PM\u201d and agreed that he was making a presumption that Najib already knew the 1MDB funds were missing.\n\nShafee: Do you think Datuk Seri Najib, at that meeting, do you think Datuk Seri Najib when he asked for the assurance of the funds, he was being briefed about the funds, all those meetings, are you saying Datuk Seri Najib was pretending to ask all these questions because he knows the money disappeared?\n\nHazem: I won\u2019t answer on his behalf.\n\nShafee: I\u2019m asking you, are you saying Datuk Seri Najib when he was being briefed about the funds, it was all a drama by Datuk Seri Najib?\n\nHazem: Yes.\n\nHazem later disagreed with Shafee\u2019s suggestion that it was not Najib trying to put on a drama about the 1MDB funds, and disagreed that it was Hazem, Yak and Low trying to put on the alleged drama to impress Najib and 1MDB board members.\n\nNajib\u2019s 1MDB trial before High Court judge Collin Lawrence Sequerah resumes tomorrow morning. \u2014 Malay Mail", "keyword": ["low",

Not least because, in essence, there was nothing innovative about it.\n\nIn the 1970s, Apple, Atari and Commodore were already producing computer models. But the strength of the IBM PC lay mainly in its ability to outsource the production of its components to other companies.\n\nAs soon as it was released, the company decided to publish the design and software code of the model, allowing other players in the sector to design compatible products.\n\nIn the IBM PC, the processor was an Intel 8088, the floppy drive was from Tandon, and the operating system was Microsoft\u2019s QDOS. IBM, on the other hand, supplied only the monitor, keyboard, and system unit.\n\nLittle by little, the personal computer became more commonplace in homes, whereas its predecessors had failed to earn mass acceptance.\n\nAnd in 1983, Time magazine awarded it the prize for machine of the year, even though the award is generally used to celebrate people.\n\nBacklash to the rapid success\n\nBut the price of fame turned out to be higher than expected. Indeed, in order to be competitive and put out a large quantity, IBM assembled the 5150 prototype in a hurry, without much verification afterwards.\n\nMeanwhile, Bill Gates\u2019s Microsoft, a newcomer to the operating system market, had set about establishing a dominant position.\n\nOther companies, such as Compaq, Dell or HP, were also starting to manufacture personal computers, more or less legally with respect to IBM.\n\nWithin a short time, competitors took over the PC market. In 2005, IBM sold its PC production business to Lenovo for US$1.3 billion.

But until then, he had a chance to form a government.\n\nDodging The Bullet\n\nAzhar Azizan Harun.\n\nAlmost immediately there were reports of the 14th Parliamentary Assembly sitting being postponed to May 18. It then became a single day sitting to hear the speech by the Yang di-Pertuan. There. There will be no meeting.\n\nDue to the Covid-19 dangers at the time, a Parliamentary meeting was set for 13 July instead. It was during this meeting that Mahiaddin flexed his support by narrowly clearing a major political test to remove the lower house speaker.\n\nDatuk Azhar Azizan Harun was installed as Dewan Rakyat Speaker after a lunch break without a vote from MPs. The move brought ire from the opposition.\n\nAll motions for a confidence vote were unlikely to happen.\n\nThe Third Wave\n\nElement5 Digital / Unsplash\n\nCovid-19 cases in Malaysia were low. The country was considered one of the best countries in the world to have handled the pandemic. It sustained the people\u2019s confidence in Mahiaddin. But then, a misstep\u2026\n\nThe Sabah state election (26 September to 12 October 2020) resulted in a third wave of Covid-19 cases as people from across the country went there to campaign and then returned home.\n\nAfterwards, the government scrambled to contain the outbreak by imposing a conditional movement order in Sabah and selected states.\n\nThe Hail Mary\n\nAs the number of cases increased, Mahiaddin\u2019s popularity waned. Nothing he did, from the ever-changing MCO and National Recovery Plan to Financial Assistance and SOPs, seemed to work.\n\nAll the while Mahiaddin was operating as the Prime Minister without a deputy. Some speculated that it was done to prevent votes for him from splintering.\n\nThat changed this year (2021) on 7 July when he named Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob as his deputy and Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein as a Senior Minister. A move, some say, was done to placate UMNO and for Mahiaddin to retain a majority.\n\nThe Fumble\n\nParliament, 26 July 2021\n\nOn 26 July 2021, Parliament and Law Minister Datuk Seri Takiyuddin Hassan, stated that Emergency Ordinances, which had been in place since 11 January, were retracted on 21 July.\n\nThe statement was then rebuked by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong who holds the Constitutional right to enact and repeal the Emergency Ordinance.\n\nThe issue fractured Mahiaddin\u2019s already fragile alliance. Because of it, two Ministers and about a dozen MPs pulled their support for the Prime Minister and the opposition challenged his majority.\n\nOn 13 August, Mahiaddin extended an olive branch to the opposition. He promised a General Election, a cross-party framework, and additional funds. But, it did not work. Some even looked at it as a bribe.\n\nToday (16 August), after less than two years, Mahiaddin has resigned his position as Prime Minister.\n\nLet us know on TRP\u2019s Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram!", "keyword": ["months", "malaysias", "17", "8th", "resigned", "installed", "agong", "cases", "mahiaddin", "minister", "prime", "dipertuan", "parliament", "election", "political", "vote"], "summary": "Tan Sri Mahiaddin Md Yasin, also known as Muhyiddin Yassin, had the unenviable task of being the Prime Minister of Malaysia during an unprecedented global pandemic.\nWe have covered his political journey up to when he became the Prime Minister on 29 February 2020.\nThe statement was then rebuked by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong who holds the Constitutional right to enact and repeal the Emergency Ordinance.\nBecause of it, two Ministers and about a dozen MPs pulled their support for the Prime Minister and the opposition challenged his majority.\nToday (16 August), after less than two years, Mahiaddin has resigned his position as Prime Minister.", "news": "The Rakyat Post", "date": "2021-08-16 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Buy And Sell Artisanal Goods On This Uniquely Malaysian e-Commerce Platform", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL2xpdmluZy8yMDIxLzA4LzE4L2J1eS1hbmQtc2VsbC1hcnRpc2FuYWwtZ29vZHMtb24tdGhpcy11bmlxdWVseS1tYWxheXNpYW4tZS1jb21tZXJjZS1wbGF0Zm9ybS_SAYABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlcmFreWF0cG9zdC5jb20vbGl2aW5nLzIwMjEvMDgvMTgvYnV5LWFuZC1zZWxsLWFydGlzYW5hbC1nb29kcy1vbi10aGlzLXVuaXF1ZWx5LW1hbGF5c2lhbi1lLWNvbW1lcmNlLXBsYXRmb3JtL2FtcC8?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Maya Suraya", "Azizul Rahman Ismail"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/TAHFI1.jpg", "text": "Subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates.\n\nThe Artisans Haven (TAH) is an online platform that showcases talented Malaysian artisans and their handmade products.\n\nFirst formed in September 2020, TAH was created as an answer to individuals who suddenly lost their jobs due to Covid-19 and had turned to the handmade artisan sector as a financial lifeline.\n\nAccording to Rosalie Lin, Brand & PR Advisory and co-Founder of TAH, what makes their platform different from other e-Commerce sites is how dedicated the team are to tell the story behind particular products and the sellers behind them.\n\nAnother distinctive feature is also how nothing is ever the same on the platform as most things are handmade, and can be customised to your preference \u2013 like a painting of your pet.\n\nA boost in confidence\n\nJade Lee, CEO and Co-Founder of TAH has made it the company\u2019s mission to boost the confidence of local artisans and micro-entrepreneurs.\n\nOne such entrepreneur is Aesos Lai, who used to run a souvenir gift shop and durian-centric caf\u00e9 at tourist hot spot Central Market.

Thus, he urged the government to manage the sales and distribution of self-test kits efficiently via subsidisation or price control mechanisms, and immediately curb and end sales of fake kits as well as sales by unqualified sellers.\n\n\n\nIn view of potential price control mechanisms, MPS suggested that the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) give a one-month grace period

must ensure price controls include not only standardisation of the sales price but also control of the cost price from the supplier,\u201d Amrahi noted.\n\nHe said this is because MPS has received numerous complaints from the public and pharmacists that self-test kits are being sold online and via WhatsApp at extremely low prices and with no guarantee of the product being genuine.\n\nAs KPDNHEP

These expanded measures will take effect today (16 August 2021).\n\n\u201cThe government understands that many personal activities have been disrupted as a result of this pandemic. This includes buying household items and doing basic upkeep like haircuts. The government is aware, the longer this is restricted, the greater the risk to the mental and physical health of the people,\u201d PM Muhyiddin said.\n\nThe government also sees that, he added, it is very important for economic sectors to reopen in stages because if the situation persists, the impact especially on business owners and their employees will be worse.\n\nThe latest series of updates are explained in detail below, and cover the following:\n\nThe 11 more sectors allowed to operate in Phase One of National Recovery Plan\n\nThe additional 11 sectors allowed to operate in Phase Two of National Recovery Plan\n\nManufacturing, construction, mining, and quarrying activities to resume, based on percentage of fully-vaccinated workforce\n\nVisiting parks for exercising and for recreational activities to be allowed (for individual activities only)\n\nPlans for travel bubble to pilot with Langkawi Island\n\nScroll below for the updates.\n\nUpdates to Phase One of National Recovery Plan\n\nIn that regard, for states under Phase One of NRP, there are 11 business sectors that are allowed to operate, effective 16 August 2021. They are:\n\nCar wash; Electrical and electronics stores; Household goods and kitchen utensils; Furniture stores; Sports equipment stores; Car accessories stores; Car distribution and sales centre; Morning and farmers\u2019 markets; Clothing, fashion, and accessories stores; Jewellery stores, and Hairdressers and beauty salons (for basic barber services only).\n\nThis decision came after the government assessed the pandemic situation with the risk assessment data conducted by the Ministry of Health Malaysia (MOH), Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) and \u201cafter discussing with all stakeholders in the sectors of interest\u201d.\n\nThe Prime Minister also noted that for clothing, fashion, and accessory stores; jewellery stores; as well as barbershops and beauty salons, there are additional health SOPs that must be adhered to.\n\n\u201cThis includes wearing gloves, limiting business time between employees and customers and not allowing the use of fitting rooms. These SOPs may be complicated but they are for the safety of employees and customers.\n\n\u201cOwners of premises listed in the business that can re-operate must also ensure that customers who enter the premises must show a COVID-19 digital vaccination certificate to prove that the individual has received a complete vaccination,\u201d PM Muhyiddin said.\n\nUpdates to Phase Two of National Recovery Plan\n\nFor states in Phase Two of NRP, an additional 11 business sectors will be allowed to operate (over and above those listed in Phase One), effective 16 August 2021. They are:\n\nPhotographic goods store and photographic services; Second-hand items; Florists and nurseries; Handicraft and souvenir stores; Antique stores; Toy stores; Carpet stores; Creative content and creative industry equipment stores; Outdoor equipment stores (including camping, fishing and other equipment); Cosmetics, skin care, and perfume stores, and Tobacco stores (including vape and electronic cigarettes).\n\n\u201cOwners of premises listed have to ensure that customers who enter the premises must show a COVID-19 digital vaccination certificate to prove that the individual has received a complete vaccination,\u201d the Prime Minister reiterated.\n\nManufacturing, construction, mining, and quarrying activities to resume\n\n\u201cI would also like to inform that the government has agreed to allow all non-essential activities in the manufacturing, construction, mining and quarrying sectors to resume operations from 16 August 2021 in states that are under Phase One, Two, and Three of NRP.\n\n\u201cHowever, the operating capacity depends on the rate of complete vaccination of the workers,\u201d PM Muhyiddin said.\n\nThis translates into the following:\n\nShould the manufacturing, construction, mining and quarrying business have 80% to 100% of employees fully-vaccinated, then they are allowed to operate with 100% capacity.\n\nSimilarly, for 60% to 79% of employees fully-vaccinated, then operating capacity is at 80%;\n\nFinally, for 40% to 59% of fully-vaccinated workforce, then operating capacity is at 60%.\n\nFurther, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) reminded that companies are required to declare the number and names of their fully-vaccinated employees in the COVID-19 Intelligent Management System (CIMS) 3.0 system.\n\nUpon declaration, the company may directly download the latest approval letter from the system to operate.\n\nThe government understands, PM Muhyiddin noted, this decision will provoke various reactions from the public who are concerned about the risk of contagion. He reassured that this decision is \u201cmade with care\u201d, and that it is necessary because \u201cmany employers began to reduce the workforce, causing many to lose their jobs\u201d - and the government cannot allow this situation to continue.\n\nPM Muhyiddin added: \u201cI would like to remind all employers to comply with and meet the conditions that have been set before resuming operations to ensure the safety of employees and secure work. At the same time, take full advantage of the wage subsidy initiatives provided by the Government to ensure that every employee receives their salary payment.\u201d\n\nVisiting parks for exercising and for recreational activities\n\nBeyond the economic aspect of Malaysia, the Prime Minister also announced more measures to boost the nation\u2019s mental wellbeing. This is by allowing locals in states under Phase One of NRP to visit parks for exercising and for recreational activities.\n\n\u201cBut remember, only activities that can be done individually such as jogging, cycling and exercising are allowed, in line with the sports and leisure SOPs in Phase One of NRP,\u201d PM Muhyiddin said.\n\nHe added that the public is also only allowed to visit public recreational parks in the neighbourhood; not to cross states, or regions to go to other recreational parks. Local authorities and agencies will monitor the situation, and ensure that health SOPs are adhered to.\n\nPlans for travel bubble to pilot with Langkawi Island\n\nIn his speech, PM Muhyiddin also spoke of the government\u2019s plans to implement a travel bubble at Langkawi Island. This will be a pilot project for the fully-vaccinated, and will be crucial to \u201crevive the tourism industry.\u201d\n\nHe shared that the Ministry of Health (MOH) and health experts have advised the government to implement this plan only when the complete vaccination rate of the population of Langkawi Island reaches at least 80% of the total population.\n\nAs of 15 August 2021, however, according to the COVID-19 Vaccine Supply Assurance Special Committee (Jawatankuasa Khas Jaminan Akses Bekalan Vaksin COVID-19/JKJAV), the nation\u2019s vaccination rate is at 45.9% (with two doses) and at 72.9% (with one dose).\n\nApart from Langkawi Island, PM Muhyiddin said, the government also has plans to implement a tourism bubble approach in more destinations, other than Langkawi Island, throughout the country.\n\n\u201cHowever, this matter is still at the planning stage and the government will look at the results of the pilot project (Langkawi Island) first. If all goes well, the tourism bubble will be implemented more widely,\u201d the Prime Minister added.\n\nAlso read: SOPs for fully-vaccinated individuals in Malaysia: Phases 1, 2 and 3 of NRP [Aug

self-test kits and wrong use of these kits would produce inaccurate results such as false negatives that would not help in combating the pandemic.\n\n\"Furthermore, with more cases of BID, the government needs to act immediately before the situation worsens,\" he said in a statement on Thursday (Aug 19).\n\nHe added that ideally, self-test kits should be provided free to the public, but if the government is not able to do so, a mechanism to subsidise the cost should be put into place.\n\nThus, MPS is urging the government to manage the sales and distribution of self-test kits efficiently via subsidisation or price control mechanisms, and immediately curb and end sales of fake kits, as well as sales by unqualified sellers.\n\nIn view of potential price control mechanisms, MPS advised the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry to give a grace period of one month before implementation as the move would assist pharmacists who have already purchased the self-test kits at a higher cost to clear the more expensive stock.\n\n\"In the event a grace period is not granted, MPS wants a subsidy or refund mechanism to be put in place to avoid losses to pharmacists who purchased the stocks in good faith.\n\n\"In ensuring price controls benefit the public, the ministry must ensure price controls include not only standardisation of the sales price, but also control of the cost price from the supplier,\" he said.\n\nThis is because MPS has received numerous complaints from the public and from pharmacists of self-test kits being sold online and via WhatsApp at extremely low prices, and with no guarantee of the product being genuine.\n\nAs the ministry only has a general complaints page at https://eaduan.kpdnhep.gov.my/, MPS also suggested that a dedicated page be set up to enable complaints against fake products and sales by non-pharmacists and non-doctors.\n\n\"This would enable turnover of complaints to be handled quickly and efficiently by the ministry's enforcement arm,\" said Amrahi.\n\nHe added that it is critical that a mechanism to identify fake and genuine stock of self-test kits be implemented to further protect the public and suppliers of self-test kits, the ministry and the Malaysian Device Authority (MDA) should work on it immediately.\n\n\"In addition to all the above, the ministry should also help enforce the MDA's policy for conditional approval that allows only licensed pharmacies and healthcare facilities to sell self-test kits online with a proactive approach in barring runners and unqualified sellers from selling self-test kits, as they don\u2019t conform to MDA\u2019s prerequisites of stock-keeping and information sharing with customers,\" he said.", "keyword": ["pharmacists", "kits", "regulation",

David Marshel said DBKL was not looking at the big picture of the issue.\n\n\u201cDBKL should go after the stores that sell illegal and cheap liquor,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen you stop legitimate outlets from selling hard liquor, you will only create illegal ones that may very likely thrive.\n\n\u201cIllegal liquor is bottled to look like the genuine ones. They are sold in the black market.\u201d\n\nMarshel said instead of going after Chinese medicine halls and convenience stores, DBKL should ban the sale of hard liquor at sundry shops, which he said was easily accessible to youths, especially schoolchildren.\n\nAccepting the ruling\n\nMeanwhile the Kuala Lumpur chapter of Federation of Sundry Goods Merchants Association of Malaysia (FSGMAM) has decided not to appeal against DBKL\u2019s new liquor regulations.\n\n\n\nHong says FSGMAM will not appeal against DBKL\u2019s new hard liquor regulations once it comes into force.Its president Hong Chee Meng said the association found the multiple licences that they had to apply from various government agencies like DBKL as well as Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP), too cumbersome.\n\n\u201cRed tape aside, it is also expensive to renew the licence fees annually,\u201d Hong said.\n\n\u201cMany feel that the numerous checks by enforcement authorities such as DBKL, KPDNHEP, the police and Customs were taking its toll.\n\n\u201cThe general feedback from our members in Kuala Lumpur is that they will no longer sell hard liquor on their premises,\u201d he said, adding that in some states, the annual liquor licence fee was as high as RM5,000.\n\nFSGMAM has some 4,000 members nationwide with about 10,000 sundry shops. In Kuala Lumpur, there is slightly over 1,000 members. However, less than 20% sell hard liquor.\n\nDBKL started clamping down on the sale of liquor last June when Annuar called on it to stop issuing liquor licences.\n\nThe move was reportedly aimed at curbing cases of drink-driving but it had not gone down well with stakeholders who were not consulted about it.\n\nBased on DBKL\u2019s records, 2,400 liquor licences have been issued so far and the Excise Licensing Board of the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur (ELBKL) was looking at processing some 1,100 applications pending since 2019.\n\nA source from City Hall said the excise board would meet with members and Kuala Lumpur mayor Datuk Seri Mahadi Che Ngah soon, and a decision would be made on whether to implement or cancel the regulations.\n\n\u201cFrom what I hear, it\u2019s 50/50 right now, so anything can happen,\u201d added the source.\n\nELBKL chairman Datuk Jason Lau Beng Wei confirmed that a meeting was being planned to discuss the matter.\n\n\u201cFor now I have no comments but please bear with us on this,\u201d he said.", "keyword": ["liquor", "prior", "impose", "blanket", "dbkl", "ban", "hard", "sell", "association", "discussions", "sale", "chinese", "stakeholders", "decision", "shops", "appeal", "members"], "summary": "Effective Oct 1, they will no longer be allowed to sell hard liquor.\nThose who want to buy hard liquor can still do so at liquor shops, pubs, bars, restaurants as well as supermarkets and hypermarkets in shopping complexes.\nSeveral members expressed their disappointment last year when DBKL decided to impose the blanket ban on the sale of hard liquor without holding discussions with stakeholders.\n\u201cWhen you stop legitimate outlets from selling hard liquor, you will only create illegal ones that may very likely thrive.\nHowever, less than 20% sell hard liquor.", "news": "The Star Online", "date": "2021-08-16 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Toyota celebrates 50m Corollas sold worldwide", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWFsYXlzaWFucmVzZXJ2ZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wOC8xNy90b3lvdGEtY2VsZWJyYXRlcy01MG0tY29yb2xsYXMtc29sZC13b3JsZHdpZGUv0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVtYWxheXNpYW5yZXNlcnZlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA4LzE3L3RveW90YS1jZWxlYnJhdGVzLTUwbS1jb3JvbGxhcy1zb2xkLXdvcmxkd2lkZS9hbXAv?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://themalaysianreserve.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Toyota.jpg", "text": "by BERNAMA / pic by AFP\n\nKUALA LUMPUR \u2013 Japanese carmaker Toyota has sold 50 million units of its Corolla model worldwide with 300,000 sold in the Malaysian market to date.\n\nPresident of UMW Toyota Motor Ravindran K said the success of the model was due to it being a new standard of automotive excellence in this class of cars, offering customers a dynamic and advanced sedan with luxurious styling.\n\n\u201cEach generation, right from the very first, has been a contributor in the brand transformation.

This was despite Low not having any official 1MDB positions.\n\nMohd Hazem went on to assert his belief that Najib as the prime minister was part of Low\u2019s \u201cscheme\u201d for 1MDB, also claiming that Najib had allegedly known that 1MDB\u2019s funds had gone missing but that the then prime minister was purportedly putting on a \u201cdrama\u201d by allegedly pretending to enquire about the funds\u2019 status.\n\nMohd Hazem said all this while testifying as the 10th prosecution witness against Najib in the latter\u2019s trial involving more than RM2 billion of 1MDB funds.\n\nUnder cross-examination by Najib\u2019s lawyer Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah, Mohd Hazem agreed that former 1MDB senior management officials Terence Geh and Jasmine Loo were directly under Low\u2019s control and that he knew from the beginning when he became CEO that the duo\u2019s loyalty was only to Low and not to 1MDB. The two officials were supposed to be under Hazem\u2019s supervision as the CEO.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the two 1MDB officials acted solely at Low\u2019s direction and that they were not necessarily acting for the interests of 1MDB, Mohd Hazem said he did not do anything to avoid this situation as he equated Low and Najib together.\n\nShafee: Now I want to confront you with this important question, why didn\u2019t you do anything about it? Why didn\u2019t you at least bring this up to the board of directors?\n\nHazem: I think we go back to what I told before, they are the people of Jho Low, and Jho Low basically is the prime minister.\n\nWhen Shafee asked if he had attempt to clarify if Low was the actual alter ego of the then prime minister Najib, Hazem said he had spoke with 1MDB then chairman Tan Sri Lodin Wok Kamaruddin, 1MDB then director Tan Sri Ismee Ismail and Najib\u2019s then principal private secretary Datuk Azlin Alias. Hazem later said he had done his best to speak to the relevant personnel who have \u201cdirect access\u201d to the prime minister.\n\nHazem claimed that Lodin and the whole 1MDB board already knew that the company was being run by Low.\n\nAsked for what he specifically told Lodin about both Geh and Loo, Hazem said most of their conversations revolved around their \u201cconcerns of Jho Low handling 1MDB\u201d.\n\nHazem said that he had basically told Lodin about 1MDB being in Low\u2019s \u201chands\u201d and expressed concern over Low running or controlling the company, adding that Lodin had also shared the same concerns.\n\nAsked by Shafee, Hazem confirmed that he had never asked or suggested to Lodin for them to confirm with then PM Najib on what is Low\u2019s role and whether Low controlled 1MDB to the exclusion of Hazem as the CEO.\n\nShafee: But you agree the way you described Jho Low controlling the senior management, you were virtually not the CEO?\n\nHazem: Yes.\n\nShafee: Jho Low was running the company through the management?\n\nHazem: Yes, in a way.\n\nHazem confirmed that he did not suggest to Lodin for them to resolve this by checking with then prime minister Najib if this was how the company 1MDB is to operate, and that he did not take any other measures and did not know if Lodin had asked Najib about such issues.\n\nShafee then suggested that Hazem was making presumptions without evidence that \u201cJho Low is the prime minister and the prime minister is Jho Low\u201d and that Low\u2019s directions essentially came from Najib, but Hazem pointed to meetings where both Najib and Low were present regarding 1MDB matters.\n\nHazem specifically cited a November 28, 2013 meeting at Najib\u2019s house at Jalan Langgak Duta attended by 1MDB officials and BSI Singapore representative Yak Yew Chee, where Low was present and had started the meeting by briefing about 1MDB matters such as 1MDB\u2019s US$2.3 billion funds that were purportedly invested overseas under the custody of BSI Bank and what BSI Bank had told 1MDB auditor KPMG about the funds.\n\nWhen asked how the November 2013 meeting showed that directives from Low to 1MDB management are what Najib has directed, Hazem replied: \u201cThis is with regards to 1MDB, why would Jho Low need to be there?\u201d\n\nHazem later also pointed out that Low was an \u201cexternal party\u201d and had attending the meeting at the prime minister\u2019s house on 1MDB matters, saying that this was evidence that Low was representing Najib\u2019s interests: \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that he (Low) shouldn\u2019t be there at all. He was there and accepted in the meeting.\u201d\n\nHazem confirmed that he had never asked Najib on what Low\u2019s role was and how he was supposed to react as CEO.\n\nHazem had previously described Low as Najib\u2019s trusted right-hand man, proxy and special adviser for 1MDB.\n\nAbout the bonus\n\nShafee: You said truly you were not a CEO.\n\nHazem: Yes.\n\nShafee: You were virtually led by the nose with the greatest respect?\n\nHazem: Yes.\n\nHazem agreed with Shafee that he was concerned and ashamed at having being reduced to being impotent as a CEO and that this affected his pride, adding that he had very little control or no control over the matter.\n\nShafee then repeatedly grilled Hazem about the decision in a 1MDB board meeting on April 22, 2014 \u2014 which Hazem had excused himself from \u2014 to give him a bonus after the 1MDB remuneration committee assessed his performance as having \u201cexceeded expectations\u201d.\n\nShafee repeatedly questioned whether Hazem had felt ashamed for receiving a bonus on top of his monthly salary of more than RM90,000 when the company was allegedly going down the drain and when his pride was affected as he was led by the nose as a CEO.\n\nDeputy public prosecutor Akram Ahmad Gharib then said such questions were not relevant to the charges that Najib was facing and that Hazem had already answered that it was a decision made by the 1MDB board.\n\nShafee explained that he was trying to challenge Hazem\u2019s credibility: \u201cI\u2019m trying to show the inconsistent answers he has provided, namely on one hand he said he felt ashamed, his pride is affected because as a CEO he was completely not CEO, Jho Low was CEO, so he was not doing any work, he was just taking orders virtually, so if your pride is affected, naturally the question is why do you receive so much bonus and how do you feel?\u201d\n\nHazem later said he was not ashamed to have received his salary and bonus worth a combined RM2.9 million for the entire year of 2014 as he had done his job as required to meet targets set by the 1MDB board.\n\nHazem disagreed with Shafee\u2019s suggestion that he was purportedly shameless in receiving the salary and bonus as he was part of a purported conspiracy with Low to hoodwink 1MDB.\n\nWas it a \u2018drama\u2019?\n\nShafee highlighted the November 28, 2013 meeting at Najib\u2019s house and another meeting where Hazem was subsequently recorded as informing KPMG on another day that BSI Bank\u2019s Yak had assured the prime minister that 1MDB\u2019s US$2.3 billion investment was intact.\n\nHazem said he did not know for a fact at that point that the funds had disappeared, but had suspected that the funds \u201cprobably have disappeared\u201d.\n\nShafee then questioned why Hazem had not asked to speak privately to then prime minister Najib and share his suspicions about 1MDB funds to help save the company and the country, with Hazem then saying he believed Najib already knew the funds were gone.\n\nHazem: Because as far as I\u2019m concerned, the prime minister knows it, he is part of the scheme.\n\nShafee: The prime minister knows the money disappeared?\n\nHazem: From the very beginning I told you, the presence of Jho Low is the prime minister, that was what I was told.\n\nHazem however agreed he had never confirmed if Low was \u201ctruly the PM\u201d and agreed that he was making a presumption that Najib already knew the 1MDB funds were missing.\n\nShafee: Do you think Datuk Seri Najib, at that meeting, do you think Datuk Seri Najib when he asked for the assurance of the funds, he was being briefed about the funds, all those meetings, are you saying Datuk Seri Najib was pretending to ask all these questions because he knows the money disappeared?\n\nHazem: I won\u2019t answer on his behalf.\n\nShafee: I\u2019m asking you, are you saying Datuk Seri Najib when he was being briefed about the funds, it was all a drama by Datuk Seri Najib?\n\nHazem: Yes.\n\nHazem later disagreed with Shafee\u2019s suggestion that it was not Najib trying to put on a drama about the 1MDB funds, and disagreed that it was Hazem, Yak and Low trying to put on the alleged drama to impress Najib and 1MDB board members.\n\nNajib\u2019s 1MDB trial before High Court judge Collin Lawrence Sequerah resumes tomorrow morning. \u2014 Malay Mail", "keyword": ["low",

Muhyiddin Yassin (pix) said he had made various efforts till the last minute in a bid to keep the Perikatan Nasional (PN) government intact, at least until it had completed its duty in managing the Covid-19 pandemic and reviving the economy.\n\nHowever, he said his efforts were unsuccessful because certain parties were greedy in trying to grab power without considering its impact on the people\u2019s lives and livelihoods.\n\n\u201cTo me, what has happened is the will of Allah s.w.t. which is an episode in the history of my political struggle,\u201d he said in a special address on local television today.\n\nMuhyiddin said he had tendered his resignation as the prime minister and that of the whole Cabinet to the Yang di-Pertuan Agong in accordance with Article 43(4) of the Federal Constitution because he had lost majority support in the Dewan Rakyat.\n\nMuhyiddin said he had initially proposed to use Parliament to determine his legitimacy as prime minister but decided to resign after 15 Umno Members of Parliament withdrew support for him and the opposition rejected his offer of cross-party cooperation.\n\n\u201cI heard the sincere appeal of millions of Malaysians for me to carry on and not to resign.

IBM, on the other hand, supplied only the monitor, keyboard, and system unit.\n\nLittle by little, the personal computer became more commonplace in homes, whereas its predecessors had failed to earn mass acceptance.\n\nAnd in 1983, Time magazine awarded it the prize for machine of the year, even though the award is generally used to celebrate people.\n\nBacklash to the rapid success\n\nBut the price of fame turned out to be higher than expected. Indeed, in order to be competitive and put out a large quantity, IBM assembled the 5150 prototype in a hurry, without much verification afterwards.\n\nMeanwhile, Bill Gates\u2019s Microsoft, a newcomer to the operating system market, had set about establishing a dominant position.\n\nOther companies, such as Compaq, Dell or HP, were also starting to manufacture personal computers, more or less legally with respect to IBM.\n\nWithin a short time, competitors took over the PC market.

covered his political journey up to when he became the Prime Minister on 29 February 2020.\n\nREAD MORE: The Dark Horse of Malaysian Politics: Muhyiddin Yassin\n\nHowever, let\u2019s take a look at how he got to where he is today and the political scheme of things that have led to him tendering his resignation as the eighth Prime Minister of Malaysia.\n\nWhere The Troubles Began\n\nMahiaddin being sworn in.\n\nAt 72, Mahiaddin was sworn in as Prime Minister by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong on 1 March 2020 after a week of uncertainty following the collapse of Pakatan Harapan government that was led by Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad.\n\nThe Yang di-Pertuan Agong Al-Sultan Abdullah Ri\u2019ayatuddin Al-Mustafa Billah Shah intervened to solve the deadlock by consulting with all Members of Parliament one-by-one in private, before appointing Mahiaddin as the Prime Minister.\n\nAs he was put into the position without a general election or public vote, there was still a chance that Mahiaddin could be replaced when Parliament convened on 9 March 2020. But until then, he had a chance to form a government.\n\nDodging The Bullet\n\nAzhar Azizan Harun.\n\nAlmost immediately there were reports of the 14th Parliamentary Assembly sitting being postponed to May 18. It then became a single day sitting to hear the speech by the Yang di-Pertuan. There. There will be no meeting.\n\nDue to the Covid-19 dangers at the time, a Parliamentary meeting was set for 13 July instead. It was during this meeting that Mahiaddin flexed his support by narrowly clearing a major political test to remove the lower house speaker.\n\nDatuk Azhar Azizan Harun was installed as Dewan Rakyat Speaker after a lunch break without a vote from MPs. The move brought ire from the opposition.\n\nAll motions for a confidence vote were unlikely to happen.\n\nThe Third Wave\n\nElement5 Digital / Unsplash\n\nCovid-19 cases in Malaysia were low. The country was considered one of the best countries in the world to have handled the pandemic. It sustained the people\u2019s confidence in Mahiaddin. But then, a misstep\u2026\n\nThe Sabah state election (26 September to 12 October 2020) resulted in a third wave of Covid-19 cases as people from across the country went there to campaign and then returned home.\n\nAfterwards, the government scrambled to contain the outbreak by imposing a conditional movement order in Sabah and selected states.\n\nThe Hail Mary\n\nAs the number of cases increased, Mahiaddin\u2019s popularity waned. Nothing he did, from the ever-changing MCO and National Recovery Plan to Financial Assistance and SOPs, seemed to work.\n\nAll the while Mahiaddin was operating as the Prime Minister without a deputy. Some speculated that it was done to prevent votes for him from splintering.\n\nThat changed this year (2021) on 7 July when he named Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob as his deputy and Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein as a Senior Minister. A move, some say, was done to placate UMNO and for Mahiaddin to retain a majority.\n\nThe Fumble\n\nParliament, 26 July 2021\n\nOn 26 July 2021, Parliament and Law Minister Datuk Seri Takiyuddin Hassan, stated that Emergency Ordinances, which had been in place since 11 January, were retracted on 21 July.\n\nThe statement was then rebuked by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong who holds the Constitutional right to enact and repeal the Emergency Ordinance.\n\nThe issue fractured Mahiaddin\u2019s already fragile alliance. Because of it, two Ministers and about a dozen MPs pulled their support for the Prime Minister and the opposition challenged his majority.\n\nOn 13 August, Mahiaddin extended an olive branch to the opposition. He promised a General Election, a cross-party framework, and additional funds. But, it did not work. Some even looked at it as a bribe.\n\nToday (16 August), after less than two years, Mahiaddin has resigned his position as Prime Minister.\n\nLet us know on TRP\u2019s Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram!", "keyword": ["months", "malaysias", "17", "8th", "resigned", "installed", "agong", "cases", "mahiaddin", "minister", "prime", "dipertuan", "parliament", "election", "political", "vote"], "summary": "Tan Sri Mahiaddin Md Yasin, also known as Muhyiddin Yassin, had the unenviable task of being the Prime Minister of Malaysia during an unprecedented global pandemic.\nWe have covered his political journey up to when he became the Prime Minister on 29 February 2020.\nThe statement was then rebuked by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong who holds the Constitutional right to enact and repeal the Emergency Ordinance.\nBecause of it, two Ministers and about a dozen MPs pulled their support for the Prime Minister and the opposition challenged his majority.\nToday (16 August), after less than two years, Mahiaddin has resigned his position as Prime Minister.", "news": "The Rakyat Post", "date": "2021-08-16 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Buy And Sell Artisanal Goods On This Uniquely Malaysian e-Commerce Platform", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL2xpdmluZy8yMDIxLzA4LzE4L2J1eS1hbmQtc2VsbC1hcnRpc2FuYWwtZ29vZHMtb24tdGhpcy11bmlxdWVseS1tYWxheXNpYW4tZS1jb21tZXJjZS1wbGF0Zm9ybS_SAYABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlcmFreWF0cG9zdC5jb20vbGl2aW5nLzIwMjEvMDgvMTgvYnV5LWFuZC1zZWxsLWFydGlzYW5hbC1nb29kcy1vbi10aGlzLXVuaXF1ZWx5LW1hbGF5c2lhbi1lLWNvbW1lcmNlLXBsYXRmb3JtL2FtcC8?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Maya Suraya", "Azizul Rahman Ismail"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/TAHFI1.jpg", "text": "Subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates.\n\nThe Artisans Haven (TAH) is an online platform that showcases talented Malaysian artisans and their handmade products.\n\nFirst formed in September 2020, TAH was created as an answer to individuals who suddenly lost their jobs due to Covid-19 and had turned to the handmade artisan sector as a financial lifeline.\n\nAccording to Rosalie Lin, Brand & PR Advisory and co-Founder of TAH, what makes their platform different from other e-Commerce sites is how dedicated the team are to tell the story behind particular products and the sellers behind them.\n\nAnother distinctive feature is also how nothing is ever the same on the platform as most things are handmade, and can be customised to your preference \u2013 like a painting of your pet.\n\nA boost in confidence\n\nJade Lee, CEO and Co-Founder of TAH has made it the company\u2019s mission to boost the confidence of local artisans and micro-entrepreneurs.\n\nOne such entrepreneur is Aesos Lai, who used to run a souvenir gift shop and durian-centric caf\u00e9 at tourist hot spot Central Market.

Thus, he urged the government to manage the sales and distribution of self-test kits efficiently via subsidisation or price control mechanisms, and immediately curb and end sales of fake kits as well as sales by unqualified sellers.\n\n\n\nIn view of potential price control mechanisms, MPS suggested that the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) give a one-month grace period before implementation as the move would assist pharmacists who have already purchased the self-test kits at a higher cost to clear the more expensive stock.\n\n\u201cIn the event a grace period is not granted, MPS wants a subsidy or refund mechanism be put in place to avoid losses to pharmacists who purchased the stocks in good faith.\n\n\u201cIn ensuring price controls benefit the public, KPDNHEP must ensure price controls include not only standardisation of the sales price but also control of the cost price from the supplier,\u201d Amrahi noted.\n\nHe said this is because MPS has received numerous complaints from the public and pharmacists that self-test kits are being sold online and via WhatsApp at extremely low prices and with no guarantee of the product being genuine.\n\nAs KPDNHEP only has a general complaints page, MPS also suggested that a dedicated page be set up to enable complaints against fake products and sales by non-pharmacists and non-doctors.\n\nAmrahi said this would enable turnover of complaints to be handled quickly and efficiently by the KPDNHEP enforcement arm.\n\nHe added that it is critical that a mechanism to identify fake and genuine stock of self-test kits be implemented to further protect the public.\n\n\u201cSuppliers of self-test kits, KPDNHEP and the Malaysian Device Authority (MDA) should work on this immediately,\u201d he stressed.\n\nAdditionally, he said KPDNHEP should also help enforce MDA\u2019s policy for conditional approval that allows only licensed pharmacies and healthcare facilities to sell selftest kits

These expanded measures will take effect today (16 August 2021).\n\n\u201cThe government understands that many personal activities have been disrupted as a result of this pandemic. This includes buying household items and doing basic upkeep like haircuts. The government is aware, the longer this is restricted, the greater the risk to the mental and physical health of the people,\u201d PM Muhyiddin said.\n\nThe government also sees that, he added, it is very important for economic sectors to reopen in stages because if the situation persists, the impact especially on business owners and their employees will be worse.\n\nThe latest series of updates are explained in detail below, and cover the following:\n\nThe 11 more sectors allowed to operate in Phase One of National Recovery Plan\n\nThe additional 11 sectors allowed to operate in Phase Two of National Recovery Plan\n\nManufacturing, construction, mining, and quarrying activities to resume, based on percentage of fully-vaccinated workforce\n\nVisiting parks for exercising and for recreational activities to be allowed (for individual activities only)\n\nPlans for travel bubble to pilot with Langkawi Island\n\nScroll below for the updates.\n\nUpdates to Phase One of National Recovery Plan\n\nIn that regard, for states under Phase One of NRP, there are 11 business sectors that are allowed to operate, effective 16 August 2021. They are:\n\nCar wash; Electrical and electronics stores; Household goods and kitchen utensils; Furniture stores; Sports equipment stores; Car accessories stores; Car distribution and sales centre; Morning and farmers\u2019 markets; Clothing, fashion, and accessories stores; Jewellery stores, and Hairdressers and beauty salons (for basic barber services only).\n\nThis decision came after the government assessed the pandemic situation with the risk assessment data conducted by the Ministry of Health Malaysia (MOH), Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) and \u201cafter discussing with all stakeholders in the sectors of interest\u201d.\n\nThe Prime Minister also noted that for clothing, fashion, and accessory stores; jewellery stores; as well as barbershops and beauty salons, there are additional health SOPs that must be adhered to.\n\n\u201cThis includes wearing gloves, limiting business time between employees and customers and not allowing the use of fitting rooms. These SOPs may be complicated but they are for the safety of employees and customers.\n\n\u201cOwners of premises listed in the business that can re-operate must also ensure that customers who enter the premises must show a COVID-19 digital vaccination certificate to prove that the individual has received a complete vaccination,\u201d PM Muhyiddin said.\n\nUpdates to Phase Two of National Recovery Plan\n\nFor states in Phase Two of NRP, an additional 11 business sectors will be allowed to operate (over and above those listed in Phase One), effective 16 August 2021. They are:\n\nPhotographic goods store and photographic services; Second-hand items; Florists and nurseries; Handicraft and souvenir stores; Antique stores; Toy stores; Carpet stores; Creative content and creative industry equipment stores; Outdoor equipment stores (including camping, fishing and other equipment); Cosmetics, skin care, and perfume stores, and Tobacco stores (including vape and electronic cigarettes).\n\n\u201cOwners of premises listed have to ensure that customers who enter the premises must show a COVID-19 digital vaccination certificate to prove that the individual has received a complete vaccination,\u201d the Prime Minister reiterated.\n\nManufacturing, construction, mining, and quarrying activities to resume\n\n\u201cI would also like to inform that the government has agreed to allow all non-essential activities in the manufacturing, construction, mining and quarrying sectors to resume operations from 16 August 2021 in states that are under Phase One, Two, and Three of NRP.\n\n\u201cHowever, the operating capacity depends on the rate of complete vaccination of the workers,\u201d PM Muhyiddin said.\n\nThis translates into the following:\n\nShould the manufacturing, construction, mining and quarrying business have 80% to 100% of employees fully-vaccinated, then they are allowed to operate with 100% capacity.\n\nSimilarly, for 60% to 79% of employees fully-vaccinated, then operating capacity is at 80%;\n\nFinally, for 40% to 59% of fully-vaccinated workforce, then operating capacity is at 60%.\n\nFurther, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) reminded that companies are required to declare the number and names of their fully-vaccinated employees in the COVID-19 Intelligent Management System (CIMS) 3.0 system.\n\nUpon declaration, the company may directly download the latest approval letter from the system to operate.\n\nThe government understands, PM Muhyiddin noted, this decision will provoke various reactions from the public who are concerned about the risk of contagion. He reassured that this decision is \u201cmade with care\u201d, and that it is necessary because \u201cmany employers began to reduce the workforce, causing many to lose their jobs\u201d - and the government cannot allow this situation to continue.\n\nPM Muhyiddin added: \u201cI would like to remind all employers to comply with and meet the conditions that have been set before resuming operations to ensure the safety of employees and secure work. At the same time, take full advantage of the wage subsidy initiatives provided by the Government to ensure that every employee receives their salary payment.\u201d\n\nVisiting parks for exercising and for recreational activities\n\nBeyond the economic aspect of Malaysia, the Prime Minister also announced more measures to boost the nation\u2019s mental wellbeing. This is by allowing locals in states under Phase One of NRP to visit parks for exercising and for recreational activities.\n\n\u201cBut remember, only activities that can be done individually such as jogging, cycling and exercising are allowed, in line with the sports and leisure SOPs in Phase One of NRP,\u201d PM Muhyiddin said.\n\nHe added that the public is also only allowed to visit public recreational parks in the neighbourhood; not to cross states, or regions to go to other recreational parks. Local authorities and agencies will monitor the situation, and ensure that health SOPs are adhered to.\n\nPlans for travel bubble to pilot with Langkawi Island\n\nIn his speech, PM Muhyiddin also spoke of the government\u2019s plans to implement a travel bubble at Langkawi Island. This will be a pilot project for the fully-vaccinated, and will be crucial to \u201crevive the tourism industry.\u201d\n\nHe shared that the Ministry of Health (MOH) and health experts have advised the government to implement this plan only when the complete vaccination rate of the population of Langkawi Island reaches at least 80% of the total population.\n\nAs of 15 August 2021, however, according to the COVID-19 Vaccine Supply Assurance Special Committee (Jawatankuasa Khas Jaminan Akses Bekalan Vaksin COVID-19/JKJAV), the nation\u2019s vaccination rate is at 45.9% (with two doses) and at 72.9% (with one dose).\n\nApart from Langkawi Island, PM Muhyiddin said, the government also has plans to implement a tourism bubble approach in more destinations, other than Langkawi Island, throughout the country.\n\n\u201cHowever, this matter is still at the planning stage and the government will look at the results of the pilot project (Langkawi Island) first. If all goes well, the tourism bubble will be implemented more widely,\u201d the Prime Minister added.\n\nAlso read: SOPs for fully-vaccinated individuals in Malaysia: Phases 1, 2 and 3 of NRP [Aug

the unregulated sales of Covid-19 self-test kits, especially via WhatsApp and social media, as well as sales by unqualified sellers who are neither pharmacists nor doctors.\n\n\"Fake Covid-19 self-test kits and wrong use of these kits would produce inaccurate results such as false negatives that would not help in combating the pandemic.\n\n\"Furthermore, with more cases of BID, the government needs to act immediately before the situation worsens,\" he said in a statement on Thursday (Aug 19).\n\nHe added that ideally, self-test kits should be provided free to the public, but if the government is not able to do so, a mechanism to subsidise the cost should be put into place.\n\nThus, MPS is urging the government to manage the sales and distribution of self-test kits efficiently via subsidisation or price control mechanisms, and immediately curb and end sales of fake kits, as well as sales by unqualified sellers.\n\nIn view of potential price control mechanisms, MPS advised the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry to give a grace period of one month before implementation as the move would assist pharmacists who have already purchased the self-test kits at a higher cost to clear the more expensive stock.\n\n\"In the event a grace period is not granted, MPS wants a subsidy or refund mechanism to be put in place to avoid losses to pharmacists who purchased the stocks in good faith.\n\n\"In ensuring price controls benefit the public, the ministry must ensure price controls include not only standardisation of the sales price, but also control of the cost price from the supplier,\" he said.\n\nThis is because MPS has received numerous complaints from the public and from pharmacists of self-test kits being sold online and via WhatsApp at extremely low prices, and with no guarantee of the product being genuine.\n\nAs the ministry only has a general complaints page at https://eaduan.kpdnhep.gov.my/, MPS also suggested that a dedicated page be set up to enable complaints against fake products and sales by non-pharmacists and non-doctors.\n\n\"This would enable turnover of complaints to be handled quickly and efficiently by the ministry's enforcement arm,\" said Amrahi.\n\nHe added that it is critical that a mechanism to identify fake and genuine stock of self-test kits be implemented to further protect the public and suppliers of self-test kits, the ministry and the Malaysian Device Authority (MDA) should work on it immediately.\n\n\"In addition to all the above, the ministry should also help enforce the MDA's policy for conditional approval that allows only licensed pharmacies and healthcare facilities to sell self-test kits online with a proactive approach in barring runners and unqualified sellers from selling self-test kits, as they don\u2019t conform to MDA\u2019s prerequisites of stock-keeping and information sharing with customers,\" he said.", "keyword": ["pharmacists", "kits", "regulation",

David Marshel said DBKL was not looking at the big picture of the issue.\n\n\u201cDBKL should go after the stores that sell illegal and cheap liquor,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen you stop legitimate outlets from selling hard liquor, you will only create illegal ones that may very likely thrive.\n\n\u201cIllegal liquor is bottled to look like the genuine ones. They are sold in the black market.\u201d\n\nMarshel said instead of going after Chinese medicine halls and convenience stores, DBKL should ban the sale of hard liquor at sundry shops, which he said was easily accessible to youths, especially schoolchildren.\n\nAccepting the ruling\n\nMeanwhile the Kuala Lumpur chapter of Federation of Sundry Goods Merchants Association of Malaysia (FSGMAM) has decided not to appeal against DBKL\u2019s new liquor regulations.\n\n\n\nHong says FSGMAM will not appeal against DBKL\u2019s new hard liquor regulations once it comes into force.Its president Hong Chee Meng said the association found the multiple licences that they had to apply from various government agencies like DBKL as well as Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP), too cumbersome.\n\n\u201cRed tape aside, it is also expensive to renew the licence fees annually,\u201d Hong said.\n\n\u201cMany feel that the numerous checks by enforcement authorities such as DBKL, KPDNHEP, the police and Customs were taking its toll.\n\n\u201cThe general feedback from our members in Kuala Lumpur is that they will no longer sell hard liquor on their premises,\u201d he said, adding that in some states, the annual liquor licence fee was as high as RM5,000.\n\nFSGMAM has some 4,000 members nationwide with about 10,000 sundry shops. In Kuala Lumpur, there is slightly over 1,000 members. However, less than 20% sell hard liquor.\n\nDBKL started clamping down on the sale of liquor last June when Annuar called on it to stop issuing liquor licences.\n\nThe move was reportedly aimed at curbing cases of drink-driving but it had not gone down well with stakeholders who were not consulted about it.\n\nBased on DBKL\u2019s records, 2,400 liquor licences have been issued so far and the Excise Licensing Board of the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur (ELBKL) was looking at processing some 1,100 applications pending since 2019.\n\nA source from City Hall said the excise board would meet with members and Kuala Lumpur mayor Datuk Seri Mahadi Che Ngah soon, and a decision would be made on whether to implement or cancel the regulations.\n\n\u201cFrom what I hear, it\u2019s 50/50 right now, so anything can happen,\u201d added the source.\n\nELBKL chairman Datuk Jason Lau Beng Wei confirmed that a meeting was being planned to discuss the matter.\n\n\u201cFor now I have no comments but please bear with us on this,\u201d he said.", "keyword": ["liquor", "prior", "impose", "blanket", "dbkl", "ban", "hard", "sell", "association", "discussions", "sale", "chinese", "stakeholders", "decision", "shops", "appeal", "members"], "summary": "Effective Oct 1, they will no longer be allowed to sell hard liquor.\nThose who want to buy hard liquor can still do so at liquor shops, pubs, bars, restaurants as well as supermarkets and hypermarkets in shopping complexes.\nSeveral members expressed their disappointment last year when DBKL decided to impose the blanket ban on the sale of hard liquor without holding discussions with stakeholders.\n\u201cWhen you stop legitimate outlets from selling hard liquor, you will only create illegal ones that may very likely thrive.\nHowever, less than 20% sell hard liquor.", "news": "The Star Online", "date": "2021-08-16 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Toyota celebrates 50m Corollas sold worldwide", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWFsYXlzaWFucmVzZXJ2ZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wOC8xNy90b3lvdGEtY2VsZWJyYXRlcy01MG0tY29yb2xsYXMtc29sZC13b3JsZHdpZGUv0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVtYWxheXNpYW5yZXNlcnZlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA4LzE3L3RveW90YS1jZWxlYnJhdGVzLTUwbS1jb3JvbGxhcy1zb2xkLXdvcmxkd2lkZS9hbXAv?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://themalaysianreserve.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Toyota.jpg", "text": "by BERNAMA / pic by AFP\n\nKUALA LUMPUR \u2013 Japanese carmaker Toyota has sold 50 million units of its Corolla model worldwide with 300,000 sold in the Malaysian market to date.\n\nPresident of UMW Toyota Motor Ravindran K said the success of the model was due to it being a new standard of automotive excellence in this class of cars, offering customers a dynamic and advanced sedan with luxurious styling.\n\n\u201cEach generation, right from the very first, has been a contributor in the brand transformation.

For all of us to break the chain, the correct way of using the screening tool is very important.\n\n\u201cThe authenticity of the tool from the correct source is also very important. A false negative result will not help the current situation,\u201d she added.\n\nShe also disclosed that currently 11 types of saliva kits have been approved by Malaysia Ministry of Health.\n\n\u201cSo only purchase the kit approved by the Malaysia Ministry of Health.

This was despite Low not having any official 1MDB positions.\n\nMohd Hazem went on to assert his belief that Najib as the prime minister was part of Low\u2019s \u201cscheme\u201d for 1MDB, also claiming that Najib had allegedly known that 1MDB\u2019s funds had gone missing but that the then prime minister was purportedly putting on a \u201cdrama\u201d by allegedly pretending to enquire about the funds\u2019 status.\n\nMohd Hazem said all this while testifying as the 10th prosecution witness against Najib in the latter\u2019s trial involving more than RM2 billion of 1MDB funds.\n\nUnder cross-examination by Najib\u2019s lawyer Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah, Mohd Hazem agreed that former 1MDB senior management officials Terence Geh and Jasmine Loo were directly under Low\u2019s control and that he knew from the beginning when he became CEO that the duo\u2019s loyalty was only to Low and not to 1MDB. The two officials were supposed to be under Hazem\u2019s supervision as the CEO.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the two 1MDB officials acted solely at Low\u2019s direction and that they were not necessarily acting for the interests of 1MDB, Mohd Hazem said he did not do anything to avoid this situation as he equated Low and Najib together.\n\nShafee: Now I want to confront you with this important question, why didn\u2019t you do anything about it? Why didn\u2019t you at least bring this up to the board of directors?\n\nHazem: I think we go back to what I told before, they are the people of Jho Low, and Jho Low basically is the prime minister.\n\nWhen Shafee asked if he had attempt to clarify if Low was the actual alter ego of the then prime minister Najib, Hazem said he had spoke with 1MDB then chairman Tan Sri Lodin Wok Kamaruddin, 1MDB then director Tan Sri Ismee Ismail and Najib\u2019s then principal private secretary Datuk Azlin Alias. Hazem later said he had done his best to speak to the relevant personnel who have \u201cdirect access\u201d to the prime minister.\n\nHazem claimed that Lodin and the whole 1MDB board already knew that the company was being run by Low.\n\nAsked for what he specifically told Lodin about both Geh and Loo, Hazem said most of their conversations revolved around their \u201cconcerns of Jho Low handling 1MDB\u201d.\n\nHazem said that he had basically told Lodin about 1MDB being in Low\u2019s \u201chands\u201d and expressed concern over Low running or controlling the company, adding that Lodin had also shared the same concerns.\n\nAsked by Shafee, Hazem confirmed that he had never asked or suggested to Lodin for them to confirm with then PM Najib on what is Low\u2019s role and whether Low controlled 1MDB to the exclusion of Hazem as the CEO.\n\nShafee: But you agree the way you described Jho Low controlling the senior management, you were virtually not the CEO?\n\nHazem: Yes.\n\nShafee: Jho Low was running the company through the management?\n\nHazem: Yes, in a way.\n\nHazem confirmed that he did not suggest to Lodin for them to resolve this by checking with then prime minister Najib if this was how the company 1MDB is to operate, and that he did not take any other measures and did not know if Lodin had asked Najib about such issues.\n\nShafee then suggested that Hazem was making presumptions without evidence that \u201cJho Low is the prime minister and the prime minister is Jho Low\u201d and that Low\u2019s directions essentially came from Najib, but Hazem pointed to meetings where both Najib and Low were present regarding 1MDB matters.\n\nHazem specifically cited a November 28, 2013 meeting at Najib\u2019s house at Jalan Langgak Duta attended by 1MDB officials and BSI Singapore representative Yak Yew Chee, where Low was present and had started the meeting by briefing about 1MDB matters such as 1MDB\u2019s US$2.3 billion funds that were purportedly invested overseas under the custody of BSI Bank and what BSI Bank had told 1MDB auditor KPMG about the funds.\n\nWhen asked how the November 2013 meeting showed that directives from Low to 1MDB management are what Najib has directed, Hazem replied: \u201cThis is with regards to 1MDB, why would Jho Low need to be there?\u201d\n\nHazem later also pointed out that Low was an \u201cexternal party\u201d and had attending the meeting at the prime minister\u2019s house on 1MDB matters, saying that this was evidence that Low was representing Najib\u2019s interests: \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that he (Low) shouldn\u2019t be there at all. He was there and accepted in the meeting.\u201d\n\nHazem confirmed that he had never asked Najib on what Low\u2019s role was and how he was supposed to react as CEO.\n\nHazem had previously described Low as Najib\u2019s trusted right-hand man, proxy and special adviser for 1MDB.\n\nAbout the bonus\n\nShafee: You said truly you were not a CEO.\n\nHazem: Yes.\n\nShafee: You were virtually led by the nose with the greatest respect?\n\nHazem: Yes.\n\nHazem agreed with Shafee that he was concerned and ashamed at having being reduced to being impotent as a CEO and that this affected his pride, adding that he had very little control or no control over the matter.\n\nShafee then repeatedly grilled Hazem about the decision in a 1MDB board meeting on April 22, 2014 \u2014 which Hazem had excused himself from \u2014 to give him a bonus after the 1MDB remuneration committee assessed his performance as having \u201cexceeded expectations\u201d.\n\nShafee repeatedly questioned whether Hazem had felt ashamed for receiving a bonus on top of his monthly salary of more than RM90,000 when the company was allegedly going down the drain and when his pride was affected as he was led by the nose as a CEO.\n\nDeputy public prosecutor Akram Ahmad Gharib then said such questions were not relevant to the charges that Najib was facing and that Hazem had already answered that it was a decision made by the 1MDB board.\n\nShafee explained that he was trying to challenge Hazem\u2019s credibility: \u201cI\u2019m trying to show the inconsistent answers he has provided, namely on one hand he said he felt ashamed, his pride is affected because as a CEO he was completely not CEO, Jho Low was CEO, so he was not doing any work, he was just taking orders virtually, so if your pride is affected, naturally the question is why do you receive so much bonus and how do you feel?\u201d\n\nHazem later said he was not ashamed to have received his salary and bonus worth a combined RM2.9 million for the entire year of 2014 as he had done his job as required to meet targets set by the 1MDB board.\n\nHazem disagreed with Shafee\u2019s suggestion that he was purportedly shameless in receiving the salary and bonus as he was part of a purported conspiracy with Low to hoodwink 1MDB.\n\nWas it a \u2018drama\u2019?\n\nShafee highlighted the November 28, 2013 meeting at Najib\u2019s house and another meeting where Hazem was subsequently recorded as informing KPMG on another day that BSI Bank\u2019s Yak had assured the prime minister that 1MDB\u2019s US$2.3 billion investment was intact.\n\nHazem said he did not know for a fact at that point that the funds had disappeared, but had suspected that the funds \u201cprobably have disappeared\u201d.\n\nShafee then questioned why Hazem had not asked to speak privately to then prime minister Najib and share his suspicions about 1MDB funds to help save the company and the country, with Hazem then saying he believed Najib already knew the funds were gone.\n\nHazem: Because as far as I\u2019m concerned, the prime minister knows it, he is part of the scheme.\n\nShafee: The prime minister knows the money disappeared?\n\nHazem: From the very beginning I told you, the presence of Jho Low is the prime minister, that was what I was told.\n\nHazem however agreed he had never confirmed if Low was \u201ctruly the PM\u201d and agreed that he was making a presumption that Najib already knew the 1MDB funds were missing.\n\nShafee: Do you think Datuk Seri Najib, at that meeting, do you think Datuk Seri Najib when he asked for the assurance of the funds, he was being briefed about the funds, all those meetings, are you saying Datuk Seri Najib was pretending to ask all these questions because he knows the money disappeared?\n\nHazem: I won\u2019t answer on his behalf.\n\nShafee: I\u2019m asking you, are you saying Datuk Seri Najib when he was being briefed about the funds, it was all a drama by Datuk Seri Najib?\n\nHazem: Yes.\n\nHazem later disagreed with Shafee\u2019s suggestion that it was not Najib trying to put on a drama about the 1MDB funds, and disagreed that it was Hazem, Yak and Low trying to put on the alleged drama to impress Najib and 1MDB board members.\n\nNajib\u2019s 1MDB trial before High Court judge Collin Lawrence Sequerah resumes tomorrow morning. \u2014 Malay Mail", "keyword": ["low",

Not least because, in essence, there was nothing innovative about it.\n\nIn the 1970s, Apple, Atari and Commodore were already producing computer models. But the strength of the IBM PC lay mainly in its ability to outsource the production of its components to other companies.\n\nAs soon as it was released, the company decided to publish the design and software code of the model, allowing other players in the sector to design compatible products.\n\nIn the IBM PC, the processor was an Intel 8088, the floppy drive was from Tandon, and the operating system was Microsoft\u2019s QDOS. IBM, on the other hand, supplied only the monitor, keyboard, and system unit.\n\nLittle by little, the personal computer became more commonplace in homes, whereas its predecessors had failed to earn mass acceptance.\n\nAnd in 1983, Time magazine awarded it the prize for machine of the year, even though the award is generally used to celebrate people.\n\nBacklash to the rapid success\n\nBut the price of fame turned out to be higher than expected. Indeed, in order to be competitive and put out a large quantity, IBM assembled the 5150 prototype in a hurry, without much verification afterwards.\n\nMeanwhile, Bill Gates\u2019s Microsoft, a newcomer to the operating system market, had set about establishing a dominant position.\n\nOther companies, such as Compaq, Dell or HP, were also starting to manufacture personal computers, more or less legally with respect to IBM.\n\nWithin a short time, competitors took over the PC market. In 2005, IBM sold its PC production business to Lenovo for US$1.3 billion.

But until then, he had a chance to form a government.\n\nDodging The Bullet\n\nAzhar Azizan Harun.\n\nAlmost immediately there were reports of the 14th Parliamentary Assembly sitting being postponed to May 18. It then became a single day sitting to hear the speech by the Yang di-Pertuan. There. There will be no meeting.\n\nDue to the Covid-19 dangers at the time, a Parliamentary meeting was set for 13 July instead. It was during this meeting that Mahiaddin flexed his support by narrowly clearing a major political test to remove the lower house speaker.\n\nDatuk Azhar Azizan Harun was installed as Dewan Rakyat Speaker after a lunch break without a vote from MPs. The move brought ire from the opposition.\n\nAll motions for a confidence vote were unlikely to happen.\n\nThe Third Wave\n\nElement5 Digital / Unsplash\n\nCovid-19 cases in Malaysia were low. The country was considered one of the best countries in the world to have handled the pandemic. It sustained the people\u2019s confidence in Mahiaddin. But then, a misstep\u2026\n\nThe Sabah state election (26 September to 12 October 2020) resulted in a third wave of Covid-19 cases as people from across the country went there to campaign and then returned home.\n\nAfterwards, the government scrambled to contain the outbreak by imposing a conditional movement order in Sabah and selected states.\n\nThe Hail Mary\n\nAs the number of cases increased, Mahiaddin\u2019s popularity waned. Nothing he did, from the ever-changing MCO and National Recovery Plan to Financial Assistance and SOPs, seemed to work.\n\nAll the while Mahiaddin was operating as the Prime Minister without a deputy. Some speculated that it was done to prevent votes for him from splintering.\n\nThat changed this year (2021) on 7 July when he named Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob as his deputy and Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein as a Senior Minister. A move, some say, was done to placate UMNO and for Mahiaddin to retain a majority.\n\nThe Fumble\n\nParliament, 26 July 2021\n\nOn 26 July 2021, Parliament and Law Minister Datuk Seri Takiyuddin Hassan, stated that Emergency Ordinances, which had been in place since 11 January, were retracted on 21 July.\n\nThe statement was then rebuked by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong who holds the Constitutional right to enact and repeal the Emergency Ordinance.\n\nThe issue fractured Mahiaddin\u2019s already fragile alliance. Because of it, two Ministers and about a dozen MPs pulled their support for the Prime Minister and the opposition challenged his majority.\n\nOn 13 August, Mahiaddin extended an olive branch to the opposition. He promised a General Election, a cross-party framework, and additional funds. But, it did not work. Some even looked at it as a bribe.\n\nToday (16 August), after less than two years, Mahiaddin has resigned his position as Prime Minister.\n\nLet us know on TRP\u2019s Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram!", "keyword": ["months", "malaysias", "17", "8th", "resigned", "installed", "agong", "cases", "mahiaddin", "minister", "prime", "dipertuan", "parliament", "election", "political", "vote"], "summary": "Tan Sri Mahiaddin Md Yasin, also known as Muhyiddin Yassin, had the unenviable task of being the Prime Minister of Malaysia during an unprecedented global pandemic.\nWe have covered his political journey up to when he became the Prime Minister on 29 February 2020.\nThe statement was then rebuked by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong who holds the Constitutional right to enact and repeal the Emergency Ordinance.\nBecause of it, two Ministers and about a dozen MPs pulled their support for the Prime Minister and the opposition challenged his majority.\nToday (16 August), after less than two years, Mahiaddin has resigned his position as Prime Minister.", "news": "The Rakyat Post", "date": "2021-08-16 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Buy And Sell Artisanal Goods On This Uniquely Malaysian e-Commerce Platform", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL2xpdmluZy8yMDIxLzA4LzE4L2J1eS1hbmQtc2VsbC1hcnRpc2FuYWwtZ29vZHMtb24tdGhpcy11bmlxdWVseS1tYWxheXNpYW4tZS1jb21tZXJjZS1wbGF0Zm9ybS_SAYABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlcmFreWF0cG9zdC5jb20vbGl2aW5nLzIwMjEvMDgvMTgvYnV5LWFuZC1zZWxsLWFydGlzYW5hbC1nb29kcy1vbi10aGlzLXVuaXF1ZWx5LW1hbGF5c2lhbi1lLWNvbW1lcmNlLXBsYXRmb3JtL2FtcC8?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Maya Suraya", "Azizul Rahman Ismail"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/TAHFI1.jpg", "text": "Subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates.\n\nThe Artisans Haven (TAH) is an online platform that showcases talented Malaysian artisans and their handmade products.\n\nFirst formed in September 2020, TAH was created as an answer to individuals who suddenly lost their jobs due to Covid-19 and had turned to the handmade artisan sector as a financial lifeline.\n\nAccording to Rosalie Lin, Brand & PR Advisory and co-Founder of TAH, what makes their platform different from other e-Commerce sites is how dedicated the team are to tell the story behind particular products and the sellers behind them.\n\nAnother distinctive feature is also how nothing is ever the same on the platform as most things are handmade, and can be customised to your preference \u2013 like a painting of your pet.\n\nA boost in confidence\n\nJade Lee, CEO and Co-Founder of TAH has made it the company\u2019s mission to boost the confidence of local artisans and micro-entrepreneurs.\n\nOne such entrepreneur is Aesos Lai, who used to run a souvenir gift shop and durian-centric caf\u00e9 at tourist hot spot Central Market.

Thus, he urged the government to manage the sales and distribution of self-test kits efficiently via subsidisation or price control mechanisms, and immediately curb and end sales of fake kits as well as sales by unqualified sellers.\n\n\n\nIn view of potential price control mechanisms, MPS suggested that the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) give a one-month grace period

must ensure price controls include not only standardisation of the sales price but also control of the cost price from the supplier,\u201d Amrahi noted.\n\nHe said this is because MPS has received numerous complaints from the public and pharmacists that self-test kits are being sold online and via WhatsApp at extremely low prices and with no guarantee of the product being genuine.\n\nAs KPDNHEP

These expanded measures will take effect today (16 August 2021).\n\n\u201cThe government understands that many personal activities have been disrupted as a result of this pandemic. This includes buying household items and doing basic upkeep like haircuts. The government is aware, the longer this is restricted, the greater the risk to the mental and physical health of the people,\u201d PM Muhyiddin said.\n\nThe government also sees that, he added, it is very important for economic sectors to reopen in stages because if the situation persists, the impact especially on business owners and their employees will be worse.\n\nThe latest series of updates are explained in detail below, and cover the following:\n\nThe 11 more sectors allowed to operate in Phase One of National Recovery Plan\n\nThe additional 11 sectors allowed to operate in Phase Two of National Recovery Plan\n\nManufacturing, construction, mining, and quarrying activities to resume, based on percentage of fully-vaccinated workforce\n\nVisiting parks for exercising and for recreational activities to be allowed (for individual activities only)\n\nPlans for travel bubble to pilot with Langkawi Island\n\nScroll below for the updates.\n\nUpdates to Phase One of National Recovery Plan\n\nIn that regard, for states under Phase One of NRP, there are 11 business sectors that are allowed to operate, effective 16 August 2021. They are:\n\nCar wash; Electrical and electronics stores; Household goods and kitchen utensils; Furniture stores; Sports equipment stores; Car accessories stores; Car distribution and sales centre; Morning and farmers\u2019 markets; Clothing, fashion, and accessories stores; Jewellery stores, and Hairdressers and beauty salons (for basic barber services only).\n\nThis decision came after the government assessed the pandemic situation with the risk assessment data conducted by the Ministry of Health Malaysia (MOH), Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) and \u201cafter discussing with all stakeholders in the sectors of interest\u201d.\n\nThe Prime Minister also noted that for clothing, fashion, and accessory stores; jewellery stores; as well as barbershops and beauty salons, there are additional health SOPs that must be adhered to.\n\n\u201cThis includes wearing gloves, limiting business time between employees and customers and not allowing the use of fitting rooms. These SOPs may be complicated but they are for the safety of employees and customers.\n\n\u201cOwners of premises listed in the business that can re-operate must also ensure that customers who enter the premises must show a COVID-19 digital vaccination certificate to prove that the individual has received a complete vaccination,\u201d PM Muhyiddin said.\n\nUpdates to Phase Two of National Recovery Plan\n\nFor states in Phase Two of NRP, an additional 11 business sectors will be allowed to operate (over and above those listed in Phase One), effective 16 August 2021. They are:\n\nPhotographic goods store and photographic services; Second-hand items; Florists and nurseries; Handicraft and souvenir stores; Antique stores; Toy stores; Carpet stores; Creative content and creative industry equipment stores; Outdoor equipment stores (including camping, fishing and other equipment); Cosmetics, skin care, and perfume stores, and Tobacco stores (including vape and electronic cigarettes).\n\n\u201cOwners of premises listed have to ensure that customers who enter the premises must show a COVID-19 digital vaccination certificate to prove that the individual has received a complete vaccination,\u201d the Prime Minister reiterated.\n\nManufacturing, construction, mining, and quarrying activities to resume\n\n\u201cI would also like to inform that the government has agreed to allow all non-essential activities in the manufacturing, construction, mining and quarrying sectors to resume operations from 16 August 2021 in states that are under Phase One, Two, and Three of NRP.\n\n\u201cHowever, the operating capacity depends on the rate of complete vaccination of the workers,\u201d PM Muhyiddin said.\n\nThis translates into the following:\n\nShould the manufacturing, construction, mining and quarrying business have 80% to 100% of employees fully-vaccinated, then they are allowed to operate with 100% capacity.\n\nSimilarly, for 60% to 79% of employees fully-vaccinated, then operating capacity is at 80%;\n\nFinally, for 40% to 59% of fully-vaccinated workforce, then operating capacity is at 60%.\n\nFurther, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) reminded that companies are required to declare the number and names of their fully-vaccinated employees in the COVID-19 Intelligent Management System (CIMS) 3.0 system.\n\nUpon declaration, the company may directly download the latest approval letter from the system to operate.\n\nThe government understands, PM Muhyiddin noted, this decision will provoke various reactions from the public who are concerned about the risk of contagion. He reassured that this decision is \u201cmade with care\u201d, and that it is necessary because \u201cmany employers began to reduce the workforce, causing many to lose their jobs\u201d - and the government cannot allow this situation to continue.\n\nPM Muhyiddin added: \u201cI would like to remind all employers to comply with and meet the conditions that have been set before resuming operations to ensure the safety of employees and secure work. At the same time, take full advantage of the wage subsidy initiatives provided by the Government to ensure that every employee receives their salary payment.\u201d\n\nVisiting parks for exercising and for recreational activities\n\nBeyond the economic aspect of Malaysia, the Prime Minister also announced more measures to boost the nation\u2019s mental wellbeing. This is by allowing locals in states under Phase One of NRP to visit parks for exercising and for recreational activities.\n\n\u201cBut remember, only activities that can be done individually such as jogging, cycling and exercising are allowed, in line with the sports and leisure SOPs in Phase One of NRP,\u201d PM Muhyiddin said.\n\nHe added that the public is also only allowed to visit public recreational parks in the neighbourhood; not to cross states, or regions to go to other recreational parks. Local authorities and agencies will monitor the situation, and ensure that health SOPs are adhered to.\n\nPlans for travel bubble to pilot with Langkawi Island\n\nIn his speech, PM Muhyiddin also spoke of the government\u2019s plans to implement a travel bubble at Langkawi Island. This will be a pilot project for the fully-vaccinated, and will be crucial to \u201crevive the tourism industry.\u201d\n\nHe shared that the Ministry of Health (MOH) and health experts have advised the government to implement this plan only when the complete vaccination rate of the population of Langkawi Island reaches at least 80% of the total population.\n\nAs of 15 August 2021, however, according to the COVID-19 Vaccine Supply Assurance Special Committee (Jawatankuasa Khas Jaminan Akses Bekalan Vaksin COVID-19/JKJAV), the nation\u2019s vaccination rate is at 45.9% (with two doses) and at 72.9% (with one dose).\n\nApart from Langkawi Island, PM Muhyiddin said, the government also has plans to implement a tourism bubble approach in more destinations, other than Langkawi Island, throughout the country.\n\n\u201cHowever, this matter is still at the planning stage and the government will look at the results of the pilot project (Langkawi Island) first. If all goes well, the tourism bubble will be implemented more widely,\u201d the Prime Minister added.\n\nAlso read: SOPs for fully-vaccinated individuals in Malaysia: Phases 1, 2 and 3 of NRP [Aug

self-test kits and wrong use of these kits would produce inaccurate results such as false negatives that would not help in combating the pandemic.\n\n\"Furthermore, with more cases of BID, the government needs to act immediately before the situation worsens,\" he said in a statement on Thursday (Aug 19).\n\nHe added that ideally, self-test kits should be provided free to the public, but if the government is not able to do so, a mechanism to subsidise the cost should be put into place.\n\nThus, MPS is urging the government to manage the sales and distribution of self-test kits efficiently via subsidisation or price control mechanisms, and immediately curb and end sales of fake kits, as well as sales by unqualified sellers.\n\nIn view of potential price control mechanisms, MPS advised the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry to give a grace period of one month before implementation as the move would assist pharmacists who have already purchased the self-test kits at a higher cost to clear the more expensive stock.\n\n\"In the event a grace period is not granted, MPS wants a subsidy or refund mechanism to be put in place to avoid losses to pharmacists who purchased the stocks in good faith.\n\n\"In ensuring price controls benefit the public, the ministry must ensure price controls include not only standardisation of the sales price, but also control of the cost price from the supplier,\" he said.\n\nThis is because MPS has received numerous complaints from the public and from pharmacists of self-test kits being sold online and via WhatsApp at extremely low prices, and with no guarantee of the product being genuine.\n\nAs the ministry only has a general complaints page at https://eaduan.kpdnhep.gov.my/, MPS also suggested that a dedicated page be set up to enable complaints against fake products and sales by non-pharmacists and non-doctors.\n\n\"This would enable turnover of complaints to be handled quickly and efficiently by the ministry's enforcement arm,\" said Amrahi.\n\nHe added that it is critical that a mechanism to identify fake and genuine stock of self-test kits be implemented to further protect the public and suppliers of self-test kits, the ministry and the Malaysian Device Authority (MDA) should work on it immediately.\n\n\"In addition to all the above, the ministry should also help enforce the MDA's policy for conditional approval that allows only licensed pharmacies and healthcare facilities to sell self-test kits online with a proactive approach in barring runners and unqualified sellers from selling self-test kits, as they don\u2019t conform to MDA\u2019s prerequisites of stock-keeping and information sharing with customers,\" he said.", "keyword": ["pharmacists", "kits", "regulation",

David Marshel said DBKL was not looking at the big picture of the issue.\n\n\u201cDBKL should go after the stores that sell illegal and cheap liquor,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen you stop legitimate outlets from selling hard liquor, you will only create illegal ones that may very likely thrive.\n\n\u201cIllegal liquor is bottled to look like the genuine ones. They are sold in the black market.\u201d\n\nMarshel said instead of going after Chinese medicine halls and convenience stores, DBKL should ban the sale of hard liquor at sundry shops, which he said was easily accessible to youths, especially schoolchildren.\n\nAccepting the ruling\n\nMeanwhile the Kuala Lumpur chapter of Federation of Sundry Goods Merchants Association of Malaysia (FSGMAM) has decided not to appeal against DBKL\u2019s new liquor regulations.\n\n\n\nHong says FSGMAM will not appeal against DBKL\u2019s new hard liquor regulations once it comes into force.Its president Hong Chee Meng said the association found the multiple licences that they had to apply from various government agencies like DBKL as well as Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP), too cumbersome.\n\n\u201cRed tape aside, it is also expensive to renew the licence fees annually,\u201d Hong said.\n\n\u201cMany feel that the numerous checks by enforcement authorities such as DBKL, KPDNHEP, the police and Customs were taking its toll.\n\n\u201cThe general feedback from our members in Kuala Lumpur is that they will no longer sell hard liquor on their premises,\u201d he said, adding that in some states, the annual liquor licence fee was as high as RM5,000.\n\nFSGMAM has some 4,000 members nationwide with about 10,000 sundry shops. In Kuala Lumpur, there is slightly over 1,000 members. However, less than 20% sell hard liquor.\n\nDBKL started clamping down on the sale of liquor last June when Annuar called on it to stop issuing liquor licences.\n\nThe move was reportedly aimed at curbing cases of drink-driving but it had not gone down well with stakeholders who were not consulted about it.\n\nBased on DBKL\u2019s records, 2,400 liquor licences have been issued so far and the Excise Licensing Board of the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur (ELBKL) was looking at processing some 1,100 applications pending since 2019.\n\nA source from City Hall said the excise board would meet with members and Kuala Lumpur mayor Datuk Seri Mahadi Che Ngah soon, and a decision would be made on whether to implement or cancel the regulations.\n\n\u201cFrom what I hear, it\u2019s 50/50 right now, so anything can happen,\u201d added the source.\n\nELBKL chairman Datuk Jason Lau Beng Wei confirmed that a meeting was being planned to discuss the matter.\n\n\u201cFor now I have no comments but please bear with us on this,\u201d he said.", "keyword": ["liquor", "prior", "impose", "blanket", "dbkl", "ban", "hard", "sell", "association", "discussions", "sale", "chinese", "stakeholders", "decision", "shops", "appeal", "members"], "summary": "Effective Oct 1, they will no longer be allowed to sell hard liquor.\nThose who want to buy hard liquor can still do so at liquor shops, pubs, bars, restaurants as well as supermarkets and hypermarkets in shopping complexes.\nSeveral members expressed their disappointment last year when DBKL decided to impose the blanket ban on the sale of hard liquor without holding discussions with stakeholders.\n\u201cWhen you stop legitimate outlets from selling hard liquor, you will only create illegal ones that may very likely thrive.\nHowever, less than 20% sell hard liquor.", "news": "The Star Online", "date": "2021-08-16 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Toyota celebrates 50m Corollas sold worldwide", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWFsYXlzaWFucmVzZXJ2ZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wOC8xNy90b3lvdGEtY2VsZWJyYXRlcy01MG0tY29yb2xsYXMtc29sZC13b3JsZHdpZGUv0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVtYWxheXNpYW5yZXNlcnZlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA4LzE3L3RveW90YS1jZWxlYnJhdGVzLTUwbS1jb3JvbGxhcy1zb2xkLXdvcmxkd2lkZS9hbXAv?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://themalaysianreserve.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Toyota.jpg", "text": "by BERNAMA / pic by AFP\n\nKUALA LUMPUR \u2013 Japanese carmaker Toyota has sold 50 million units of its Corolla model worldwide with 300,000 sold in the Malaysian market to date.\n\nPresident of UMW Toyota Motor Ravindran K said the success of the model was due to it being a new standard of automotive excellence in this class of cars, offering customers a dynamic and advanced sedan with luxurious styling.\n\n\u201cEach generation, right from the very first, has been a contributor in the brand transformation.

This was despite Low not having any official 1MDB positions.\n\nMohd Hazem went on to assert his belief that Najib as the prime minister was part of Low\u2019s \u201cscheme\u201d for 1MDB, also claiming that Najib had allegedly known that 1MDB\u2019s funds had gone missing but that the then prime minister was purportedly putting on a \u201cdrama\u201d by allegedly pretending to enquire about the funds\u2019 status.\n\nMohd Hazem said all this while testifying as the 10th prosecution witness against Najib in the latter\u2019s trial involving more than RM2 billion of 1MDB funds.\n\nUnder cross-examination by Najib\u2019s lawyer Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah, Mohd Hazem agreed that former 1MDB senior management officials Terence Geh and Jasmine Loo were directly under Low\u2019s control and that he knew from the beginning when he became CEO that the duo\u2019s loyalty was only to Low and not to 1MDB. The two officials were supposed to be under Hazem\u2019s supervision as the CEO.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the two 1MDB officials acted solely at Low\u2019s direction and that they were not necessarily acting for the interests of 1MDB, Mohd Hazem said he did not do anything to avoid this situation as he equated Low and Najib together.\n\nShafee: Now I want to confront you with this important question, why didn\u2019t you do anything about it? Why didn\u2019t you at least bring this up to the board of directors?\n\nHazem: I think we go back to what I told before, they are the people of Jho Low, and Jho Low basically is the prime minister.\n\nWhen Shafee asked if he had attempt to clarify if Low was the actual alter ego of the then prime minister Najib, Hazem said he had spoke with 1MDB then chairman Tan Sri Lodin Wok Kamaruddin, 1MDB then director Tan Sri Ismee Ismail and Najib\u2019s then principal private secretary Datuk Azlin Alias. Hazem later said he had done his best to speak to the relevant personnel who have \u201cdirect access\u201d to the prime minister.\n\nHazem claimed that Lodin and the whole 1MDB board already knew that the company was being run by Low.\n\nAsked for what he specifically told Lodin about both Geh and Loo, Hazem said most of their conversations revolved around their \u201cconcerns of Jho Low handling 1MDB\u201d.\n\nHazem said that he had basically told Lodin about 1MDB being in Low\u2019s \u201chands\u201d and expressed concern over Low running or controlling the company, adding that Lodin had also shared the same concerns.\n\nAsked by Shafee, Hazem confirmed that he had never asked or suggested to Lodin for them to confirm with then PM Najib on what is Low\u2019s role and whether Low controlled 1MDB to the exclusion of Hazem as the CEO.\n\nShafee: But you agree the way you described Jho Low controlling the senior management, you were virtually not the CEO?\n\nHazem: Yes.\n\nShafee: Jho Low was running the company through the management?\n\nHazem: Yes, in a way.\n\nHazem confirmed that he did not suggest to Lodin for them to resolve this by checking with then prime minister Najib if this was how the company 1MDB is to operate, and that he did not take any other measures and did not know if Lodin had asked Najib about such issues.\n\nShafee then suggested that Hazem was making presumptions without evidence that \u201cJho Low is the prime minister and the prime minister is Jho Low\u201d and that Low\u2019s directions essentially came from Najib, but Hazem pointed to meetings where both Najib and Low were present regarding 1MDB matters.\n\nHazem specifically cited a November 28, 2013 meeting at Najib\u2019s house at Jalan Langgak Duta attended by 1MDB officials and BSI Singapore representative Yak Yew Chee, where Low was present and had started the meeting by briefing about 1MDB matters such as 1MDB\u2019s US$2.3 billion funds that were purportedly invested overseas under the custody of BSI Bank and what BSI Bank had told 1MDB auditor KPMG about the funds.\n\nWhen asked how the November 2013 meeting showed that directives from Low to 1MDB management are what Najib has directed, Hazem replied: \u201cThis is with regards to 1MDB, why would Jho Low need to be there?\u201d\n\nHazem later also pointed out that Low was an \u201cexternal party\u201d and had attending the meeting at the prime minister\u2019s house on 1MDB matters, saying that this was evidence that Low was representing Najib\u2019s interests: \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that he (Low) shouldn\u2019t be there at all. He was there and accepted in the meeting.\u201d\n\nHazem confirmed that he had never asked Najib on what Low\u2019s role was and how he was supposed to react as CEO.\n\nHazem had previously described Low as Najib\u2019s trusted right-hand man, proxy and special adviser for 1MDB.\n\nAbout the bonus\n\nShafee: You said truly you were not a CEO.\n\nHazem: Yes.\n\nShafee: You were virtually led by the nose with the greatest respect?\n\nHazem: Yes.\n\nHazem agreed with Shafee that he was concerned and ashamed at having being reduced to being impotent as a CEO and that this affected his pride, adding that he had very little control or no control over the matter.\n\nShafee then repeatedly grilled Hazem about the decision in a 1MDB board meeting on April 22, 2014 \u2014 which Hazem had excused himself from \u2014 to give him a bonus after the 1MDB remuneration committee assessed his performance as having \u201cexceeded expectations\u201d.\n\nShafee repeatedly questioned whether Hazem had felt ashamed for receiving a bonus on top of his monthly salary of more than RM90,000 when the company was allegedly going down the drain and when his pride was affected as he was led by the nose as a CEO.\n\nDeputy public prosecutor Akram Ahmad Gharib then said such questions were not relevant to the charges that Najib was facing and that Hazem had already answered that it was a decision made by the 1MDB board.\n\nShafee explained that he was trying to challenge Hazem\u2019s credibility: \u201cI\u2019m trying to show the inconsistent answers he has provided, namely on one hand he said he felt ashamed, his pride is affected because as a CEO he was completely not CEO, Jho Low was CEO, so he was not doing any work, he was just taking orders virtually, so if your pride is affected, naturally the question is why do you receive so much bonus and how do you feel?\u201d\n\nHazem later said he was not ashamed to have received his salary and bonus worth a combined RM2.9 million for the entire year of 2014 as he had done his job as required to meet targets set by the 1MDB board.\n\nHazem disagreed with Shafee\u2019s suggestion that he was purportedly shameless in receiving the salary and bonus as he was part of a purported conspiracy with Low to hoodwink 1MDB.\n\nWas it a \u2018drama\u2019?\n\nShafee highlighted the November 28, 2013 meeting at Najib\u2019s house and another meeting where Hazem was subsequently recorded as informing KPMG on another day that BSI Bank\u2019s Yak had assured the prime minister that 1MDB\u2019s US$2.3 billion investment was intact.\n\nHazem said he did not know for a fact at that point that the funds had disappeared, but had suspected that the funds \u201cprobably have disappeared\u201d.\n\nShafee then questioned why Hazem had not asked to speak privately to then prime minister Najib and share his suspicions about 1MDB funds to help save the company and the country, with Hazem then saying he believed Najib already knew the funds were gone.\n\nHazem: Because as far as I\u2019m concerned, the prime minister knows it, he is part of the scheme.\n\nShafee: The prime minister knows the money disappeared?\n\nHazem: From the very beginning I told you, the presence of Jho Low is the prime minister, that was what I was told.\n\nHazem however agreed he had never confirmed if Low was \u201ctruly the PM\u201d and agreed that he was making a presumption that Najib already knew the 1MDB funds were missing.\n\nShafee: Do you think Datuk Seri Najib, at that meeting, do you think Datuk Seri Najib when he asked for the assurance of the funds, he was being briefed about the funds, all those meetings, are you saying Datuk Seri Najib was pretending to ask all these questions because he knows the money disappeared?\n\nHazem: I won\u2019t answer on his behalf.\n\nShafee: I\u2019m asking you, are you saying Datuk Seri Najib when he was being briefed about the funds, it was all a drama by Datuk Seri Najib?\n\nHazem: Yes.\n\nHazem later disagreed with Shafee\u2019s suggestion that it was not Najib trying to put on a drama about the 1MDB funds, and disagreed that it was Hazem, Yak and Low trying to put on the alleged drama to impress Najib and 1MDB board members.\n\nNajib\u2019s 1MDB trial before High Court judge Collin Lawrence Sequerah resumes tomorrow morning. \u2014 Malay Mail", "keyword": ["low",

Muhyiddin Yassin (pix) said he had made various efforts till the last minute in a bid to keep the Perikatan Nasional (PN) government intact, at least until it had completed its duty in managing the Covid-19 pandemic and reviving the economy.\n\nHowever, he said his efforts were unsuccessful because certain parties were greedy in trying to grab power without considering its impact on the people\u2019s lives and livelihoods.\n\n\u201cTo me, what has happened is the will of Allah s.w.t. which is an episode in the history of my political struggle,\u201d he said in a special address on local television today.\n\nMuhyiddin said he had tendered his resignation as the prime minister and that of the whole Cabinet to the Yang di-Pertuan Agong in accordance with Article 43(4) of the Federal Constitution because he had lost majority support in the Dewan Rakyat.\n\nMuhyiddin said he had initially proposed to use Parliament to determine his legitimacy as prime minister but decided to resign after 15 Umno Members of Parliament withdrew support for him and the opposition rejected his offer of cross-party cooperation.\n\n\u201cI heard the sincere appeal of millions of Malaysians for me to carry on and not to resign.

IBM, on the other hand, supplied only the monitor, keyboard, and system unit.\n\nLittle by little, the personal computer became more commonplace in homes, whereas its predecessors had failed to earn mass acceptance.\n\nAnd in 1983, Time magazine awarded it the prize for machine of the year, even though the award is generally used to celebrate people.\n\nBacklash to the rapid success\n\nBut the price of fame turned out to be higher than expected. Indeed, in order to be competitive and put out a large quantity, IBM assembled the 5150 prototype in a hurry, without much verification afterwards.\n\nMeanwhile, Bill Gates\u2019s Microsoft, a newcomer to the operating system market, had set about establishing a dominant position.\n\nOther companies, such as Compaq, Dell or HP, were also starting to manufacture personal computers, more or less legally with respect to IBM.\n\nWithin a short time, competitors took over the PC market.

covered his political journey up to when he became the Prime Minister on 29 February 2020.\n\nREAD MORE: The Dark Horse of Malaysian Politics: Muhyiddin Yassin\n\nHowever, let\u2019s take a look at how he got to where he is today and the political scheme of things that have led to him tendering his resignation as the eighth Prime Minister of Malaysia.\n\nWhere The Troubles Began\n\nMahiaddin being sworn in.\n\nAt 72, Mahiaddin was sworn in as Prime Minister by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong on 1 March 2020 after a week of uncertainty following the collapse of Pakatan Harapan government that was led by Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad.\n\nThe Yang di-Pertuan Agong Al-Sultan Abdullah Ri\u2019ayatuddin Al-Mustafa Billah Shah intervened to solve the deadlock by consulting with all Members of Parliament one-by-one in private, before appointing Mahiaddin as the Prime Minister.\n\nAs he was put into the position without a general election or public vote, there was still a chance that Mahiaddin could be replaced when Parliament convened on 9 March 2020. But until then, he had a chance to form a government.\n\nDodging The Bullet\n\nAzhar Azizan Harun.\n\nAlmost immediately there were reports of the 14th Parliamentary Assembly sitting being postponed to May 18. It then became a single day sitting to hear the speech by the Yang di-Pertuan. There. There will be no meeting.\n\nDue to the Covid-19 dangers at the time, a Parliamentary meeting was set for 13 July instead. It was during this meeting that Mahiaddin flexed his support by narrowly clearing a major political test to remove the lower house speaker.\n\nDatuk Azhar Azizan Harun was installed as Dewan Rakyat Speaker after a lunch break without a vote from MPs. The move brought ire from the opposition.\n\nAll motions for a confidence vote were unlikely to happen.\n\nThe Third Wave\n\nElement5 Digital / Unsplash\n\nCovid-19 cases in Malaysia were low. The country was considered one of the best countries in the world to have handled the pandemic. It sustained the people\u2019s confidence in Mahiaddin. But then, a misstep\u2026\n\nThe Sabah state election (26 September to 12 October 2020) resulted in a third wave of Covid-19 cases as people from across the country went there to campaign and then returned home.\n\nAfterwards, the government scrambled to contain the outbreak by imposing a conditional movement order in Sabah and selected states.\n\nThe Hail Mary\n\nAs the number of cases increased, Mahiaddin\u2019s popularity waned. Nothing he did, from the ever-changing MCO and National Recovery Plan to Financial Assistance and SOPs, seemed to work.\n\nAll the while Mahiaddin was operating as the Prime Minister without a deputy. Some speculated that it was done to prevent votes for him from splintering.\n\nThat changed this year (2021) on 7 July when he named Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob as his deputy and Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein as a Senior Minister. A move, some say, was done to placate UMNO and for Mahiaddin to retain a majority.\n\nThe Fumble\n\nParliament, 26 July 2021\n\nOn 26 July 2021, Parliament and Law Minister Datuk Seri Takiyuddin Hassan, stated that Emergency Ordinances, which had been in place since 11 January, were retracted on 21 July.\n\nThe statement was then rebuked by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong who holds the Constitutional right to enact and repeal the Emergency Ordinance.\n\nThe issue fractured Mahiaddin\u2019s already fragile alliance. Because of it, two Ministers and about a dozen MPs pulled their support for the Prime Minister and the opposition challenged his majority.\n\nOn 13 August, Mahiaddin extended an olive branch to the opposition. He promised a General Election, a cross-party framework, and additional funds. But, it did not work. Some even looked at it as a bribe.\n\nToday (16 August), after less than two years, Mahiaddin has resigned his position as Prime Minister.\n\nLet us know on TRP\u2019s Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram!", "keyword": ["months", "malaysias", "17", "8th", "resigned", "installed", "agong", "cases", "mahiaddin", "minister", "prime", "dipertuan", "parliament", "election", "political", "vote"], "summary": "Tan Sri Mahiaddin Md Yasin, also known as Muhyiddin Yassin, had the unenviable task of being the Prime Minister of Malaysia during an unprecedented global pandemic.\nWe have covered his political journey up to when he became the Prime Minister on 29 February 2020.\nThe statement was then rebuked by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong who holds the Constitutional right to enact and repeal the Emergency Ordinance.\nBecause of it, two Ministers and about a dozen MPs pulled their support for the Prime Minister and the opposition challenged his majority.\nToday (16 August), after less than two years, Mahiaddin has resigned his position as Prime Minister.", "news": "The Rakyat Post", "date": "2021-08-16 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Buy And Sell Artisanal Goods On This Uniquely Malaysian e-Commerce Platform", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL2xpdmluZy8yMDIxLzA4LzE4L2J1eS1hbmQtc2VsbC1hcnRpc2FuYWwtZ29vZHMtb24tdGhpcy11bmlxdWVseS1tYWxheXNpYW4tZS1jb21tZXJjZS1wbGF0Zm9ybS_SAYABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlcmFreWF0cG9zdC5jb20vbGl2aW5nLzIwMjEvMDgvMTgvYnV5LWFuZC1zZWxsLWFydGlzYW5hbC1nb29kcy1vbi10aGlzLXVuaXF1ZWx5LW1hbGF5c2lhbi1lLWNvbW1lcmNlLXBsYXRmb3JtL2FtcC8?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Maya Suraya", "Azizul Rahman Ismail"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/TAHFI1.jpg", "text": "Subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates.\n\nThe Artisans Haven (TAH) is an online platform that showcases talented Malaysian artisans and their handmade products.\n\nFirst formed in September 2020, TAH was created as an answer to individuals who suddenly lost their jobs due to Covid-19 and had turned to the handmade artisan sector as a financial lifeline.\n\nAccording to Rosalie Lin, Brand & PR Advisory and co-Founder of TAH, what makes their platform different from other e-Commerce sites is how dedicated the team are to tell the story behind particular products and the sellers behind them.\n\nAnother distinctive feature is also how nothing is ever the same on the platform as most things are handmade, and can be customised to your preference \u2013 like a painting of your pet.\n\nA boost in confidence\n\nJade Lee, CEO and Co-Founder of TAH has made it the company\u2019s mission to boost the confidence of local artisans and micro-entrepreneurs.\n\nOne such entrepreneur is Aesos Lai, who used to run a souvenir gift shop and durian-centric caf\u00e9 at tourist hot spot Central Market.

Thus, he urged the government to manage the sales and distribution of self-test kits efficiently via subsidisation or price control mechanisms, and immediately curb and end sales of fake kits as well as sales by unqualified sellers.\n\n\n\nIn view of potential price control mechanisms, MPS suggested that the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) give a one-month grace period before implementation as the move would assist pharmacists who have already purchased the self-test kits at a higher cost to clear the more expensive stock.\n\n\u201cIn the event a grace period is not granted, MPS wants a subsidy or refund mechanism be put in place to avoid losses to pharmacists who purchased the stocks in good faith.\n\n\u201cIn ensuring price controls benefit the public, KPDNHEP must ensure price controls include not only standardisation of the sales price but also control of the cost price from the supplier,\u201d Amrahi noted.\n\nHe said this is because MPS has received numerous complaints from the public and pharmacists that self-test kits are being sold online and via WhatsApp at extremely low prices and with no guarantee of the product being genuine.\n\nAs KPDNHEP only has a general complaints page, MPS also suggested that a dedicated page be set up to enable complaints against fake products and sales by non-pharmacists and non-doctors.\n\nAmrahi said this would enable turnover of complaints to be handled quickly and efficiently by the KPDNHEP enforcement arm.\n\nHe added that it is critical that a mechanism to identify fake and genuine stock of self-test kits be implemented to further protect the public.\n\n\u201cSuppliers of self-test kits, KPDNHEP and the Malaysian Device Authority (MDA) should work on this immediately,\u201d he stressed.\n\nAdditionally, he said KPDNHEP should also help enforce MDA\u2019s policy for conditional approval that allows only licensed pharmacies and healthcare facilities to sell selftest kits

These expanded measures will take effect today (16 August 2021).\n\n\u201cThe government understands that many personal activities have been disrupted as a result of this pandemic. This includes buying household items and doing basic upkeep like haircuts. The government is aware, the longer this is restricted, the greater the risk to the mental and physical health of the people,\u201d PM Muhyiddin said.\n\nThe government also sees that, he added, it is very important for economic sectors to reopen in stages because if the situation persists, the impact especially on business owners and their employees will be worse.\n\nThe latest series of updates are explained in detail below, and cover the following:\n\nThe 11 more sectors allowed to operate in Phase One of National Recovery Plan\n\nThe additional 11 sectors allowed to operate in Phase Two of National Recovery Plan\n\nManufacturing, construction, mining, and quarrying activities to resume, based on percentage of fully-vaccinated workforce\n\nVisiting parks for exercising and for recreational activities to be allowed (for individual activities only)\n\nPlans for travel bubble to pilot with Langkawi Island\n\nScroll below for the updates.\n\nUpdates to Phase One of National Recovery Plan\n\nIn that regard, for states under Phase One of NRP, there are 11 business sectors that are allowed to operate, effective 16 August 2021. They are:\n\nCar wash; Electrical and electronics stores; Household goods and kitchen utensils; Furniture stores; Sports equipment stores; Car accessories stores; Car distribution and sales centre; Morning and farmers\u2019 markets; Clothing, fashion, and accessories stores; Jewellery stores, and Hairdressers and beauty salons (for basic barber services only).\n\nThis decision came after the government assessed the pandemic situation with the risk assessment data conducted by the Ministry of Health Malaysia (MOH), Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) and \u201cafter discussing with all stakeholders in the sectors of interest\u201d.\n\nThe Prime Minister also noted that for clothing, fashion, and accessory stores; jewellery stores; as well as barbershops and beauty salons, there are additional health SOPs that must be adhered to.\n\n\u201cThis includes wearing gloves, limiting business time between employees and customers and not allowing the use of fitting rooms. These SOPs may be complicated but they are for the safety of employees and customers.\n\n\u201cOwners of premises listed in the business that can re-operate must also ensure that customers who enter the premises must show a COVID-19 digital vaccination certificate to prove that the individual has received a complete vaccination,\u201d PM Muhyiddin said.\n\nUpdates to Phase Two of National Recovery Plan\n\nFor states in Phase Two of NRP, an additional 11 business sectors will be allowed to operate (over and above those listed in Phase One), effective 16 August 2021. They are:\n\nPhotographic goods store and photographic services; Second-hand items; Florists and nurseries; Handicraft and souvenir stores; Antique stores; Toy stores; Carpet stores; Creative content and creative industry equipment stores; Outdoor equipment stores (including camping, fishing and other equipment); Cosmetics, skin care, and perfume stores, and Tobacco stores (including vape and electronic cigarettes).\n\n\u201cOwners of premises listed have to ensure that customers who enter the premises must show a COVID-19 digital vaccination certificate to prove that the individual has received a complete vaccination,\u201d the Prime Minister reiterated.\n\nManufacturing, construction, mining, and quarrying activities to resume\n\n\u201cI would also like to inform that the government has agreed to allow all non-essential activities in the manufacturing, construction, mining and quarrying sectors to resume operations from 16 August 2021 in states that are under Phase One, Two, and Three of NRP.\n\n\u201cHowever, the operating capacity depends on the rate of complete vaccination of the workers,\u201d PM Muhyiddin said.\n\nThis translates into the following:\n\nShould the manufacturing, construction, mining and quarrying business have 80% to 100% of employees fully-vaccinated, then they are allowed to operate with 100% capacity.\n\nSimilarly, for 60% to 79% of employees fully-vaccinated, then operating capacity is at 80%;\n\nFinally, for 40% to 59% of fully-vaccinated workforce, then operating capacity is at 60%.\n\nFurther, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) reminded that companies are required to declare the number and names of their fully-vaccinated employees in the COVID-19 Intelligent Management System (CIMS) 3.0 system.\n\nUpon declaration, the company may directly download the latest approval letter from the system to operate.\n\nThe government understands, PM Muhyiddin noted, this decision will provoke various reactions from the public who are concerned about the risk of contagion. He reassured that this decision is \u201cmade with care\u201d, and that it is necessary because \u201cmany employers began to reduce the workforce, causing many to lose their jobs\u201d - and the government cannot allow this situation to continue.\n\nPM Muhyiddin added: \u201cI would like to remind all employers to comply with and meet the conditions that have been set before resuming operations to ensure the safety of employees and secure work. At the same time, take full advantage of the wage subsidy initiatives provided by the Government to ensure that every employee receives their salary payment.\u201d\n\nVisiting parks for exercising and for recreational activities\n\nBeyond the economic aspect of Malaysia, the Prime Minister also announced more measures to boost the nation\u2019s mental wellbeing. This is by allowing locals in states under Phase One of NRP to visit parks for exercising and for recreational activities.\n\n\u201cBut remember, only activities that can be done individually such as jogging, cycling and exercising are allowed, in line with the sports and leisure SOPs in Phase One of NRP,\u201d PM Muhyiddin said.\n\nHe added that the public is also only allowed to visit public recreational parks in the neighbourhood; not to cross states, or regions to go to other recreational parks. Local authorities and agencies will monitor the situation, and ensure that health SOPs are adhered to.\n\nPlans for travel bubble to pilot with Langkawi Island\n\nIn his speech, PM Muhyiddin also spoke of the government\u2019s plans to implement a travel bubble at Langkawi Island. This will be a pilot project for the fully-vaccinated, and will be crucial to \u201crevive the tourism industry.\u201d\n\nHe shared that the Ministry of Health (MOH) and health experts have advised the government to implement this plan only when the complete vaccination rate of the population of Langkawi Island reaches at least 80% of the total population.\n\nAs of 15 August 2021, however, according to the COVID-19 Vaccine Supply Assurance Special Committee (Jawatankuasa Khas Jaminan Akses Bekalan Vaksin COVID-19/JKJAV), the nation\u2019s vaccination rate is at 45.9% (with two doses) and at 72.9% (with one dose).\n\nApart from Langkawi Island, PM Muhyiddin said, the government also has plans to implement a tourism bubble approach in more destinations, other than Langkawi Island, throughout the country.\n\n\u201cHowever, this matter is still at the planning stage and the government will look at the results of the pilot project (Langkawi Island) first. If all goes well, the tourism bubble will be implemented more widely,\u201d the Prime Minister added.\n\nAlso read: SOPs for fully-vaccinated individuals in Malaysia: Phases 1, 2 and 3 of NRP [Aug

the unregulated sales of Covid-19 self-test kits, especially via WhatsApp and social media, as well as sales by unqualified sellers who are neither pharmacists nor doctors.\n\n\"Fake Covid-19 self-test kits and wrong use of these kits would produce inaccurate results such as false negatives that would not help in combating the pandemic.\n\n\"Furthermore, with more cases of BID, the government needs to act immediately before the situation worsens,\" he said in a statement on Thursday (Aug 19).\n\nHe added that ideally, self-test kits should be provided free to the public, but if the government is not able to do so, a mechanism to subsidise the cost should be put into place.\n\nThus, MPS is urging the government to manage the sales and distribution of self-test kits efficiently via subsidisation or price control mechanisms, and immediately curb and end sales of fake kits, as well as sales by unqualified sellers.\n\nIn view of potential price control mechanisms, MPS advised the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry to give a grace period of one month before implementation as the move would assist pharmacists who have already purchased the self-test kits at a higher cost to clear the more expensive stock.\n\n\"In the event a grace period is not granted, MPS wants a subsidy or refund mechanism to be put in place to avoid losses to pharmacists who purchased the stocks in good faith.\n\n\"In ensuring price controls benefit the public, the ministry must ensure price controls include not only standardisation of the sales price, but also control of the cost price from the supplier,\" he said.\n\nThis is because MPS has received numerous complaints from the public and from pharmacists of self-test kits being sold online and via WhatsApp at extremely low prices, and with no guarantee of the product being genuine.\n\nAs the ministry only has a general complaints page at https://eaduan.kpdnhep.gov.my/, MPS also suggested that a dedicated page be set up to enable complaints against fake products and sales by non-pharmacists and non-doctors.\n\n\"This would enable turnover of complaints to be handled quickly and efficiently by the ministry's enforcement arm,\" said Amrahi.\n\nHe added that it is critical that a mechanism to identify fake and genuine stock of self-test kits be implemented to further protect the public and suppliers of self-test kits, the ministry and the Malaysian Device Authority (MDA) should work on it immediately.\n\n\"In addition to all the above, the ministry should also help enforce the MDA's policy for conditional approval that allows only licensed pharmacies and healthcare facilities to sell self-test kits online with a proactive approach in barring runners and unqualified sellers from selling self-test kits, as they don\u2019t conform to MDA\u2019s prerequisites of stock-keeping and information sharing with customers,\" he said.", "keyword": ["pharmacists", "kits", "regulation",

David Marshel said DBKL was not looking at the big picture of the issue.\n\n\u201cDBKL should go after the stores that sell illegal and cheap liquor,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen you stop legitimate outlets from selling hard liquor, you will only create illegal ones that may very likely thrive.\n\n\u201cIllegal liquor is bottled to look like the genuine ones. They are sold in the black market.\u201d\n\nMarshel said instead of going after Chinese medicine halls and convenience stores, DBKL should ban the sale of hard liquor at sundry shops, which he said was easily accessible to youths, especially schoolchildren.\n\nAccepting the ruling\n\nMeanwhile the Kuala Lumpur chapter of Federation of Sundry Goods Merchants Association of Malaysia (FSGMAM) has decided not to appeal against DBKL\u2019s new liquor regulations.\n\n\n\nHong says FSGMAM will not appeal against DBKL\u2019s new hard liquor regulations once it comes into force.Its president Hong Chee Meng said the association found the multiple licences that they had to apply from various government agencies like DBKL as well as Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP), too cumbersome.\n\n\u201cRed tape aside, it is also expensive to renew the licence fees annually,\u201d Hong said.\n\n\u201cMany feel that the numerous checks by enforcement authorities such as DBKL, KPDNHEP, the police and Customs were taking its toll.\n\n\u201cThe general feedback from our members in Kuala Lumpur is that they will no longer sell hard liquor on their premises,\u201d he said, adding that in some states, the annual liquor licence fee was as high as RM5,000.\n\nFSGMAM has some 4,000 members nationwide with about 10,000 sundry shops. In Kuala Lumpur, there is slightly over 1,000 members. However, less than 20% sell hard liquor.\n\nDBKL started clamping down on the sale of liquor last June when Annuar called on it to stop issuing liquor licences.\n\nThe move was reportedly aimed at curbing cases of drink-driving but it had not gone down well with stakeholders who were not consulted about it.\n\nBased on DBKL\u2019s records, 2,400 liquor licences have been issued so far and the Excise Licensing Board of the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur (ELBKL) was looking at processing some 1,100 applications pending since 2019.\n\nA source from City Hall said the excise board would meet with members and Kuala Lumpur mayor Datuk Seri Mahadi Che Ngah soon, and a decision would be made on whether to implement or cancel the regulations.\n\n\u201cFrom what I hear, it\u2019s 50/50 right now, so anything can happen,\u201d added the source.\n\nELBKL chairman Datuk Jason Lau Beng Wei confirmed that a meeting was being planned to discuss the matter.\n\n\u201cFor now I have no comments but please bear with us on this,\u201d he said.", "keyword": ["liquor", "prior", "impose", "blanket", "dbkl", "ban", "hard", "sell", "association", "discussions", "sale", "chinese", "stakeholders", "decision", "shops", "appeal", "members"], "summary": "Effective Oct 1, they will no longer be allowed to sell hard liquor.\nThose who want to buy hard liquor can still do so at liquor shops, pubs, bars, restaurants as well as supermarkets and hypermarkets in shopping complexes.\nSeveral members expressed their disappointment last year when DBKL decided to impose the blanket ban on the sale of hard liquor without holding discussions with stakeholders.\n\u201cWhen you stop legitimate outlets from selling hard liquor, you will only create illegal ones that may very likely thrive.\nHowever, less than 20% sell hard liquor.", "news": "The Star Online", "date": "2021-08-16 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Toyota celebrates 50m Corollas sold worldwide", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWFsYXlzaWFucmVzZXJ2ZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wOC8xNy90b3lvdGEtY2VsZWJyYXRlcy01MG0tY29yb2xsYXMtc29sZC13b3JsZHdpZGUv0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVtYWxheXNpYW5yZXNlcnZlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA4LzE3L3RveW90YS1jZWxlYnJhdGVzLTUwbS1jb3JvbGxhcy1zb2xkLXdvcmxkd2lkZS9hbXAv?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://themalaysianreserve.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Toyota.jpg", "text": "by BERNAMA / pic by AFP\n\nKUALA LUMPUR \u2013 Japanese carmaker Toyota has sold 50 million units of its Corolla model worldwide with 300,000 sold in the Malaysian market to date.\n\nPresident of UMW Toyota Motor Ravindran K said the success of the model was due to it being a new standard of automotive excellence in this class of cars, offering customers a dynamic and advanced sedan with luxurious styling.\n\n\u201cEach generation, right from the very first, has been a contributor in the brand transformation.

For all of us to break the chain, the correct way of using the screening tool is very important.\n\n\u201cThe authenticity of the tool from the correct source is also very important. A false negative result will not help the current situation,\u201d she added.\n\nShe also disclosed that currently 11 types of saliva kits have been approved by Malaysia Ministry of Health.\n\n\u201cSo only purchase the kit approved by the Malaysia Ministry of Health.

This was despite Low not having any official 1MDB positions.\n\nMohd Hazem went on to assert his belief that Najib as the prime minister was part of Low\u2019s \u201cscheme\u201d for 1MDB, also claiming that Najib had allegedly known that 1MDB\u2019s funds had gone missing but that the then prime minister was purportedly putting on a \u201cdrama\u201d by allegedly pretending to enquire about the funds\u2019 status.\n\nMohd Hazem said all this while testifying as the 10th prosecution witness against Najib in the latter\u2019s trial involving more than RM2 billion of 1MDB funds.\n\nUnder cross-examination by Najib\u2019s lawyer Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah, Mohd Hazem agreed that former 1MDB senior management officials Terence Geh and Jasmine Loo were directly under Low\u2019s control and that he knew from the beginning when he became CEO that the duo\u2019s loyalty was only to Low and not to 1MDB. The two officials were supposed to be under Hazem\u2019s supervision as the CEO.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the two 1MDB officials acted solely at Low\u2019s direction and that they were not necessarily acting for the interests of 1MDB, Mohd Hazem said he did not do anything to avoid this situation as he equated Low and Najib together.\n\nShafee: Now I want to confront you with this important question, why didn\u2019t you do anything about it? Why didn\u2019t you at least bring this up to the board of directors?\n\nHazem: I think we go back to what I told before, they are the people of Jho Low, and Jho Low basically is the prime minister.\n\nWhen Shafee asked if he had attempt to clarify if Low was the actual alter ego of the then prime minister Najib, Hazem said he had spoke with 1MDB then chairman Tan Sri Lodin Wok Kamaruddin, 1MDB then director Tan Sri Ismee Ismail and Najib\u2019s then principal private secretary Datuk Azlin Alias. Hazem later said he had done his best to speak to the relevant personnel who have \u201cdirect access\u201d to the prime minister.\n\nHazem claimed that Lodin and the whole 1MDB board already knew that the company was being run by Low.\n\nAsked for what he specifically told Lodin about both Geh and Loo, Hazem said most of their conversations revolved around their \u201cconcerns of Jho Low handling 1MDB\u201d.\n\nHazem said that he had basically told Lodin about 1MDB being in Low\u2019s \u201chands\u201d and expressed concern over Low running or controlling the company, adding that Lodin had also shared the same concerns.\n\nAsked by Shafee, Hazem confirmed that he had never asked or suggested to Lodin for them to confirm with then PM Najib on what is Low\u2019s role and whether Low controlled 1MDB to the exclusion of Hazem as the CEO.\n\nShafee: But you agree the way you described Jho Low controlling the senior management, you were virtually not the CEO?\n\nHazem: Yes.\n\nShafee: Jho Low was running the company through the management?\n\nHazem: Yes, in a way.\n\nHazem confirmed that he did not suggest to Lodin for them to resolve this by checking with then prime minister Najib if this was how the company 1MDB is to operate, and that he did not take any other measures and did not know if Lodin had asked Najib about such issues.\n\nShafee then suggested that Hazem was making presumptions without evidence that \u201cJho Low is the prime minister and the prime minister is Jho Low\u201d and that Low\u2019s directions essentially came from Najib, but Hazem pointed to meetings where both Najib and Low were present regarding 1MDB matters.\n\nHazem specifically cited a November 28, 2013 meeting at Najib\u2019s house at Jalan Langgak Duta attended by 1MDB officials and BSI Singapore representative Yak Yew Chee, where Low was present and had started the meeting by briefing about 1MDB matters such as 1MDB\u2019s US$2.3 billion funds that were purportedly invested overseas under the custody of BSI Bank and what BSI Bank had told 1MDB auditor KPMG about the funds.\n\nWhen asked how the November 2013 meeting showed that directives from Low to 1MDB management are what Najib has directed, Hazem replied: \u201cThis is with regards to 1MDB, why would Jho Low need to be there?\u201d\n\nHazem later also pointed out that Low was an \u201cexternal party\u201d and had attending the meeting at the prime minister\u2019s house on 1MDB matters, saying that this was evidence that Low was representing Najib\u2019s interests: \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that he (Low) shouldn\u2019t be there at all. He was there and accepted in the meeting.\u201d\n\nHazem confirmed that he had never asked Najib on what Low\u2019s role was and how he was supposed to react as CEO.\n\nHazem had previously described Low as Najib\u2019s trusted right-hand man, proxy and special adviser for 1MDB.\n\nAbout the bonus\n\nShafee: You said truly you were not a CEO.\n\nHazem: Yes.\n\nShafee: You were virtually led by the nose with the greatest respect?\n\nHazem: Yes.\n\nHazem agreed with Shafee that he was concerned and ashamed at having being reduced to being impotent as a CEO and that this affected his pride, adding that he had very little control or no control over the matter.\n\nShafee then repeatedly grilled Hazem about the decision in a 1MDB board meeting on April 22, 2014 \u2014 which Hazem had excused himself from \u2014 to give him a bonus after the 1MDB remuneration committee assessed his performance as having \u201cexceeded expectations\u201d.\n\nShafee repeatedly questioned whether Hazem had felt ashamed for receiving a bonus on top of his monthly salary of more than RM90,000 when the company was allegedly going down the drain and when his pride was affected as he was led by the nose as a CEO.\n\nDeputy public prosecutor Akram Ahmad Gharib then said such questions were not relevant to the charges that Najib was facing and that Hazem had already answered that it was a decision made by the 1MDB board.\n\nShafee explained that he was trying to challenge Hazem\u2019s credibility: \u201cI\u2019m trying to show the inconsistent answers he has provided, namely on one hand he said he felt ashamed, his pride is affected because as a CEO he was completely not CEO, Jho Low was CEO, so he was not doing any work, he was just taking orders virtually, so if your pride is affected, naturally the question is why do you receive so much bonus and how do you feel?\u201d\n\nHazem later said he was not ashamed to have received his salary and bonus worth a combined RM2.9 million for the entire year of 2014 as he had done his job as required to meet targets set by the 1MDB board.\n\nHazem disagreed with Shafee\u2019s suggestion that he was purportedly shameless in receiving the salary and bonus as he was part of a purported conspiracy with Low to hoodwink 1MDB.\n\nWas it a \u2018drama\u2019?\n\nShafee highlighted the November 28, 2013 meeting at Najib\u2019s house and another meeting where Hazem was subsequently recorded as informing KPMG on another day that BSI Bank\u2019s Yak had assured the prime minister that 1MDB\u2019s US$2.3 billion investment was intact.\n\nHazem said he did not know for a fact at that point that the funds had disappeared, but had suspected that the funds \u201cprobably have disappeared\u201d.\n\nShafee then questioned why Hazem had not asked to speak privately to then prime minister Najib and share his suspicions about 1MDB funds to help save the company and the country, with Hazem then saying he believed Najib already knew the funds were gone.\n\nHazem: Because as far as I\u2019m concerned, the prime minister knows it, he is part of the scheme.\n\nShafee: The prime minister knows the money disappeared?\n\nHazem: From the very beginning I told you, the presence of Jho Low is the prime minister, that was what I was told.\n\nHazem however agreed he had never confirmed if Low was \u201ctruly the PM\u201d and agreed that he was making a presumption that Najib already knew the 1MDB funds were missing.\n\nShafee: Do you think Datuk Seri Najib, at that meeting, do you think Datuk Seri Najib when he asked for the assurance of the funds, he was being briefed about the funds, all those meetings, are you saying Datuk Seri Najib was pretending to ask all these questions because he knows the money disappeared?\n\nHazem: I won\u2019t answer on his behalf.\n\nShafee: I\u2019m asking you, are you saying Datuk Seri Najib when he was being briefed about the funds, it was all a drama by Datuk Seri Najib?\n\nHazem: Yes.\n\nHazem later disagreed with Shafee\u2019s suggestion that it was not Najib trying to put on a drama about the 1MDB funds, and disagreed that it was Hazem, Yak and Low trying to put on the alleged drama to impress Najib and 1MDB board members.\n\nNajib\u2019s 1MDB trial before High Court judge Collin Lawrence Sequerah resumes tomorrow morning. \u2014 Malay Mail", "keyword": ["low",

Not least because, in essence, there was nothing innovative about it.\n\nIn the 1970s, Apple, Atari and Commodore were already producing computer models. But the strength of the IBM PC lay mainly in its ability to outsource the production of its components to other companies.\n\nAs soon as it was released, the company decided to publish the design and software code of the model, allowing other players in the sector to design compatible products.\n\nIn the IBM PC, the processor was an Intel 8088, the floppy drive was from Tandon, and the operating system was Microsoft\u2019s QDOS. IBM, on the other hand, supplied only the monitor, keyboard, and system unit.\n\nLittle by little, the personal computer became more commonplace in homes, whereas its predecessors had failed to earn mass acceptance.\n\nAnd in 1983, Time magazine awarded it the prize for machine of the year, even though the award is generally used to celebrate people.\n\nBacklash to the rapid success\n\nBut the price of fame turned out to be higher than expected. Indeed, in order to be competitive and put out a large quantity, IBM assembled the 5150 prototype in a hurry, without much verification afterwards.\n\nMeanwhile, Bill Gates\u2019s Microsoft, a newcomer to the operating system market, had set about establishing a dominant position.\n\nOther companies, such as Compaq, Dell or HP, were also starting to manufacture personal computers, more or less legally with respect to IBM.\n\nWithin a short time, competitors took over the PC market. In 2005, IBM sold its PC production business to Lenovo for US$1.3 billion.

But until then, he had a chance to form a government.\n\nDodging The Bullet\n\nAzhar Azizan Harun.\n\nAlmost immediately there were reports of the 14th Parliamentary Assembly sitting being postponed to May 18. It then became a single day sitting to hear the speech by the Yang di-Pertuan. There. There will be no meeting.\n\nDue to the Covid-19 dangers at the time, a Parliamentary meeting was set for 13 July instead. It was during this meeting that Mahiaddin flexed his support by narrowly clearing a major political test to remove the lower house speaker.\n\nDatuk Azhar Azizan Harun was installed as Dewan Rakyat Speaker after a lunch break without a vote from MPs. The move brought ire from the opposition.\n\nAll motions for a confidence vote were unlikely to happen.\n\nThe Third Wave\n\nElement5 Digital / Unsplash\n\nCovid-19 cases in Malaysia were low. The country was considered one of the best countries in the world to have handled the pandemic. It sustained the people\u2019s confidence in Mahiaddin. But then, a misstep\u2026\n\nThe Sabah state election (26 September to 12 October 2020) resulted in a third wave of Covid-19 cases as people from across the country went there to campaign and then returned home.\n\nAfterwards, the government scrambled to contain the outbreak by imposing a conditional movement order in Sabah and selected states.\n\nThe Hail Mary\n\nAs the number of cases increased, Mahiaddin\u2019s popularity waned. Nothing he did, from the ever-changing MCO and National Recovery Plan to Financial Assistance and SOPs, seemed to work.\n\nAll the while Mahiaddin was operating as the Prime Minister without a deputy. Some speculated that it was done to prevent votes for him from splintering.\n\nThat changed this year (2021) on 7 July when he named Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob as his deputy and Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein as a Senior Minister. A move, some say, was done to placate UMNO and for Mahiaddin to retain a majority.\n\nThe Fumble\n\nParliament, 26 July 2021\n\nOn 26 July 2021, Parliament and Law Minister Datuk Seri Takiyuddin Hassan, stated that Emergency Ordinances, which had been in place since 11 January, were retracted on 21 July.\n\nThe statement was then rebuked by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong who holds the Constitutional right to enact and repeal the Emergency Ordinance.\n\nThe issue fractured Mahiaddin\u2019s already fragile alliance. Because of it, two Ministers and about a dozen MPs pulled their support for the Prime Minister and the opposition challenged his majority.\n\nOn 13 August, Mahiaddin extended an olive branch to the opposition. He promised a General Election, a cross-party framework, and additional funds. But, it did not work. Some even looked at it as a bribe.\n\nToday (16 August), after less than two years, Mahiaddin has resigned his position as Prime Minister.\n\nLet us know on TRP\u2019s Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram!", "keyword": ["months", "malaysias", "17", "8th", "resigned", "installed", "agong", "cases", "mahiaddin", "minister", "prime", "dipertuan", "parliament", "election", "political", "vote"], "summary": "Tan Sri Mahiaddin Md Yasin, also known as Muhyiddin Yassin, had the unenviable task of being the Prime Minister of Malaysia during an unprecedented global pandemic.\nWe have covered his political journey up to when he became the Prime Minister on 29 February 2020.\nThe statement was then rebuked by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong who holds the Constitutional right to enact and repeal the Emergency Ordinance.\nBecause of it, two Ministers and about a dozen MPs pulled their support for the Prime Minister and the opposition challenged his majority.\nToday (16 August), after less than two years, Mahiaddin has resigned his position as Prime Minister.", "news": "The Rakyat Post", "date": "2021-08-16 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Buy And Sell Artisanal Goods On This Uniquely Malaysian e-Commerce Platform", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL2xpdmluZy8yMDIxLzA4LzE4L2J1eS1hbmQtc2VsbC1hcnRpc2FuYWwtZ29vZHMtb24tdGhpcy11bmlxdWVseS1tYWxheXNpYW4tZS1jb21tZXJjZS1wbGF0Zm9ybS_SAYABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlcmFreWF0cG9zdC5jb20vbGl2aW5nLzIwMjEvMDgvMTgvYnV5LWFuZC1zZWxsLWFydGlzYW5hbC1nb29kcy1vbi10aGlzLXVuaXF1ZWx5LW1hbGF5c2lhbi1lLWNvbW1lcmNlLXBsYXRmb3JtL2FtcC8?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Maya Suraya", "Azizul Rahman Ismail"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/TAHFI1.jpg", "text": "Subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates.\n\nThe Artisans Haven (TAH) is an online platform that showcases talented Malaysian artisans and their handmade products.\n\nFirst formed in September 2020, TAH was created as an answer to individuals who suddenly lost their jobs due to Covid-19 and had turned to the handmade artisan sector as a financial lifeline.\n\nAccording to Rosalie Lin, Brand & PR Advisory and co-Founder of TAH, what makes their platform different from other e-Commerce sites is how dedicated the team are to tell the story behind particular products and the sellers behind them.\n\nAnother distinctive feature is also how nothing is ever the same on the platform as most things are handmade, and can be customised to your preference \u2013 like a painting of your pet.\n\nA boost in confidence\n\nJade Lee, CEO and Co-Founder of TAH has made it the company\u2019s mission to boost the confidence of local artisans and micro-entrepreneurs.\n\nOne such entrepreneur is Aesos Lai, who used to run a souvenir gift shop and durian-centric caf\u00e9 at tourist hot spot Central Market.

Thus, he urged the government to manage the sales and distribution of self-test kits efficiently via subsidisation or price control mechanisms, and immediately curb and end sales of fake kits as well as sales by unqualified sellers.\n\n\n\nIn view of potential price control mechanisms, MPS suggested that the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) give a one-month grace period

must ensure price controls include not only standardisation of the sales price but also control of the cost price from the supplier,\u201d Amrahi noted.\n\nHe said this is because MPS has received numerous complaints from the public and pharmacists that self-test kits are being sold online and via WhatsApp at extremely low prices and with no guarantee of the product being genuine.\n\nAs KPDNHEP

These expanded measures will take effect today (16 August 2021).\n\n\u201cThe government understands that many personal activities have been disrupted as a result of this pandemic. This includes buying household items and doing basic upkeep like haircuts. The government is aware, the longer this is restricted, the greater the risk to the mental and physical health of the people,\u201d PM Muhyiddin said.\n\nThe government also sees that, he added, it is very important for economic sectors to reopen in stages because if the situation persists, the impact especially on business owners and their employees will be worse.\n\nThe latest series of updates are explained in detail below, and cover the following:\n\nThe 11 more sectors allowed to operate in Phase One of National Recovery Plan\n\nThe additional 11 sectors allowed to operate in Phase Two of National Recovery Plan\n\nManufacturing, construction, mining, and quarrying activities to resume, based on percentage of fully-vaccinated workforce\n\nVisiting parks for exercising and for recreational activities to be allowed (for individual activities only)\n\nPlans for travel bubble to pilot with Langkawi Island\n\nScroll below for the updates.\n\nUpdates to Phase One of National Recovery Plan\n\nIn that regard, for states under Phase One of NRP, there are 11 business sectors that are allowed to operate, effective 16 August 2021. They are:\n\nCar wash; Electrical and electronics stores; Household goods and kitchen utensils; Furniture stores; Sports equipment stores; Car accessories stores; Car distribution and sales centre; Morning and farmers\u2019 markets; Clothing, fashion, and accessories stores; Jewellery stores, and Hairdressers and beauty salons (for basic barber services only).\n\nThis decision came after the government assessed the pandemic situation with the risk assessment data conducted by the Ministry of Health Malaysia (MOH), Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) and \u201cafter discussing with all stakeholders in the sectors of interest\u201d.\n\nThe Prime Minister also noted that for clothing, fashion, and accessory stores; jewellery stores; as well as barbershops and beauty salons, there are additional health SOPs that must be adhered to.\n\n\u201cThis includes wearing gloves, limiting business time between employees and customers and not allowing the use of fitting rooms. These SOPs may be complicated but they are for the safety of employees and customers.\n\n\u201cOwners of premises listed in the business that can re-operate must also ensure that customers who enter the premises must show a COVID-19 digital vaccination certificate to prove that the individual has received a complete vaccination,\u201d PM Muhyiddin said.\n\nUpdates to Phase Two of National Recovery Plan\n\nFor states in Phase Two of NRP, an additional 11 business sectors will be allowed to operate (over and above those listed in Phase One), effective 16 August 2021. They are:\n\nPhotographic goods store and photographic services; Second-hand items; Florists and nurseries; Handicraft and souvenir stores; Antique stores; Toy stores; Carpet stores; Creative content and creative industry equipment stores; Outdoor equipment stores (including camping, fishing and other equipment); Cosmetics, skin care, and perfume stores, and Tobacco stores (including vape and electronic cigarettes).\n\n\u201cOwners of premises listed have to ensure that customers who enter the premises must show a COVID-19 digital vaccination certificate to prove that the individual has received a complete vaccination,\u201d the Prime Minister reiterated.\n\nManufacturing, construction, mining, and quarrying activities to resume\n\n\u201cI would also like to inform that the government has agreed to allow all non-essential activities in the manufacturing, construction, mining and quarrying sectors to resume operations from 16 August 2021 in states that are under Phase One, Two, and Three of NRP.\n\n\u201cHowever, the operating capacity depends on the rate of complete vaccination of the workers,\u201d PM Muhyiddin said.\n\nThis translates into the following:\n\nShould the manufacturing, construction, mining and quarrying business have 80% to 100% of employees fully-vaccinated, then they are allowed to operate with 100% capacity.\n\nSimilarly, for 60% to 79% of employees fully-vaccinated, then operating capacity is at 80%;\n\nFinally, for 40% to 59% of fully-vaccinated workforce, then operating capacity is at 60%.\n\nFurther, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) reminded that companies are required to declare the number and names of their fully-vaccinated employees in the COVID-19 Intelligent Management System (CIMS) 3.0 system.\n\nUpon declaration, the company may directly download the latest approval letter from the system to operate.\n\nThe government understands, PM Muhyiddin noted, this decision will provoke various reactions from the public who are concerned about the risk of contagion. He reassured that this decision is \u201cmade with care\u201d, and that it is necessary because \u201cmany employers began to reduce the workforce, causing many to lose their jobs\u201d - and the government cannot allow this situation to continue.\n\nPM Muhyiddin added: \u201cI would like to remind all employers to comply with and meet the conditions that have been set before resuming operations to ensure the safety of employees and secure work. At the same time, take full advantage of the wage subsidy initiatives provided by the Government to ensure that every employee receives their salary payment.\u201d\n\nVisiting parks for exercising and for recreational activities\n\nBeyond the economic aspect of Malaysia, the Prime Minister also announced more measures to boost the nation\u2019s mental wellbeing. This is by allowing locals in states under Phase One of NRP to visit parks for exercising and for recreational activities.\n\n\u201cBut remember, only activities that can be done individually such as jogging, cycling and exercising are allowed, in line with the sports and leisure SOPs in Phase One of NRP,\u201d PM Muhyiddin said.\n\nHe added that the public is also only allowed to visit public recreational parks in the neighbourhood; not to cross states, or regions to go to other recreational parks. Local authorities and agencies will monitor the situation, and ensure that health SOPs are adhered to.\n\nPlans for travel bubble to pilot with Langkawi Island\n\nIn his speech, PM Muhyiddin also spoke of the government\u2019s plans to implement a travel bubble at Langkawi Island. This will be a pilot project for the fully-vaccinated, and will be crucial to \u201crevive the tourism industry.\u201d\n\nHe shared that the Ministry of Health (MOH) and health experts have advised the government to implement this plan only when the complete vaccination rate of the population of Langkawi Island reaches at least 80% of the total population.\n\nAs of 15 August 2021, however, according to the COVID-19 Vaccine Supply Assurance Special Committee (Jawatankuasa Khas Jaminan Akses Bekalan Vaksin COVID-19/JKJAV), the nation\u2019s vaccination rate is at 45.9% (with two doses) and at 72.9% (with one dose).\n\nApart from Langkawi Island, PM Muhyiddin said, the government also has plans to implement a tourism bubble approach in more destinations, other than Langkawi Island, throughout the country.\n\n\u201cHowever, this matter is still at the planning stage and the government will look at the results of the pilot project (Langkawi Island) first. If all goes well, the tourism bubble will be implemented more widely,\u201d the Prime Minister added.\n\nAlso read: SOPs for fully-vaccinated individuals in Malaysia: Phases 1, 2 and 3 of NRP [Aug

self-test kits and wrong use of these kits would produce inaccurate results such as false negatives that would not help in combating the pandemic.\n\n\"Furthermore, with more cases of BID, the government needs to act immediately before the situation worsens,\" he said in a statement on Thursday (Aug 19).\n\nHe added that ideally, self-test kits should be provided free to the public, but if the government is not able to do so, a mechanism to subsidise the cost should be put into place.\n\nThus, MPS is urging the government to manage the sales and distribution of self-test kits efficiently via subsidisation or price control mechanisms, and immediately curb and end sales of fake kits, as well as sales by unqualified sellers.\n\nIn view of potential price control mechanisms, MPS advised the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry to give a grace period of one month before implementation as the move would assist pharmacists who have already purchased the self-test kits at a higher cost to clear the more expensive stock.\n\n\"In the event a grace period is not granted, MPS wants a subsidy or refund mechanism to be put in place to avoid losses to pharmacists who purchased the stocks in good faith.\n\n\"In ensuring price controls benefit the public, the ministry must ensure price controls include not only standardisation of the sales price, but also control of the cost price from the supplier,\" he said.\n\nThis is because MPS has received numerous complaints from the public and from pharmacists of self-test kits being sold online and via WhatsApp at extremely low prices, and with no guarantee of the product being genuine.\n\nAs the ministry only has a general complaints page at https://eaduan.kpdnhep.gov.my/, MPS also suggested that a dedicated page be set up to enable complaints against fake products and sales by non-pharmacists and non-doctors.\n\n\"This would enable turnover of complaints to be handled quickly and efficiently by the ministry's enforcement arm,\" said Amrahi.\n\nHe added that it is critical that a mechanism to identify fake and genuine stock of self-test kits be implemented to further protect the public and suppliers of self-test kits, the ministry and the Malaysian Device Authority (MDA) should work on it immediately.\n\n\"In addition to all the above, the ministry should also help enforce the MDA's policy for conditional approval that allows only licensed pharmacies and healthcare facilities to sell self-test kits online with a proactive approach in barring runners and unqualified sellers from selling self-test kits, as they don\u2019t conform to MDA\u2019s prerequisites of stock-keeping and information sharing with customers,\" he said.", "keyword": ["pharmacists", "kits", "regulation",

David Marshel said DBKL was not looking at the big picture of the issue.\n\n\u201cDBKL should go after the stores that sell illegal and cheap liquor,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen you stop legitimate outlets from selling hard liquor, you will only create illegal ones that may very likely thrive.\n\n\u201cIllegal liquor is bottled to look like the genuine ones. They are sold in the black market.\u201d\n\nMarshel said instead of going after Chinese medicine halls and convenience stores, DBKL should ban the sale of hard liquor at sundry shops, which he said was easily accessible to youths, especially schoolchildren.\n\nAccepting the ruling\n\nMeanwhile the Kuala Lumpur chapter of Federation of Sundry Goods Merchants Association of Malaysia (FSGMAM) has decided not to appeal against DBKL\u2019s new liquor regulations.\n\n\n\nHong says FSGMAM will not appeal against DBKL\u2019s new hard liquor regulations once it comes into force.Its president Hong Chee Meng said the association found the multiple licences that they had to apply from various government agencies like DBKL as well as Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP), too cumbersome.\n\n\u201cRed tape aside, it is also expensive to renew the licence fees annually,\u201d Hong said.\n\n\u201cMany feel that the numerous checks by enforcement authorities such as DBKL, KPDNHEP, the police and Customs were taking its toll.\n\n\u201cThe general feedback from our members in Kuala Lumpur is that they will no longer sell hard liquor on their premises,\u201d he said, adding that in some states, the annual liquor licence fee was as high as RM5,000.\n\nFSGMAM has some 4,000 members nationwide with about 10,000 sundry shops. In Kuala Lumpur, there is slightly over 1,000 members. However, less than 20% sell hard liquor.\n\nDBKL started clamping down on the sale of liquor last June when Annuar called on it to stop issuing liquor licences.\n\nThe move was reportedly aimed at curbing cases of drink-driving but it had not gone down well with stakeholders who were not consulted about it.\n\nBased on DBKL\u2019s records, 2,400 liquor licences have been issued so far and the Excise Licensing Board of the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur (ELBKL) was looking at processing some 1,100 applications pending since 2019.\n\nA source from City Hall said the excise board would meet with members and Kuala Lumpur mayor Datuk Seri Mahadi Che Ngah soon, and a decision would be made on whether to implement or cancel the regulations.\n\n\u201cFrom what I hear, it\u2019s 50/50 right now, so anything can happen,\u201d added the source.\n\nELBKL chairman Datuk Jason Lau Beng Wei confirmed that a meeting was being planned to discuss the matter.\n\n\u201cFor now I have no comments but please bear with us on this,\u201d he said.", "keyword": ["liquor", "prior", "impose", "blanket", "dbkl", "ban", "hard", "sell", "association", "discussions", "sale", "chinese", "stakeholders", "decision", "shops", "appeal", "members"], "summary": "Effective Oct 1, they will no longer be allowed to sell hard liquor.\nThose who want to buy hard liquor can still do so at liquor shops, pubs, bars, restaurants as well as supermarkets and hypermarkets in shopping complexes.\nSeveral members expressed their disappointment last year when DBKL decided to impose the blanket ban on the sale of hard liquor without holding discussions with stakeholders.\n\u201cWhen you stop legitimate outlets from selling hard liquor, you will only create illegal ones that may very likely thrive.\nHowever, less than 20% sell hard liquor.", "news": "The Star Online", "date": "2021-08-16 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Toyota celebrates 50m Corollas sold worldwide", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWFsYXlzaWFucmVzZXJ2ZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wOC8xNy90b3lvdGEtY2VsZWJyYXRlcy01MG0tY29yb2xsYXMtc29sZC13b3JsZHdpZGUv0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVtYWxheXNpYW5yZXNlcnZlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA4LzE3L3RveW90YS1jZWxlYnJhdGVzLTUwbS1jb3JvbGxhcy1zb2xkLXdvcmxkd2lkZS9hbXAv?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://themalaysianreserve.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Toyota.jpg", "text": "by BERNAMA / pic by AFP\n\nKUALA LUMPUR \u2013 Japanese carmaker Toyota has sold 50 million units of its Corolla model worldwide with 300,000 sold in the Malaysian market to date.\n\nPresident of UMW Toyota Motor Ravindran K said the success of the model was due to it being a new standard of automotive excellence in this class of cars, offering customers a dynamic and advanced sedan with luxurious styling.\n\n\u201cEach generation, right from the very first, has been a contributor in the brand transformation.

This was despite Low not having any official 1MDB positions.\n\nMohd Hazem went on to assert his belief that Najib as the prime minister was part of Low\u2019s \u201cscheme\u201d for 1MDB, also claiming that Najib had allegedly known that 1MDB\u2019s funds had gone missing but that the then prime minister was purportedly putting on a \u201cdrama\u201d by allegedly pretending to enquire about the funds\u2019 status.\n\nMohd Hazem said all this while testifying as the 10th prosecution witness against Najib in the latter\u2019s trial involving more than RM2 billion of 1MDB funds.\n\nUnder cross-examination by Najib\u2019s lawyer Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah, Mohd Hazem agreed that former 1MDB senior management officials Terence Geh and Jasmine Loo were directly under Low\u2019s control and that he knew from the beginning when he became CEO that the duo\u2019s loyalty was only to Low and not to 1MDB. The two officials were supposed to be under Hazem\u2019s supervision as the CEO.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the two 1MDB officials acted solely at Low\u2019s direction and that they were not necessarily acting for the interests of 1MDB, Mohd Hazem said he did not do anything to avoid this situation as he equated Low and Najib together.\n\nShafee: Now I want to confront you with this important question, why didn\u2019t you do anything about it? Why didn\u2019t you at least bring this up to the board of directors?\n\nHazem: I think we go back to what I told before, they are the people of Jho Low, and Jho Low basically is the prime minister.\n\nWhen Shafee asked if he had attempt to clarify if Low was the actual alter ego of the then prime minister Najib, Hazem said he had spoke with 1MDB then chairman Tan Sri Lodin Wok Kamaruddin, 1MDB then director Tan Sri Ismee Ismail and Najib\u2019s then principal private secretary Datuk Azlin Alias. Hazem later said he had done his best to speak to the relevant personnel who have \u201cdirect access\u201d to the prime minister.\n\nHazem claimed that Lodin and the whole 1MDB board already knew that the company was being run by Low.\n\nAsked for what he specifically told Lodin about both Geh and Loo, Hazem said most of their conversations revolved around their \u201cconcerns of Jho Low handling 1MDB\u201d.\n\nHazem said that he had basically told Lodin about 1MDB being in Low\u2019s \u201chands\u201d and expressed concern over Low running or controlling the company, adding that Lodin had also shared the same concerns.\n\nAsked by Shafee, Hazem confirmed that he had never asked or suggested to Lodin for them to confirm with then PM Najib on what is Low\u2019s role and whether Low controlled 1MDB to the exclusion of Hazem as the CEO.\n\nShafee: But you agree the way you described Jho Low controlling the senior management, you were virtually not the CEO?\n\nHazem: Yes.\n\nShafee: Jho Low was running the company through the management?\n\nHazem: Yes, in a way.\n\nHazem confirmed that he did not suggest to Lodin for them to resolve this by checking with then prime minister Najib if this was how the company 1MDB is to operate, and that he did not take any other measures and did not know if Lodin had asked Najib about such issues.\n\nShafee then suggested that Hazem was making presumptions without evidence that \u201cJho Low is the prime minister and the prime minister is Jho Low\u201d and that Low\u2019s directions essentially came from Najib, but Hazem pointed to meetings where both Najib and Low were present regarding 1MDB matters.\n\nHazem specifically cited a November 28, 2013 meeting at Najib\u2019s house at Jalan Langgak Duta attended by 1MDB officials and BSI Singapore representative Yak Yew Chee, where Low was present and had started the meeting by briefing about 1MDB matters such as 1MDB\u2019s US$2.3 billion funds that were purportedly invested overseas under the custody of BSI Bank and what BSI Bank had told 1MDB auditor KPMG about the funds.\n\nWhen asked how the November 2013 meeting showed that directives from Low to 1MDB management are what Najib has directed, Hazem replied: \u201cThis is with regards to 1MDB, why would Jho Low need to be there?\u201d\n\nHazem later also pointed out that Low was an \u201cexternal party\u201d and had attending the meeting at the prime minister\u2019s house on 1MDB matters, saying that this was evidence that Low was representing Najib\u2019s interests: \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that he (Low) shouldn\u2019t be there at all. He was there and accepted in the meeting.\u201d\n\nHazem confirmed that he had never asked Najib on what Low\u2019s role was and how he was supposed to react as CEO.\n\nHazem had previously described Low as Najib\u2019s trusted right-hand man, proxy and special adviser for 1MDB.\n\nAbout the bonus\n\nShafee: You said truly you were not a CEO.\n\nHazem: Yes.\n\nShafee: You were virtually led by the nose with the greatest respect?\n\nHazem: Yes.\n\nHazem agreed with Shafee that he was concerned and ashamed at having being reduced to being impotent as a CEO and that this affected his pride, adding that he had very little control or no control over the matter.\n\nShafee then repeatedly grilled Hazem about the decision in a 1MDB board meeting on April 22, 2014 \u2014 which Hazem had excused himself from \u2014 to give him a bonus after the 1MDB remuneration committee assessed his performance as having \u201cexceeded expectations\u201d.\n\nShafee repeatedly questioned whether Hazem had felt ashamed for receiving a bonus on top of his monthly salary of more than RM90,000 when the company was allegedly going down the drain and when his pride was affected as he was led by the nose as a CEO.\n\nDeputy public prosecutor Akram Ahmad Gharib then said such questions were not relevant to the charges that Najib was facing and that Hazem had already answered that it was a decision made by the 1MDB board.\n\nShafee explained that he was trying to challenge Hazem\u2019s credibility: \u201cI\u2019m trying to show the inconsistent answers he has provided, namely on one hand he said he felt ashamed, his pride is affected because as a CEO he was completely not CEO, Jho Low was CEO, so he was not doing any work, he was just taking orders virtually, so if your pride is affected, naturally the question is why do you receive so much bonus and how do you feel?\u201d\n\nHazem later said he was not ashamed to have received his salary and bonus worth a combined RM2.9 million for the entire year of 2014 as he had done his job as required to meet targets set by the 1MDB board.\n\nHazem disagreed with Shafee\u2019s suggestion that he was purportedly shameless in receiving the salary and bonus as he was part of a purported conspiracy with Low to hoodwink 1MDB.\n\nWas it a \u2018drama\u2019?\n\nShafee highlighted the November 28, 2013 meeting at Najib\u2019s house and another meeting where Hazem was subsequently recorded as informing KPMG on another day that BSI Bank\u2019s Yak had assured the prime minister that 1MDB\u2019s US$2.3 billion investment was intact.\n\nHazem said he did not know for a fact at that point that the funds had disappeared, but had suspected that the funds \u201cprobably have disappeared\u201d.\n\nShafee then questioned why Hazem had not asked to speak privately to then prime minister Najib and share his suspicions about 1MDB funds to help save the company and the country, with Hazem then saying he believed Najib already knew the funds were gone.\n\nHazem: Because as far as I\u2019m concerned, the prime minister knows it, he is part of the scheme.\n\nShafee: The prime minister knows the money disappeared?\n\nHazem: From the very beginning I told you, the presence of Jho Low is the prime minister, that was what I was told.\n\nHazem however agreed he had never confirmed if Low was \u201ctruly the PM\u201d and agreed that he was making a presumption that Najib already knew the 1MDB funds were missing.\n\nShafee: Do you think Datuk Seri Najib, at that meeting, do you think Datuk Seri Najib when he asked for the assurance of the funds, he was being briefed about the funds, all those meetings, are you saying Datuk Seri Najib was pretending to ask all these questions because he knows the money disappeared?\n\nHazem: I won\u2019t answer on his behalf.\n\nShafee: I\u2019m asking you, are you saying Datuk Seri Najib when he was being briefed about the funds, it was all a drama by Datuk Seri Najib?\n\nHazem: Yes.\n\nHazem later disagreed with Shafee\u2019s suggestion that it was not Najib trying to put on a drama about the 1MDB funds, and disagreed that it was Hazem, Yak and Low trying to put on the alleged drama to impress Najib and 1MDB board members.\n\nNajib\u2019s 1MDB trial before High Court judge Collin Lawrence Sequerah resumes tomorrow morning. \u2014 Malay Mail", "keyword": ["low",

Muhyiddin Yassin (pix) said he had made various efforts till the last minute in a bid to keep the Perikatan Nasional (PN) government intact, at least until it had completed its duty in managing the Covid-19 pandemic and reviving the economy.\n\nHowever, he said his efforts were unsuccessful because certain parties were greedy in trying to grab power without considering its impact on the people\u2019s lives and livelihoods.\n\n\u201cTo me, what has happened is the will of Allah s.w.t. which is an episode in the history of my political struggle,\u201d he said in a special address on local television today.\n\nMuhyiddin said he had tendered his resignation as the prime minister and that of the whole Cabinet to the Yang di-Pertuan Agong in accordance with Article 43(4) of the Federal Constitution because he had lost majority support in the Dewan Rakyat.\n\nMuhyiddin said he had initially proposed to use Parliament to determine his legitimacy as prime minister but decided to resign after 15 Umno Members of Parliament withdrew support for him and the opposition rejected his offer of cross-party cooperation.\n\n\u201cI heard the sincere appeal of millions of Malaysians for me to carry on and not to resign.

IBM, on the other hand, supplied only the monitor, keyboard, and system unit.\n\nLittle by little, the personal computer became more commonplace in homes, whereas its predecessors had failed to earn mass acceptance.\n\nAnd in 1983, Time magazine awarded it the prize for machine of the year, even though the award is generally used to celebrate people.\n\nBacklash to the rapid success\n\nBut the price of fame turned out to be higher than expected. Indeed, in order to be competitive and put out a large quantity, IBM assembled the 5150 prototype in a hurry, without much verification afterwards.\n\nMeanwhile, Bill Gates\u2019s Microsoft, a newcomer to the operating system market, had set about establishing a dominant position.\n\nOther companies, such as Compaq, Dell or HP, were also starting to manufacture personal computers, more or less legally with respect to IBM.\n\nWithin a short time, competitors took over the PC market.

covered his political journey up to when he became the Prime Minister on 29 February 2020.\n\nREAD MORE: The Dark Horse of Malaysian Politics: Muhyiddin Yassin\n\nHowever, let\u2019s take a look at how he got to where he is today and the political scheme of things that have led to him tendering his resignation as the eighth Prime Minister of Malaysia.\n\nWhere The Troubles Began\n\nMahiaddin being sworn in.\n\nAt 72, Mahiaddin was sworn in as Prime Minister by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong on 1 March 2020 after a week of uncertainty following the collapse of Pakatan Harapan government that was led by Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad.\n\nThe Yang di-Pertuan Agong Al-Sultan Abdullah Ri\u2019ayatuddin Al-Mustafa Billah Shah intervened to solve the deadlock by consulting with all Members of Parliament one-by-one in private, before appointing Mahiaddin as the Prime Minister.\n\nAs he was put into the position without a general election or public vote, there was still a chance that Mahiaddin could be replaced when Parliament convened on 9 March 2020. But until then, he had a chance to form a government.\n\nDodging The Bullet\n\nAzhar Azizan Harun.\n\nAlmost immediately there were reports of the 14th Parliamentary Assembly sitting being postponed to May 18. It then became a single day sitting to hear the speech by the Yang di-Pertuan. There. There will be no meeting.\n\nDue to the Covid-19 dangers at the time, a Parliamentary meeting was set for 13 July instead. It was during this meeting that Mahiaddin flexed his support by narrowly clearing a major political test to remove the lower house speaker.\n\nDatuk Azhar Azizan Harun was installed as Dewan Rakyat Speaker after a lunch break without a vote from MPs. The move brought ire from the opposition.\n\nAll motions for a confidence vote were unlikely to happen.\n\nThe Third Wave\n\nElement5 Digital / Unsplash\n\nCovid-19 cases in Malaysia were low. The country was considered one of the best countries in the world to have handled the pandemic. It sustained the people\u2019s confidence in Mahiaddin. But then, a misstep\u2026\n\nThe Sabah state election (26 September to 12 October 2020) resulted in a third wave of Covid-19 cases as people from across the country went there to campaign and then returned home.\n\nAfterwards, the government scrambled to contain the outbreak by imposing a conditional movement order in Sabah and selected states.\n\nThe Hail Mary\n\nAs the number of cases increased, Mahiaddin\u2019s popularity waned. Nothing he did, from the ever-changing MCO and National Recovery Plan to Financial Assistance and SOPs, seemed to work.\n\nAll the while Mahiaddin was operating as the Prime Minister without a deputy. Some speculated that it was done to prevent votes for him from splintering.\n\nThat changed this year (2021) on 7 July when he named Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob as his deputy and Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein as a Senior Minister. A move, some say, was done to placate UMNO and for Mahiaddin to retain a majority.\n\nThe Fumble\n\nParliament, 26 July 2021\n\nOn 26 July 2021, Parliament and Law Minister Datuk Seri Takiyuddin Hassan, stated that Emergency Ordinances, which had been in place since 11 January, were retracted on 21 July.\n\nThe statement was then rebuked by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong who holds the Constitutional right to enact and repeal the Emergency Ordinance.\n\nThe issue fractured Mahiaddin\u2019s already fragile alliance. Because of it, two Ministers and about a dozen MPs pulled their support for the Prime Minister and the opposition challenged his majority.\n\nOn 13 August, Mahiaddin extended an olive branch to the opposition. He promised a General Election, a cross-party framework, and additional funds. But, it did not work. Some even looked at it as a bribe.\n\nToday (16 August), after less than two years, Mahiaddin has resigned his position as Prime Minister.\n\nLet us know on TRP\u2019s Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram!", "keyword": ["months", "malaysias", "17", "8th", "resigned", "installed", "agong", "cases", "mahiaddin", "minister", "prime", "dipertuan", "parliament", "election", "political", "vote"], "summary": "Tan Sri Mahiaddin Md Yasin, also known as Muhyiddin Yassin, had the unenviable task of being the Prime Minister of Malaysia during an unprecedented global pandemic.\nWe have covered his political journey up to when he became the Prime Minister on 29 February 2020.\nThe statement was then rebuked by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong who holds the Constitutional right to enact and repeal the Emergency Ordinance.\nBecause of it, two Ministers and about a dozen MPs pulled their support for the Prime Minister and the opposition challenged his majority.\nToday (16 August), after less than two years, Mahiaddin has resigned his position as Prime Minister.", "news": "The Rakyat Post", "date": "2021-08-16 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Buy And Sell Artisanal Goods On This Uniquely Malaysian e-Commerce Platform", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL2xpdmluZy8yMDIxLzA4LzE4L2J1eS1hbmQtc2VsbC1hcnRpc2FuYWwtZ29vZHMtb24tdGhpcy11bmlxdWVseS1tYWxheXNpYW4tZS1jb21tZXJjZS1wbGF0Zm9ybS_SAYABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlcmFreWF0cG9zdC5jb20vbGl2aW5nLzIwMjEvMDgvMTgvYnV5LWFuZC1zZWxsLWFydGlzYW5hbC1nb29kcy1vbi10aGlzLXVuaXF1ZWx5LW1hbGF5c2lhbi1lLWNvbW1lcmNlLXBsYXRmb3JtL2FtcC8?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Maya Suraya", "Azizul Rahman Ismail"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/TAHFI1.jpg", "text": "Subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates.\n\nThe Artisans Haven (TAH) is an online platform that showcases talented Malaysian artisans and their handmade products.\n\nFirst formed in September 2020, TAH was created as an answer to individuals who suddenly lost their jobs due to Covid-19 and had turned to the handmade artisan sector as a financial lifeline.\n\nAccording to Rosalie Lin, Brand & PR Advisory and co-Founder of TAH, what makes their platform different from other e-Commerce sites is how dedicated the team are to tell the story behind particular products and the sellers behind them.\n\nAnother distinctive feature is also how nothing is ever the same on the platform as most things are handmade, and can be customised to your preference \u2013 like a painting of your pet.\n\nA boost in confidence\n\nJade Lee, CEO and Co-Founder of TAH has made it the company\u2019s mission to boost the confidence of local artisans and micro-entrepreneurs.\n\nOne such entrepreneur is Aesos Lai, who used to run a souvenir gift shop and durian-centric caf\u00e9 at tourist hot spot Central Market.

Thus, he urged the government to manage the sales and distribution of self-test kits efficiently via subsidisation or price control mechanisms, and immediately curb and end sales of fake kits as well as sales by unqualified sellers.\n\n\n\nIn view of potential price control mechanisms, MPS suggested that the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) give a one-month grace period before implementation as the move would assist pharmacists who have already purchased the self-test kits at a higher cost to clear the more expensive stock.\n\n\u201cIn the event a grace period is not granted, MPS wants a subsidy or refund mechanism be put in place to avoid losses to pharmacists who purchased the stocks in good faith.\n\n\u201cIn ensuring price controls benefit the public, KPDNHEP must ensure price controls include not only standardisation of the sales price but also control of the cost price from the supplier,\u201d Amrahi noted.\n\nHe said this is because MPS has received numerous complaints from the public and pharmacists that self-test kits are being sold online and via WhatsApp at extremely low prices and with no guarantee of the product being genuine.\n\nAs KPDNHEP only has a general complaints page, MPS also suggested that a dedicated page be set up to enable complaints against fake products and sales by non-pharmacists and non-doctors.\n\nAmrahi said this would enable turnover of complaints to be handled quickly and efficiently by the KPDNHEP enforcement arm.\n\nHe added that it is critical that a mechanism to identify fake and genuine stock of self-test kits be implemented to further protect the public.\n\n\u201cSuppliers of self-test kits, KPDNHEP and the Malaysian Device Authority (MDA) should work on this immediately,\u201d he stressed.\n\nAdditionally, he said KPDNHEP should also help enforce MDA\u2019s policy for conditional approval that allows only licensed pharmacies and healthcare facilities to sell selftest kits

These expanded measures will take effect today (16 August 2021).\n\n\u201cThe government understands that many personal activities have been disrupted as a result of this pandemic. This includes buying household items and doing basic upkeep like haircuts. The government is aware, the longer this is restricted, the greater the risk to the mental and physical health of the people,\u201d PM Muhyiddin said.\n\nThe government also sees that, he added, it is very important for economic sectors to reopen in stages because if the situation persists, the impact especially on business owners and their employees will be worse.\n\nThe latest series of updates are explained in detail below, and cover the following:\n\nThe 11 more sectors allowed to operate in Phase One of National Recovery Plan\n\nThe additional 11 sectors allowed to operate in Phase Two of National Recovery Plan\n\nManufacturing, construction, mining, and quarrying activities to resume, based on percentage of fully-vaccinated workforce\n\nVisiting parks for exercising and for recreational activities to be allowed (for individual activities only)\n\nPlans for travel bubble to pilot with Langkawi Island\n\nScroll below for the updates.\n\nUpdates to Phase One of National Recovery Plan\n\nIn that regard, for states under Phase One of NRP, there are 11 business sectors that are allowed to operate, effective 16 August 2021. They are:\n\nCar wash; Electrical and electronics stores; Household goods and kitchen utensils; Furniture stores; Sports equipment stores; Car accessories stores; Car distribution and sales centre; Morning and farmers\u2019 markets; Clothing, fashion, and accessories stores; Jewellery stores, and Hairdressers and beauty salons (for basic barber services only).\n\nThis decision came after the government assessed the pandemic situation with the risk assessment data conducted by the Ministry of Health Malaysia (MOH), Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) and \u201cafter discussing with all stakeholders in the sectors of interest\u201d.\n\nThe Prime Minister also noted that for clothing, fashion, and accessory stores; jewellery stores; as well as barbershops and beauty salons, there are additional health SOPs that must be adhered to.\n\n\u201cThis includes wearing gloves, limiting business time between employees and customers and not allowing the use of fitting rooms. These SOPs may be complicated but they are for the safety of employees and customers.\n\n\u201cOwners of premises listed in the business that can re-operate must also ensure that customers who enter the premises must show a COVID-19 digital vaccination certificate to prove that the individual has received a complete vaccination,\u201d PM Muhyiddin said.\n\nUpdates to Phase Two of National Recovery Plan\n\nFor states in Phase Two of NRP, an additional 11 business sectors will be allowed to operate (over and above those listed in Phase One), effective 16 August 2021. They are:\n\nPhotographic goods store and photographic services; Second-hand items; Florists and nurseries; Handicraft and souvenir stores; Antique stores; Toy stores; Carpet stores; Creative content and creative industry equipment stores; Outdoor equipment stores (including camping, fishing and other equipment); Cosmetics, skin care, and perfume stores, and Tobacco stores (including vape and electronic cigarettes).\n\n\u201cOwners of premises listed have to ensure that customers who enter the premises must show a COVID-19 digital vaccination certificate to prove that the individual has received a complete vaccination,\u201d the Prime Minister reiterated.\n\nManufacturing, construction, mining, and quarrying activities to resume\n\n\u201cI would also like to inform that the government has agreed to allow all non-essential activities in the manufacturing, construction, mining and quarrying sectors to resume operations from 16 August 2021 in states that are under Phase One, Two, and Three of NRP.\n\n\u201cHowever, the operating capacity depends on the rate of complete vaccination of the workers,\u201d PM Muhyiddin said.\n\nThis translates into the following:\n\nShould the manufacturing, construction, mining and quarrying business have 80% to 100% of employees fully-vaccinated, then they are allowed to operate with 100% capacity.\n\nSimilarly, for 60% to 79% of employees fully-vaccinated, then operating capacity is at 80%;\n\nFinally, for 40% to 59% of fully-vaccinated workforce, then operating capacity is at 60%.\n\nFurther, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) reminded that companies are required to declare the number and names of their fully-vaccinated employees in the COVID-19 Intelligent Management System (CIMS) 3.0 system.\n\nUpon declaration, the company may directly download the latest approval letter from the system to operate.\n\nThe government understands, PM Muhyiddin noted, this decision will provoke various reactions from the public who are concerned about the risk of contagion. He reassured that this decision is \u201cmade with care\u201d, and that it is necessary because \u201cmany employers began to reduce the workforce, causing many to lose their jobs\u201d - and the government cannot allow this situation to continue.\n\nPM Muhyiddin added: \u201cI would like to remind all employers to comply with and meet the conditions that have been set before resuming operations to ensure the safety of employees and secure work. At the same time, take full advantage of the wage subsidy initiatives provided by the Government to ensure that every employee receives their salary payment.\u201d\n\nVisiting parks for exercising and for recreational activities\n\nBeyond the economic aspect of Malaysia, the Prime Minister also announced more measures to boost the nation\u2019s mental wellbeing. This is by allowing locals in states under Phase One of NRP to visit parks for exercising and for recreational activities.\n\n\u201cBut remember, only activities that can be done individually such as jogging, cycling and exercising are allowed, in line with the sports and leisure SOPs in Phase One of NRP,\u201d PM Muhyiddin said.\n\nHe added that the public is also only allowed to visit public recreational parks in the neighbourhood; not to cross states, or regions to go to other recreational parks. Local authorities and agencies will monitor the situation, and ensure that health SOPs are adhered to.\n\nPlans for travel bubble to pilot with Langkawi Island\n\nIn his speech, PM Muhyiddin also spoke of the government\u2019s plans to implement a travel bubble at Langkawi Island. This will be a pilot project for the fully-vaccinated, and will be crucial to \u201crevive the tourism industry.\u201d\n\nHe shared that the Ministry of Health (MOH) and health experts have advised the government to implement this plan only when the complete vaccination rate of the population of Langkawi Island reaches at least 80% of the total population.\n\nAs of 15 August 2021, however, according to the COVID-19 Vaccine Supply Assurance Special Committee (Jawatankuasa Khas Jaminan Akses Bekalan Vaksin COVID-19/JKJAV), the nation\u2019s vaccination rate is at 45.9% (with two doses) and at 72.9% (with one dose).\n\nApart from Langkawi Island, PM Muhyiddin said, the government also has plans to implement a tourism bubble approach in more destinations, other than Langkawi Island, throughout the country.\n\n\u201cHowever, this matter is still at the planning stage and the government will look at the results of the pilot project (Langkawi Island) first. If all goes well, the tourism bubble will be implemented more widely,\u201d the Prime Minister added.\n\nAlso read: SOPs for fully-vaccinated individuals in Malaysia: Phases 1, 2 and 3 of NRP [Aug

self-test kits and wrong use of these kits would produce inaccurate results such as false negatives that would not help in combating the pandemic.\n\n\"Furthermore, with more cases of BID, the government needs to act immediately before the situation worsens,\" he said in a statement on Thursday (Aug 19).\n\nHe added that ideally, self-test kits should be provided free to the public, but if the government is not able to do so, a mechanism to subsidise the cost should be put into place.\n\nThus, MPS is urging the government to manage the sales and distribution of self-test kits efficiently via subsidisation or price control mechanisms, and immediately curb and end sales of fake kits, as well as sales by unqualified sellers.\n\nIn view of potential price control mechanisms, MPS advised the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry to give a grace period of one month before implementation as the move would assist pharmacists who have already purchased the self-test kits at a higher cost to clear the more expensive stock.\n\n\"In the event a grace period is not granted, MPS wants a subsidy or refund mechanism to be put in place to avoid losses to pharmacists who purchased the stocks in good faith.\n\n\"In ensuring price controls benefit the public, the ministry must ensure price controls include not only standardisation of the sales price, but also control of the cost price from the supplier,\" he said.\n\nThis is because MPS has received numerous complaints from the public and from pharmacists of self-test kits being sold online and via WhatsApp at extremely low prices, and with no guarantee of the product being genuine.\n\nAs the ministry only has a general complaints page at https://eaduan.kpdnhep.gov.my/, MPS also suggested that a dedicated page be set up to enable complaints against fake products and sales by non-pharmacists and non-doctors.\n\n\"This would enable turnover of complaints to be handled quickly and efficiently by the ministry's enforcement arm,\" said Amrahi.\n\nHe added that it is critical that a mechanism to identify fake and genuine stock of self-test kits be implemented to further protect the public and suppliers of self-test kits, the ministry and the Malaysian Device Authority (MDA) should work on it immediately.\n\n\"In addition to all the above, the ministry should also help enforce the MDA's policy for conditional approval that allows only licensed pharmacies and healthcare facilities to sell self-test kits online with a proactive approach in barring runners and unqualified sellers from selling self-test kits, as they don\u2019t conform to MDA\u2019s prerequisites of stock-keeping and information sharing with customers,\" he said.", "keyword": ["pharmacists", "kits", "regulation",

David Marshel said DBKL was not looking at the big picture of the issue.\n\n\u201cDBKL should go after the stores that sell illegal and cheap liquor,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen you stop legitimate outlets from selling hard liquor, you will only create illegal ones that may very likely thrive.\n\n\u201cIllegal liquor is bottled to look like the genuine ones. They are sold in the black market.\u201d\n\nMarshel said instead of going after Chinese medicine halls and convenience stores, DBKL should ban the sale of hard liquor at sundry shops, which he said was easily accessible to youths, especially schoolchildren.\n\nAccepting the ruling\n\nMeanwhile the Kuala Lumpur chapter of Federation of Sundry Goods Merchants Association of Malaysia (FSGMAM) has decided not to appeal against DBKL\u2019s new liquor regulations.\n\n\n\nHong says FSGMAM will not appeal against DBKL\u2019s new hard liquor regulations once it comes into force.Its president Hong Chee Meng said the association found the multiple licences that they had to apply from various government agencies like DBKL as well as Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP), too cumbersome.\n\n\u201cRed tape aside, it is also expensive to renew the licence fees annually,\u201d Hong said.\n\n\u201cMany feel that the numerous checks by enforcement authorities such as DBKL, KPDNHEP, the police and Customs were taking its toll.\n\n\u201cThe general feedback from our members in Kuala Lumpur is that they will no longer sell hard liquor on their premises,\u201d he said, adding that in some states, the annual liquor licence fee was as high as RM5,000.\n\nFSGMAM has some 4,000 members nationwide with about 10,000 sundry shops. In Kuala Lumpur, there is slightly over 1,000 members. However, less than 20% sell hard liquor.\n\nDBKL started clamping down on the sale of liquor last June when Annuar called on it to stop issuing liquor licences.\n\nThe move was reportedly aimed at curbing cases of drink-driving but it had not gone down well with stakeholders who were not consulted about it.\n\nBased on DBKL\u2019s records, 2,400 liquor licences have been issued so far and the Excise Licensing Board of the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur (ELBKL) was looking at processing some 1,100 applications pending since 2019.\n\nA source from City Hall said the excise board would meet with members and Kuala Lumpur mayor Datuk Seri Mahadi Che Ngah soon, and a decision would be made on whether to implement or cancel the regulations.\n\n\u201cFrom what I hear, it\u2019s 50/50 right now, so anything can happen,\u201d added the source.\n\nELBKL chairman Datuk Jason Lau Beng Wei confirmed that a meeting was being planned to discuss the matter.\n\n\u201cFor now I have no comments but please bear with us on this,\u201d he said.", "keyword": ["liquor", "prior", "impose", "blanket", "dbkl", "ban", "hard", "sell", "association", "discussions", "sale", "chinese", "stakeholders", "decision", "shops", "appeal", "members"], "summary": "Effective Oct 1, they will no longer be allowed to sell hard liquor.\nThose who want to buy hard liquor can still do so at liquor shops, pubs, bars, restaurants as well as supermarkets and hypermarkets in shopping complexes.\nSeveral members expressed their disappointment last year when DBKL decided to impose the blanket ban on the sale of hard liquor without holding discussions with stakeholders.\n\u201cWhen you stop legitimate outlets from selling hard liquor, you will only create illegal ones that may very likely thrive.\nHowever, less than 20% sell hard liquor.", "news": "The Star Online", "date": "2021-08-16 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Toyota celebrates 50m Corollas sold worldwide", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWFsYXlzaWFucmVzZXJ2ZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wOC8xNy90b3lvdGEtY2VsZWJyYXRlcy01MG0tY29yb2xsYXMtc29sZC13b3JsZHdpZGUv0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVtYWxheXNpYW5yZXNlcnZlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA4LzE3L3RveW90YS1jZWxlYnJhdGVzLTUwbS1jb3JvbGxhcy1zb2xkLXdvcmxkd2lkZS9hbXAv?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://themalaysianreserve.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Toyota.jpg", "text": "by BERNAMA / pic by AFP\n\nKUALA LUMPUR \u2013 Japanese carmaker Toyota has sold 50 million units of its Corolla model worldwide with 300,000 sold in the Malaysian market to date.\n\nPresident of UMW Toyota Motor Ravindran K said the success of the model was due to it being a new standard of automotive excellence in this class of cars, offering customers a dynamic and advanced sedan with luxurious styling.\n\n\u201cEach generation, right from the very first, has been a contributor in the brand transformation.

This was despite Low not having any official 1MDB positions.\n\nMohd Hazem went on to assert his belief that Najib as the prime minister was part of Low\u2019s \u201cscheme\u201d for 1MDB, also claiming that Najib had allegedly known that 1MDB\u2019s funds had gone missing but that the then prime minister was purportedly putting on a \u201cdrama\u201d by allegedly pretending to enquire about the funds\u2019 status.\n\nMohd Hazem said all this while testifying as the 10th prosecution witness against Najib in the latter\u2019s trial involving more than RM2 billion of 1MDB funds.\n\nUnder cross-examination by Najib\u2019s lawyer Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah, Mohd Hazem agreed that former 1MDB senior management officials Terence Geh and Jasmine Loo were directly under Low\u2019s control and that he knew from the beginning when he became CEO that the duo\u2019s loyalty was only to Low and not to 1MDB. The two officials were supposed to be under Hazem\u2019s supervision as the CEO.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the two 1MDB officials acted solely at Low\u2019s direction and that they were not necessarily acting for the interests of 1MDB, Mohd Hazem said he did not do anything to avoid this situation as he equated Low and Najib together.\n\nShafee: Now I want to confront you with this important question, why didn\u2019t you do anything about it? Why didn\u2019t you at least bring this up to the board of directors?\n\nHazem: I think we go back to what I told before, they are the people of Jho Low, and Jho Low basically is the prime minister.\n\nWhen Shafee asked if he had attempt to clarify if Low was the actual alter ego of the then prime minister Najib, Hazem said he had spoke with 1MDB then chairman Tan Sri Lodin Wok Kamaruddin, 1MDB then director Tan Sri Ismee Ismail and Najib\u2019s then principal private secretary Datuk Azlin Alias. Hazem later said he had done his best to speak to the relevant personnel who have \u201cdirect access\u201d to the prime minister.\n\nHazem claimed that Lodin and the whole 1MDB board already knew that the company was being run by Low.\n\nAsked for what he specifically told Lodin about both Geh and Loo, Hazem said most of their conversations revolved around their \u201cconcerns of Jho Low handling 1MDB\u201d.\n\nHazem said that he had basically told Lodin about 1MDB being in Low\u2019s \u201chands\u201d and expressed concern over Low running or controlling the company, adding that Lodin had also shared the same concerns.\n\nAsked by Shafee, Hazem confirmed that he had never asked or suggested to Lodin for them to confirm with then PM Najib on what is Low\u2019s role and whether Low controlled 1MDB to the exclusion of Hazem as the CEO.\n\nShafee: But you agree the way you described Jho Low controlling the senior management, you were virtually not the CEO?\n\nHazem: Yes.\n\nShafee: Jho Low was running the company through the management?\n\nHazem: Yes, in a way.\n\nHazem confirmed that he did not suggest to Lodin for them to resolve this by checking with then prime minister Najib if this was how the company 1MDB is to operate, and that he did not take any other measures and did not know if Lodin had asked Najib about such issues.\n\nShafee then suggested that Hazem was making presumptions without evidence that \u201cJho Low is the prime minister and the prime minister is Jho Low\u201d and that Low\u2019s directions essentially came from Najib, but Hazem pointed to meetings where both Najib and Low were present regarding 1MDB matters.\n\nHazem specifically cited a November 28, 2013 meeting at Najib\u2019s house at Jalan Langgak Duta attended by 1MDB officials and BSI Singapore representative Yak Yew Chee, where Low was present and had started the meeting by briefing about 1MDB matters such as 1MDB\u2019s US$2.3 billion funds that were purportedly invested overseas under the custody of BSI Bank and what BSI Bank had told 1MDB auditor KPMG about the funds.\n\nWhen asked how the November 2013 meeting showed that directives from Low to 1MDB management are what Najib has directed, Hazem replied: \u201cThis is with regards to 1MDB, why would Jho Low need to be there?\u201d\n\nHazem later also pointed out that Low was an \u201cexternal party\u201d and had attending the meeting at the prime minister\u2019s house on 1MDB matters, saying that this was evidence that Low was representing Najib\u2019s interests: \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that he (Low) shouldn\u2019t be there at all. He was there and accepted in the meeting.\u201d\n\nHazem confirmed that he had never asked Najib on what Low\u2019s role was and how he was supposed to react as CEO.\n\nHazem had previously described Low as Najib\u2019s trusted right-hand man, proxy and special adviser for 1MDB.\n\nAbout the bonus\n\nShafee: You said truly you were not a CEO.\n\nHazem: Yes.\n\nShafee: You were virtually led by the nose with the greatest respect?\n\nHazem: Yes.\n\nHazem agreed with Shafee that he was concerned and ashamed at having being reduced to being impotent as a CEO and that this affected his pride, adding that he had very little control or no control over the matter.\n\nShafee then repeatedly grilled Hazem about the decision in a 1MDB board meeting on April 22, 2014 \u2014 which Hazem had excused himself from \u2014 to give him a bonus after the 1MDB remuneration committee assessed his performance as having \u201cexceeded expectations\u201d.\n\nShafee repeatedly questioned whether Hazem had felt ashamed for receiving a bonus on top of his monthly salary of more than RM90,000 when the company was allegedly going down the drain and when his pride was affected as he was led by the nose as a CEO.\n\nDeputy public prosecutor Akram Ahmad Gharib then said such questions were not relevant to the charges that Najib was facing and that Hazem had already answered that it was a decision made by the 1MDB board.\n\nShafee explained that he was trying to challenge Hazem\u2019s credibility: \u201cI\u2019m trying to show the inconsistent answers he has provided, namely on one hand he said he felt ashamed, his pride is affected because as a CEO he was completely not CEO, Jho Low was CEO, so he was not doing any work, he was just taking orders virtually, so if your pride is affected, naturally the question is why do you receive so much bonus and how do you feel?\u201d\n\nHazem later said he was not ashamed to have received his salary and bonus worth a combined RM2.9 million for the entire year of 2014 as he had done his job as required to meet targets set by the 1MDB board.\n\nHazem disagreed with Shafee\u2019s suggestion that he was purportedly shameless in receiving the salary and bonus as he was part of a purported conspiracy with Low to hoodwink 1MDB.\n\nWas it a \u2018drama\u2019?\n\nShafee highlighted the November 28, 2013 meeting at Najib\u2019s house and another meeting where Hazem was subsequently recorded as informing KPMG on another day that BSI Bank\u2019s Yak had assured the prime minister that 1MDB\u2019s US$2.3 billion investment was intact.\n\nHazem said he did not know for a fact at that point that the funds had disappeared, but had suspected that the funds \u201cprobably have disappeared\u201d.\n\nShafee then questioned why Hazem had not asked to speak privately to then prime minister Najib and share his suspicions about 1MDB funds to help save the company and the country, with Hazem then saying he believed Najib already knew the funds were gone.\n\nHazem: Because as far as I\u2019m concerned, the prime minister knows it, he is part of the scheme.\n\nShafee: The prime minister knows the money disappeared?\n\nHazem: From the very beginning I told you, the presence of Jho Low is the prime minister, that was what I was told.\n\nHazem however agreed he had never confirmed if Low was \u201ctruly the PM\u201d and agreed that he was making a presumption that Najib already knew the 1MDB funds were missing.\n\nShafee: Do you think Datuk Seri Najib, at that meeting, do you think Datuk Seri Najib when he asked for the assurance of the funds, he was being briefed about the funds, all those meetings, are you saying Datuk Seri Najib was pretending to ask all these questions because he knows the money disappeared?\n\nHazem: I won\u2019t answer on his behalf.\n\nShafee: I\u2019m asking you, are you saying Datuk Seri Najib when he was being briefed about the funds, it was all a drama by Datuk Seri Najib?\n\nHazem: Yes.\n\nHazem later disagreed with Shafee\u2019s suggestion that it was not Najib trying to put on a drama about the 1MDB funds, and disagreed that it was Hazem, Yak and Low trying to put on the alleged drama to impress Najib and 1MDB board members.\n\nNajib\u2019s 1MDB trial before High Court judge Collin Lawrence Sequerah resumes tomorrow morning. \u2014 Malay Mail", "keyword": ["low",

to resign after 15 Umno Members of Parliament withdrew support for him and the opposition rejected his offer of cross-party cooperation.\n\n\u201cI heard the sincere appeal of millions of Malaysians

Almost three in five (59%) saw their productivity levels suffer as they were perpetually stressed about getting infected at their workplace and compromising the health of their loved ones.\n\nDespite their health and safety concerns, less than one in two respondents (47%) said their employers have incentivised them to get vaccinated against Covid-19.\n\nFahad Naeem, head of operations at Randstad Malaysia, said: \u201cIt is not a surprise that people put a premium on their health and safety during a pandemic.\n\n\u201cIn doing so, workers also expect their employers to take added precautionary measures to safeguard their health and safety. At the minimum, companies should implement stringent health and safety procedures and allow those who are able to work from home to do so.\u201d\n\nFahad said employers should also strengthen their workforce\u2019s herd immunity by actively encouraging workers to take the vaccine.\n\nIn spite of the potential health and safety implications and sharp spikes in the number of Covid-19 cases in Malaysia, 64% of respondents said their employers would like them to work on-site.

Not least because, in essence, there was nothing innovative about it.\n\nIn the 1970s, Apple, Atari and Commodore were already producing computer models. But the strength of the IBM PC lay mainly in its ability to outsource the production of its components to other companies.\n\nAs soon as it was released, the company decided to publish the design and software code of the model, allowing other players in the sector to design compatible products.\n\nIn the IBM PC, the processor was an Intel 8088, the floppy drive was from Tandon, and the operating system was Microsoft\u2019s QDOS. IBM, on the other hand, supplied only the monitor, keyboard, and system unit.\n\nLittle by little, the personal computer became more commonplace in homes, whereas its predecessors had failed to earn mass acceptance.\n\nAnd in 1983, Time magazine awarded it the prize for machine of the year, even though the award is generally used to celebrate people.\n\nBacklash to the rapid success\n\nBut the price of fame turned out to be higher than expected.

covered his political journey up to when he became the Prime Minister on 29 February 2020.\n\nREAD MORE: The Dark Horse of Malaysian Politics: Muhyiddin Yassin\n\nHowever, let\u2019s take a look at how he got to where he is today and the political scheme of things that have led to him tendering his resignation as the eighth Prime Minister of Malaysia.\n\nWhere The Troubles Began\n\nMahiaddin being sworn in.\n\nAt 72, Mahiaddin was sworn in as Prime Minister by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong on 1 March 2020 after a week of uncertainty following the collapse of Pakatan Harapan government that was led by Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad.\n\nThe Yang di-Pertuan Agong Al-Sultan Abdullah Ri\u2019ayatuddin Al-Mustafa Billah Shah intervened to solve the deadlock by consulting with all Members of Parliament one-by-one in private, before appointing Mahiaddin as the Prime Minister.\n\nAs he was put into the position without a general election or public vote, there was still a chance that Mahiaddin could be replaced when Parliament convened on 9 March 2020. But until then, he had a chance to form a government.\n\nDodging The Bullet\n\nAzhar Azizan Harun.\n\nAlmost immediately there were reports of the 14th Parliamentary Assembly sitting being postponed to May 18. It then became a single day sitting to hear the speech by the Yang di-Pertuan. There. There will be no meeting.\n\nDue to the Covid-19 dangers at the time, a Parliamentary meeting was set for 13 July instead. It was during this meeting that Mahiaddin flexed his support by narrowly clearing a major political test to remove the lower house speaker.\n\nDatuk Azhar Azizan Harun was installed as Dewan Rakyat Speaker after a lunch break without a vote from MPs. The move brought ire from the opposition.\n\nAll motions for a confidence vote were unlikely to happen.\n\nThe Third Wave\n\nElement5 Digital / Unsplash\n\nCovid-19 cases in Malaysia were low. The country was considered one of the best countries in the world to have handled the pandemic. It sustained the people\u2019s confidence in Mahiaddin. But then, a misstep\u2026\n\nThe Sabah state election (26 September to 12 October 2020) resulted in a third wave of Covid-19 cases as people from across the country went there to campaign and then returned home.\n\nAfterwards, the government scrambled to contain the outbreak by imposing a conditional movement order in Sabah and selected states.\n\nThe Hail Mary\n\nAs the number of cases increased, Mahiaddin\u2019s popularity waned. Nothing he did, from the ever-changing MCO and National Recovery Plan to Financial Assistance and SOPs, seemed to work.\n\nAll the while Mahiaddin was operating as the Prime Minister without a deputy. Some speculated that it was done to prevent votes for him from splintering.\n\nThat changed this year (2021) on 7 July when he named Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob as his deputy and Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein as a Senior Minister. A move, some say, was done to placate UMNO and for Mahiaddin to retain a majority.\n\nThe Fumble\n\nParliament, 26 July 2021\n\nOn 26 July 2021, Parliament and Law Minister Datuk Seri Takiyuddin Hassan, stated that Emergency Ordinances, which had been in place since 11 January, were retracted on 21 July.\n\nThe statement was then rebuked by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong who holds the Constitutional right to enact and repeal the Emergency Ordinance.\n\nThe issue fractured Mahiaddin\u2019s already fragile alliance. Because of it, two Ministers and about a dozen MPs pulled their support for the Prime Minister and the opposition challenged his majority.\n\nOn 13 August, Mahiaddin extended an olive branch to the opposition. He promised a General Election, a cross-party framework, and additional funds. But, it did not work. Some even looked at it as a bribe.\n\nToday (16 August), after less than two years, Mahiaddin has resigned his position as Prime Minister.\n\nLet us know on TRP\u2019s Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram!", "keyword": ["months", "malaysias", "17", "8th", "resigned", "installed", "agong", "cases", "mahiaddin", "minister", "prime", "dipertuan", "parliament", "election", "political", "vote"], "summary": "Tan Sri Mahiaddin Md Yasin, also known as Muhyiddin Yassin, had the unenviable task of being the Prime Minister of Malaysia during an unprecedented global pandemic.\nWe have covered his political journey up to when he became the Prime Minister on 29 February 2020.\nThe statement was then rebuked by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong who holds the Constitutional right to enact and repeal the Emergency Ordinance.\nBecause of it, two Ministers and about a dozen MPs pulled their support for the Prime Minister and the opposition challenged his majority.\nToday (16 August), after less than two years, Mahiaddin has resigned his position as Prime Minister.", "news": "The Rakyat Post", "date": "2021-08-16 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Buy And Sell Artisanal Goods On This Uniquely Malaysian e-Commerce Platform", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL2xpdmluZy8yMDIxLzA4LzE4L2J1eS1hbmQtc2VsbC1hcnRpc2FuYWwtZ29vZHMtb24tdGhpcy11bmlxdWVseS1tYWxheXNpYW4tZS1jb21tZXJjZS1wbGF0Zm9ybS_SAYABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlcmFreWF0cG9zdC5jb20vbGl2aW5nLzIwMjEvMDgvMTgvYnV5LWFuZC1zZWxsLWFydGlzYW5hbC1nb29kcy1vbi10aGlzLXVuaXF1ZWx5LW1hbGF5c2lhbi1lLWNvbW1lcmNlLXBsYXRmb3JtL2FtcC8?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Maya Suraya", "Azizul Rahman Ismail"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/TAHFI1.jpg", "text": "Subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates.\n\nThe Artisans Haven (TAH) is an online platform that showcases talented Malaysian artisans and their handmade products.\n\nFirst formed in September 2020, TAH was created as an answer to individuals who suddenly lost their jobs due to Covid-19 and had turned to the handmade artisan sector as a financial lifeline.\n\nAccording to Rosalie Lin, Brand & PR Advisory and co-Founder of TAH, what makes their platform different from other e-Commerce sites is how dedicated the team are to tell the story behind particular products and the sellers behind them.\n\nAnother distinctive feature is also how nothing is ever the same on the platform as most things are handmade, and can be customised to your preference \u2013 like a painting of your pet.\n\nA boost in confidence\n\nJade Lee, CEO and Co-Founder of TAH has made it the company\u2019s mission to boost the confidence of local artisans and micro-entrepreneurs.\n\nOne such entrepreneur is Aesos Lai, who used to run a souvenir gift shop and durian-centric caf\u00e9 at tourist hot spot Central Market.

Thus, he urged the government to manage the sales and distribution of self-test kits efficiently via subsidisation or price control mechanisms, and immediately curb and end sales of fake kits as well as sales by unqualified sellers.\n\n\n\nIn view of potential price control mechanisms, MPS suggested that the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) give a one-month grace period before implementation as the move would assist pharmacists who have already purchased the self-test kits at a higher cost to clear the more expensive stock.\n\n\u201cIn the event a grace period is not granted, MPS wants a subsidy or refund mechanism be put in place to avoid losses to pharmacists who purchased the stocks in good faith.\n\n\u201cIn ensuring price controls benefit the public, KPDNHEP must ensure price controls include not only standardisation of the sales price but also control of the cost price from the supplier,\u201d Amrahi noted.\n\nHe said this is because MPS has received numerous complaints from the public and pharmacists that self-test kits are being sold online and via WhatsApp at extremely low prices and with no guarantee of the product being genuine.\n\nAs KPDNHEP only has a general complaints page, MPS also suggested that a dedicated page be set up to enable complaints against fake products and sales by non-pharmacists and non-doctors.\n\nAmrahi said this would enable turnover of complaints to be handled quickly and efficiently by the KPDNHEP enforcement arm.\n\nHe added that it is critical that a mechanism to identify fake and genuine stock of self-test kits be implemented to further protect the public.\n\n\u201cSuppliers of self-test kits, KPDNHEP and the Malaysian Device Authority (MDA) should work on this immediately,\u201d he stressed.\n\nAdditionally, he said KPDNHEP should also help enforce MDA\u2019s policy for conditional approval that allows only licensed pharmacies and healthcare facilities to sell selftest kits

The government is aware, the longer this is restricted, the greater the risk to the mental and physical health of the people,\u201d PM Muhyiddin said.\n\nThe government also sees that, he added, it is very important for economic sectors to reopen in stages because if the situation persists, the impact especially on business owners and their employees will be worse.\n\nThe latest series of updates are explained in detail below, and cover the following:\n\nThe 11 more sectors allowed to operate in Phase One of National Recovery Plan\n\nThe additional 11 sectors allowed to operate in Phase Two of National Recovery Plan\n\nManufacturing, construction, mining, and quarrying activities to resume, based on percentage of fully-vaccinated workforce\n\nVisiting parks for exercising and for recreational activities to be allowed (for individual activities only)\n\nPlans for travel bubble to pilot with Langkawi Island\n\nScroll below for the updates.\n\nUpdates to Phase One of National Recovery Plan\n\nIn that regard, for states under Phase One of NRP, there are 11 business sectors that are allowed to operate, effective 16 August 2021. They are:\n\nCar wash; Electrical and electronics stores; Household goods and kitchen utensils; Furniture stores; Sports equipment stores; Car accessories stores; Car distribution and sales centre; Morning and farmers\u2019 markets; Clothing, fashion, and accessories stores; Jewellery stores, and Hairdressers and beauty salons (for basic barber services only).\n\nThis decision came after the government assessed the pandemic situation with the risk assessment data conducted by the Ministry of Health Malaysia (MOH), Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) and \u201cafter discussing with all stakeholders in the sectors of interest\u201d.\n\nThe Prime Minister also noted that for clothing, fashion, and accessory stores; jewellery stores; as well as barbershops and beauty salons, there are additional health SOPs that must be adhered to.\n\n\u201cThis includes wearing gloves, limiting business time between employees and customers and not allowing the use of fitting rooms. These SOPs may be complicated but they are for the safety of employees and customers.\n\n\u201cOwners of premises listed in the business that can re-operate must also ensure that customers who enter the premises must show a COVID-19 digital vaccination certificate to prove that the individual has received a complete vaccination,\u201d PM Muhyiddin said.\n\nUpdates to Phase Two of National Recovery Plan\n\nFor states in Phase Two of NRP, an additional 11 business sectors will be allowed to operate (over and above those listed in Phase One), effective 16 August 2021. They are:\n\nPhotographic goods store and photographic services; Second-hand items; Florists and nurseries; Handicraft and souvenir stores; Antique stores; Toy stores; Carpet stores; Creative content and creative industry equipment stores; Outdoor equipment stores (including camping, fishing and other equipment); Cosmetics, skin care, and perfume stores, and Tobacco stores (including vape and electronic cigarettes).\n\n\u201cOwners of premises listed have to ensure that customers who enter the premises must show a COVID-19 digital vaccination certificate to prove that the individual has received a complete vaccination,\u201d the Prime Minister reiterated.\n\nManufacturing, construction, mining, and quarrying activities to resume\n\n\u201cI would also like to inform that the government has agreed to allow all non-essential activities in the manufacturing, construction, mining and quarrying sectors to resume operations from 16 August 2021 in states that are under Phase One, Two, and Three of NRP.\n\n\u201cHowever, the operating capacity depends on the rate of complete vaccination of the workers,\u201d PM Muhyiddin said.\n\nThis translates into the following:\n\nShould the manufacturing, construction, mining and quarrying business have 80% to 100% of employees fully-vaccinated, then they are allowed to operate with 100% capacity.\n\nSimilarly, for 60% to 79% of employees fully-vaccinated, then operating capacity is at 80%;\n\nFinally, for 40% to 59% of fully-vaccinated workforce, then operating capacity is at 60%.\n\nFurther, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) reminded that companies are required to declare the number and names of their fully-vaccinated employees in the COVID-19 Intelligent Management System (CIMS) 3.0 system.\n\nUpon declaration, the company may directly download the latest approval letter from the system to operate.\n\nThe government understands, PM Muhyiddin noted, this decision will provoke various reactions from the public who are concerned about the risk of contagion. He reassured that this decision is \u201cmade with care\u201d, and that it is necessary because \u201cmany employers began to reduce the workforce, causing many to lose their jobs\u201d - and the government cannot allow this situation to continue.\n\nPM Muhyiddin added: \u201cI would like to remind all employers to comply with and meet the conditions that have been set before resuming operations to ensure the safety of employees and secure work. At the same time, take full advantage of the wage subsidy initiatives provided by the Government to ensure that every employee receives their salary payment.\u201d\n\nVisiting parks for exercising and for recreational activities\n\nBeyond the economic aspect of Malaysia, the Prime Minister also announced more measures to boost the nation\u2019s mental wellbeing. This is by allowing locals in states under Phase One of NRP to visit parks for exercising and for recreational activities.\n\n\u201cBut remember, only activities that can be done individually such as jogging, cycling and exercising are allowed, in line with the sports and leisure SOPs in Phase One of NRP,\u201d PM Muhyiddin said.\n\nHe added that the public is also only allowed to visit public recreational parks in the neighbourhood; not to cross states, or regions to go to other recreational parks. Local authorities and agencies will monitor the situation, and ensure that health SOPs are adhered to.\n\nPlans for travel bubble to pilot with Langkawi Island\n\nIn his speech, PM Muhyiddin also spoke of the government\u2019s plans to implement a travel bubble at Langkawi Island. This will be a pilot project for the fully-vaccinated, and will be crucial to \u201crevive the tourism industry.\u201d\n\nHe shared that the Ministry of Health (MOH) and health experts have advised the government to implement this plan only when the complete vaccination rate of the population of Langkawi Island reaches at least 80% of the total population.\n\nAs of 15 August 2021, however, according to the COVID-19 Vaccine Supply Assurance Special Committee (Jawatankuasa Khas Jaminan Akses Bekalan Vaksin COVID-19/JKJAV), the nation\u2019s vaccination rate is at 45.9% (with two doses) and at 72.9% (with one dose).\n\nApart from Langkawi Island, PM Muhyiddin said, the government also has plans to implement a tourism bubble approach in more destinations, other than Langkawi Island, throughout the country.\n\n\u201cHowever, this matter is still at the planning stage and the government will look at the results of the pilot project (Langkawi Island) first. If all goes well, the tourism bubble will be implemented more widely,\u201d the Prime Minister added.\n\nAlso read: SOPs for fully-vaccinated individuals in Malaysia: Phases 1, 2 and 3 of NRP [Aug

self-test kits and wrong use of these kits would produce inaccurate results such as false negatives that would not help in combating the pandemic.\n\n\"Furthermore, with more cases of BID, the government needs to act immediately before the situation worsens,\" he said in a statement on Thursday (Aug 19).\n\nHe added that ideally, self-test kits should be provided free to the public, but if the government is not able to do so, a mechanism to subsidise the cost should be put into place.\n\nThus, MPS is urging the government to manage the sales and distribution of self-test kits efficiently via subsidisation or price control mechanisms, and immediately curb and end sales of fake kits, as well as sales by unqualified sellers.\n\nIn view of potential price control mechanisms, MPS advised the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry to give a grace period of one month before implementation as the move would assist pharmacists who have already purchased the self-test kits at a higher cost to clear the more expensive stock.\n\n\"In the event a grace period is not granted, MPS wants a subsidy or refund mechanism to be put in place to avoid losses to pharmacists who purchased the stocks in good faith.\n\n\"In ensuring price controls benefit the public, the ministry must ensure price controls include not only standardisation of the sales price, but also control of the cost price from the supplier,\" he said.\n\nThis is because MPS has received numerous complaints from the public and from pharmacists of self-test kits being sold online and via WhatsApp at extremely low prices, and with no guarantee of the product being genuine.\n\nAs the ministry only has a general complaints page at https://eaduan.kpdnhep.gov.my/, MPS also suggested that a dedicated page be set up to enable complaints against fake products and sales by non-pharmacists and non-doctors.\n\n\"This would enable turnover of complaints to be handled quickly and efficiently by the ministry's enforcement arm,\" said Amrahi.\n\nHe added that it is critical that a mechanism to identify fake and genuine stock of self-test kits be implemented to further protect the public and suppliers of self-test kits, the ministry and the Malaysian Device Authority (MDA) should work on it immediately.\n\n\"In addition to all the above, the ministry should also help enforce the MDA's policy for conditional approval that allows only licensed pharmacies and healthcare facilities to sell self-test kits online with a proactive approach in barring runners and unqualified sellers from selling self-test kits, as they don\u2019t conform to MDA\u2019s prerequisites of stock-keeping and information sharing with customers,\" he said.", "keyword": ["pharmacists", "kits", "regulation",

David Marshel said DBKL was not looking at the big picture of the issue.\n\n\u201cDBKL should go after the stores that sell illegal and cheap liquor,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen you stop legitimate outlets from selling hard liquor, you will only create illegal ones that may very likely thrive.\n\n\u201cIllegal liquor is bottled to look like the genuine ones. They are sold in the black market.\u201d\n\nMarshel said instead of going after Chinese medicine halls and convenience stores, DBKL should ban the sale of hard liquor at sundry shops, which he said was easily accessible to youths, especially schoolchildren.\n\nAccepting the ruling\n\nMeanwhile the Kuala Lumpur chapter of Federation of Sundry Goods Merchants Association of Malaysia (FSGMAM) has decided not to appeal against DBKL\u2019s new liquor regulations.\n\n\n\nHong says FSGMAM will not appeal against DBKL\u2019s new hard liquor regulations once it comes into force.Its president Hong Chee Meng said the association found the multiple licences that they had to apply from various government agencies like DBKL as well as Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP), too cumbersome.\n\n\u201cRed tape aside, it is also expensive to renew the licence fees annually,\u201d Hong said.\n\n\u201cMany feel that the numerous checks by enforcement authorities such as DBKL, KPDNHEP, the police and Customs were taking its toll.\n\n\u201cThe general feedback from our members in Kuala Lumpur is that they will no longer sell hard liquor on their premises,\u201d he said, adding that in some states, the annual liquor licence fee was as high as RM5,000.\n\nFSGMAM has some 4,000 members nationwide with about 10,000 sundry shops.

This was despite Low not having any official 1MDB positions.\n\nMohd Hazem went on to assert his belief that Najib as the prime minister was part of Low\u2019s \u201cscheme\u201d for 1MDB, also claiming that Najib had allegedly known that 1MDB\u2019s funds had gone missing but that the then prime minister was purportedly putting on a \u201cdrama\u201d by allegedly pretending to enquire about the funds\u2019 status.\n\nMohd Hazem said all this while testifying as the 10th prosecution witness against Najib in the latter\u2019s trial involving more than RM2 billion of 1MDB funds.\n\nUnder cross-examination by Najib\u2019s lawyer Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah, Mohd Hazem agreed that former 1MDB senior management officials Terence Geh and Jasmine Loo were directly under Low\u2019s control and that he knew from the beginning when he became CEO that the duo\u2019s loyalty was only to Low and not to 1MDB. The two officials were supposed to be under Hazem\u2019s supervision as the CEO.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the two 1MDB officials acted solely at Low\u2019s direction and that they were not necessarily acting for the interests of 1MDB, Mohd Hazem said he did not do anything to avoid this situation as he equated Low and Najib together.\n\nShafee: Now I want to confront you with this important question, why didn\u2019t you do anything about it? Why didn\u2019t you at least bring this up to the board of directors?\n\nHazem: I think we go back to what I told before, they are the people of Jho Low, and Jho Low basically is the prime minister.\n\nWhen Shafee asked if he had attempt to clarify if Low was the actual alter ego of the then prime minister Najib, Hazem said he had spoke with 1MDB then chairman Tan Sri Lodin Wok Kamaruddin, 1MDB then director Tan Sri Ismee Ismail and Najib\u2019s then principal private secretary Datuk Azlin Alias. Hazem later said he had done his best to speak to the relevant personnel who have \u201cdirect access\u201d to the prime minister.\n\nHazem claimed that Lodin and the whole 1MDB board already knew that the company was being run by Low.\n\nAsked for what he specifically told Lodin about both Geh and Loo, Hazem said most of their conversations revolved around their \u201cconcerns of Jho Low handling 1MDB\u201d.\n\nHazem said that he had basically told Lodin about 1MDB being in Low\u2019s \u201chands\u201d and expressed concern over Low running or controlling the company, adding that Lodin had also shared the same concerns.\n\nAsked by Shafee, Hazem confirmed that he had never asked or suggested to Lodin for them to confirm with then PM Najib on what is Low\u2019s role and whether Low controlled 1MDB to the exclusion of Hazem as the CEO.\n\nShafee: But you agree the way you described Jho Low controlling the senior management, you were virtually not the CEO?\n\nHazem: Yes.\n\nShafee: Jho Low was running the company through the management?\n\nHazem: Yes, in a way.\n\nHazem confirmed that he did not suggest to Lodin for them to resolve this by checking with then prime minister Najib if this was how the company 1MDB is to operate, and that he did not take any other measures and did not know if Lodin had asked Najib about such issues.\n\nShafee then suggested that Hazem was making presumptions without evidence that \u201cJho Low is the prime minister and the prime minister is Jho Low\u201d and that Low\u2019s directions essentially came from Najib, but Hazem pointed to meetings where both Najib and Low were present regarding 1MDB matters.\n\nHazem specifically cited a November 28, 2013 meeting at Najib\u2019s house at Jalan Langgak Duta attended by 1MDB officials and BSI Singapore representative Yak Yew Chee, where Low was present and had started the meeting by briefing about 1MDB matters such as 1MDB\u2019s US$2.3 billion funds that were purportedly invested overseas under the custody of BSI Bank and what BSI Bank had told 1MDB auditor KPMG about the funds.\n\nWhen asked how the November 2013 meeting showed that directives from Low to 1MDB management are what Najib has directed, Hazem replied: \u201cThis is with regards to 1MDB, why would Jho Low need to be there?\u201d\n\nHazem later also pointed out that Low was an \u201cexternal party\u201d and had attending the meeting at the prime minister\u2019s house on 1MDB matters, saying that this was evidence that Low was representing Najib\u2019s interests: \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that he (Low) shouldn\u2019t be there at all. He was there and accepted in the meeting.\u201d\n\nHazem confirmed that he had never asked Najib on what Low\u2019s role was and how he was supposed to react as CEO.\n\nHazem had previously described Low as Najib\u2019s trusted right-hand man, proxy and special adviser for 1MDB.\n\nAbout the bonus\n\nShafee: You said truly you were not a CEO.\n\nHazem: Yes.\n\nShafee: You were virtually led by the nose with the greatest respect?\n\nHazem: Yes.\n\nHazem agreed with Shafee that he was concerned and ashamed at having being reduced to being impotent as a CEO and that this affected his pride, adding that he had very little control or no control over the matter.\n\nShafee then repeatedly grilled Hazem about the decision in a 1MDB board meeting on April 22, 2014 \u2014 which Hazem had excused himself from \u2014 to give him a bonus after the 1MDB remuneration committee assessed his performance as having \u201cexceeded expectations\u201d.\n\nShafee repeatedly questioned whether Hazem had felt ashamed for receiving a bonus on top of his monthly salary of more than RM90,000 when the company was allegedly going down the drain and when his pride was affected as he was led by the nose as a CEO.\n\nDeputy public prosecutor Akram Ahmad Gharib then said such questions were not relevant to the charges that Najib was facing and that Hazem had already answered that it was a decision made by the 1MDB board.\n\nShafee explained that he was trying to challenge Hazem\u2019s credibility: \u201cI\u2019m trying to show the inconsistent answers he has provided, namely on one hand he said he felt ashamed, his pride is affected because as a CEO he was completely not CEO, Jho Low was CEO, so he was not doing any work, he was just taking orders virtually, so if your pride is affected, naturally the question is why do you receive so much bonus and how do you feel?\u201d\n\nHazem later said he was not ashamed to have received his salary and bonus worth a combined RM2.9 million for the entire year of 2014 as he had done his job as required to meet targets set by the 1MDB board.\n\nHazem disagreed with Shafee\u2019s suggestion that he was purportedly shameless in receiving the salary and bonus as he was part of a purported conspiracy with Low to hoodwink 1MDB.\n\nWas it a \u2018drama\u2019?\n\nShafee highlighted the November 28, 2013 meeting at Najib\u2019s house and another meeting where Hazem was subsequently recorded as informing KPMG on another day that BSI Bank\u2019s Yak had assured the prime minister that 1MDB\u2019s US$2.3 billion investment was intact.\n\nHazem said he did not know for a fact at that point that the funds had disappeared, but had suspected that the funds \u201cprobably have disappeared\u201d.\n\nShafee then questioned why Hazem had not asked to speak privately to then prime minister Najib and share his suspicions about 1MDB funds to help save the company and the country, with Hazem then saying he believed Najib already knew the funds were gone.\n\nHazem: Because as far as I\u2019m concerned, the prime minister knows it, he is part of the scheme.\n\nShafee: The prime minister knows the money disappeared?\n\nHazem: From the very beginning I told you, the presence of Jho Low is the prime minister, that was what I was told.\n\nHazem however agreed he had never confirmed if Low was \u201ctruly the PM\u201d and agreed that he was making a presumption that Najib already knew the 1MDB funds were missing.\n\nShafee: Do you think Datuk Seri Najib, at that meeting, do you think Datuk Seri Najib when he asked for the assurance of the funds, he was being briefed about the funds, all those meetings, are you saying Datuk Seri Najib was pretending to ask all these questions because he knows the money disappeared?\n\nHazem: I won\u2019t answer on his behalf.\n\nShafee: I\u2019m asking you, are you saying Datuk Seri Najib when he was being briefed about the funds, it was all a drama by Datuk Seri Najib?\n\nHazem: Yes.\n\nHazem later disagreed with Shafee\u2019s suggestion that it was not Najib trying to put on a drama about the 1MDB funds, and disagreed that it was Hazem, Yak and Low trying to put on the alleged drama to impress Najib and 1MDB board members.\n\nNajib\u2019s 1MDB trial before High Court judge Collin Lawrence Sequerah resumes tomorrow morning. \u2014 Malay Mail", "keyword": ["low",

Almost three in five (59%) saw their productivity levels suffer as they were perpetually stressed about getting infected at their workplace and compromising the health of their loved ones.\n\nDespite their health and safety concerns, less than one in two respondents (47%) said their employers have incentivised them to get vaccinated against Covid-19.\n\nFahad Naeem, head of operations at Randstad Malaysia, said: \u201cIt is not a surprise that people put a premium on their health and safety during a pandemic.\n\n\u201cIn doing so, workers also expect their employers to take added precautionary measures to safeguard their health and safety.

IBM, on the other hand, supplied only the monitor, keyboard, and system unit.\n\nLittle by little, the personal computer became more commonplace in homes, whereas its predecessors had failed to earn mass acceptance.\n\nAnd in 1983, Time magazine awarded it the prize for machine of the year, even though the award is generally used to celebrate people.\n\nBacklash to the rapid success\n\nBut the price of fame turned out to be higher than expected. Indeed, in order to be competitive and put out a large quantity, IBM assembled the 5150 prototype in a hurry, without much verification afterwards.\n\nMeanwhile, Bill Gates\u2019s Microsoft, a newcomer to the operating system market, had set about establishing a dominant position.\n\nOther companies, such as Compaq, Dell or HP, were also starting to manufacture personal computers, more or less legally with respect to IBM.\n\nWithin a short time, competitors took over the PC market.

stories and updates.\n\nTan Sri Mahiaddin Md Yasin, also known as Muhyiddin Yassin, had the unenviable task of being the Prime Minister of Malaysia during an unprecedented global pandemic.\n\nWe have covered his political journey up to when he became the Prime Minister on 29 February 2020.\n\nREAD MORE: The Dark Horse of Malaysian Politics: Muhyiddin Yassin\n\nHowever, let\u2019s take a look at how he got to where he is today and the political scheme of things that have led to him tendering his resignation as the eighth Prime Minister of Malaysia.\n\nWhere The Troubles Began\n\nMahiaddin being sworn in.\n\nAt 72, Mahiaddin was sworn in as Prime Minister by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong on 1 March 2020 after a week of uncertainty following the collapse of Pakatan Harapan government that was led by Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad.\n\nThe Yang di-Pertuan Agong Al-Sultan Abdullah Ri\u2019ayatuddin Al-Mustafa Billah Shah intervened to solve the deadlock by consulting with all Members of Parliament one-by-one in private, before appointing Mahiaddin as the Prime Minister.\n\nAs he was put into the position without a general election or public vote, there was still a chance that Mahiaddin could be replaced when Parliament convened on 9 March 2020. But until then, he had a chance to form a government.\n\nDodging The Bullet\n\nAzhar Azizan Harun.\n\nAlmost immediately there were reports of the 14th Parliamentary Assembly sitting being postponed to May 18. It then became a single day sitting to hear the speech by the Yang di-Pertuan. There. There will be no meeting.\n\nDue to the Covid-19 dangers at the time, a Parliamentary meeting was set for 13 July instead. It was during this meeting that Mahiaddin flexed his support by narrowly clearing a major political test to remove the lower house speaker.\n\nDatuk Azhar Azizan Harun was installed as Dewan Rakyat Speaker after a lunch break without a vote from MPs. The move brought ire from the opposition.\n\nAll motions for a confidence vote were unlikely to happen.\n\nThe Third Wave\n\nElement5 Digital / Unsplash\n\nCovid-19 cases in Malaysia were low. The country was considered one of the best countries in the world to have handled the pandemic. It sustained the people\u2019s confidence in Mahiaddin. But then, a misstep\u2026\n\nThe Sabah state election (26 September to 12 October 2020) resulted in a third wave of Covid-19 cases as people from across the country went there to campaign and then returned home.\n\nAfterwards, the government scrambled to contain the outbreak by imposing a conditional movement order in Sabah and selected states.\n\nThe Hail Mary\n\nAs the number of cases increased, Mahiaddin\u2019s popularity waned. Nothing he did, from the ever-changing MCO and National Recovery Plan to Financial Assistance and SOPs, seemed to work.\n\nAll the while Mahiaddin was operating as the Prime Minister without a deputy. Some speculated that it was done to prevent votes for him from splintering.\n\nThat changed this year (2021) on 7 July when he named Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob as his deputy and Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein as a Senior Minister. A move, some say, was done to placate UMNO and for Mahiaddin to retain a majority.\n\nThe Fumble\n\nParliament, 26 July 2021\n\nOn 26 July 2021, Parliament and Law Minister Datuk Seri Takiyuddin Hassan, stated that Emergency Ordinances, which had been in place since 11 January, were retracted on 21 July.\n\nThe statement was then rebuked by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong who holds the Constitutional right to enact and repeal the Emergency Ordinance.\n\nThe issue fractured Mahiaddin\u2019s already fragile alliance. Because of it, two Ministers and about a dozen MPs pulled their support for the Prime Minister and the opposition challenged his majority.\n\nOn 13 August, Mahiaddin extended an olive branch to the opposition. He promised a General Election, a cross-party framework, and additional funds. But, it did not work. Some even looked at it as a bribe.\n\nToday (16 August), after less than two years, Mahiaddin has resigned his position as Prime Minister.\n\nLet us know on TRP\u2019s Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram!", "keyword": ["months", "malaysias", "17", "8th", "resigned", "installed", "agong", "cases", "mahiaddin", "minister", "prime", "dipertuan", "parliament", "election", "political", "vote"], "summary": "Tan Sri Mahiaddin Md Yasin, also known as Muhyiddin Yassin, had the unenviable task of being the Prime Minister of Malaysia during an unprecedented global pandemic.\nWe have covered his political journey up to when he became the Prime Minister on 29 February 2020.\nThe statement was then rebuked by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong who holds the Constitutional right to enact and repeal the Emergency Ordinance.\nBecause of it, two Ministers and about a dozen MPs pulled their support for the Prime Minister and the opposition challenged his majority.\nToday (16 August), after less than two years, Mahiaddin has resigned his position as Prime Minister.", "news": "The Rakyat Post", "date": "2021-08-16 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Buy And Sell Artisanal Goods On This Uniquely Malaysian e-Commerce Platform", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL2xpdmluZy8yMDIxLzA4LzE4L2J1eS1hbmQtc2VsbC1hcnRpc2FuYWwtZ29vZHMtb24tdGhpcy11bmlxdWVseS1tYWxheXNpYW4tZS1jb21tZXJjZS1wbGF0Zm9ybS_SAYABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlcmFreWF0cG9zdC5jb20vbGl2aW5nLzIwMjEvMDgvMTgvYnV5LWFuZC1zZWxsLWFydGlzYW5hbC1nb29kcy1vbi10aGlzLXVuaXF1ZWx5LW1hbGF5c2lhbi1lLWNvbW1lcmNlLXBsYXRmb3JtL2FtcC8?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Maya Suraya", "Azizul Rahman Ismail"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/TAHFI1.jpg", "text": "Subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates.\n\nThe Artisans Haven (TAH) is an online platform that showcases talented Malaysian artisans and their handmade products.\n\nFirst formed in September 2020, TAH was created as an answer to individuals who suddenly lost their jobs due to Covid-19 and had turned to the handmade artisan sector as a financial lifeline.\n\nAccording to Rosalie Lin, Brand & PR Advisory and co-Founder of TAH, what makes their platform different from other e-Commerce sites is how dedicated the team are to tell the story behind particular products and the sellers behind them.\n\nAnother distinctive feature is also how nothing is ever the same on the platform as most things are handmade, and can be customised to your preference \u2013 like a painting of your pet.\n\nA boost in confidence\n\nJade Lee, CEO and Co-Founder of TAH has made it the company\u2019s mission to boost the confidence of local artisans and micro-entrepreneurs.\n\nOne such entrepreneur is Aesos Lai, who used to run a souvenir gift shop and durian-centric caf\u00e9 at tourist hot spot Central Market.

Thus, he urged the government to manage the sales and distribution of self-test kits efficiently via subsidisation or price control mechanisms, and immediately curb and end sales of fake kits as well as sales by unqualified sellers.\n\n\n\nIn view of potential price control mechanisms, MPS suggested that the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) give a one-month grace period before implementation as the move would assist pharmacists who have already purchased the self-test kits at a higher cost to clear the more expensive stock.\n\n\u201cIn the event a grace period is not granted, MPS wants a subsidy or refund mechanism be put in place to avoid losses to pharmacists who purchased the stocks in good faith.\n\n\u201cIn ensuring price controls benefit the public, KPDNHEP must ensure price controls include not only standardisation of the sales price but also control of the cost price from the supplier,\u201d Amrahi noted.\n\nHe said this is because MPS has received numerous complaints from the public and pharmacists that self-test kits are being sold online and via WhatsApp at extremely low prices and with no guarantee of the product being genuine.\n\nAs KPDNHEP only has a general complaints page, MPS also suggested that a dedicated page be set up to enable complaints against fake products and sales by non-pharmacists and non-doctors.\n\nAmrahi said this would enable turnover of complaints to be handled quickly and efficiently by the KPDNHEP enforcement arm.\n\nHe added that it is critical that a mechanism to identify fake and genuine stock of self-test kits be implemented to further protect the public.\n\n\u201cSuppliers of self-test kits, KPDNHEP and the Malaysian Device Authority (MDA) should work on this immediately,\u201d he stressed.\n\nAdditionally, he said KPDNHEP should also help enforce MDA\u2019s policy for conditional approval that allows only licensed pharmacies and healthcare facilities to sell selftest kits

These expanded measures will take effect today (16 August 2021).\n\n\u201cThe government understands that many personal activities have been disrupted as a result of this pandemic. This includes buying household items and doing basic upkeep like haircuts. The government is aware, the longer this is restricted, the greater the risk to the mental and physical health of the people,\u201d PM Muhyiddin said.\n\nThe government also sees that, he added, it is very important for economic sectors to reopen in stages because if the situation persists, the impact especially on business owners and their employees will be worse.\n\nThe latest series of updates are explained in detail below, and cover the following:\n\nThe 11 more sectors allowed to operate in Phase One of National Recovery Plan\n\nThe additional 11 sectors allowed to operate in Phase Two of National Recovery Plan\n\nManufacturing, construction, mining, and quarrying activities to resume, based on percentage of fully-vaccinated workforce\n\nVisiting parks for exercising and for recreational activities to be allowed (for individual activities only)\n\nPlans for travel bubble to pilot with Langkawi Island\n\nScroll below for the updates.\n\nUpdates to Phase One of National Recovery Plan\n\nIn that regard, for states under Phase One of NRP, there are 11 business sectors that are allowed to operate, effective 16 August 2021. They are:\n\nCar wash; Electrical and electronics stores; Household goods and kitchen utensils; Furniture stores; Sports equipment stores; Car accessories stores; Car distribution and sales centre; Morning and farmers\u2019 markets; Clothing, fashion, and accessories stores; Jewellery stores, and Hairdressers and beauty salons (for basic barber services only).\n\nThis decision came after the government assessed the pandemic situation with the risk assessment data conducted by the Ministry of Health Malaysia (MOH), Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) and \u201cafter discussing with all stakeholders in the sectors of interest\u201d.\n\nThe Prime Minister also noted that for clothing, fashion, and accessory stores; jewellery stores; as well as barbershops and beauty salons, there are additional health SOPs that must be adhered to.\n\n\u201cThis includes wearing gloves, limiting business time between employees and customers and not allowing the use of fitting rooms. These SOPs may be complicated but they are for the safety of employees and customers.\n\n\u201cOwners of premises listed in the business that can re-operate must also ensure that customers who enter the premises must show a COVID-19 digital vaccination certificate to prove that the individual has received a complete vaccination,\u201d PM Muhyiddin said.\n\nUpdates to Phase Two of National Recovery Plan\n\nFor states in Phase Two of NRP, an additional 11 business sectors will be allowed to operate (over and above those listed in Phase One), effective 16 August 2021. They are:\n\nPhotographic goods store and photographic services; Second-hand items; Florists and nurseries; Handicraft and souvenir stores; Antique stores; Toy stores; Carpet stores; Creative content and creative industry equipment stores; Outdoor equipment stores (including camping, fishing and other equipment); Cosmetics, skin care, and perfume stores, and Tobacco stores (including vape and electronic cigarettes).\n\n\u201cOwners of premises listed have to ensure that customers who enter the premises must show a COVID-19 digital vaccination certificate to prove that the individual has received a complete vaccination,\u201d the Prime Minister reiterated.\n\nManufacturing, construction, mining, and quarrying activities to resume\n\n\u201cI would also like to inform that the government has agreed to allow all non-essential activities in the manufacturing, construction, mining and quarrying sectors to resume operations from 16 August 2021 in states that are under Phase One, Two, and Three of NRP.\n\n\u201cHowever, the operating capacity depends on the rate of complete vaccination of the workers,\u201d PM Muhyiddin said.\n\nThis translates into the following:\n\nShould the manufacturing, construction, mining and quarrying business have 80% to 100% of employees fully-vaccinated, then they are allowed to operate with 100% capacity.\n\nSimilarly, for 60% to 79% of employees fully-vaccinated, then operating capacity is at 80%;\n\nFinally, for 40% to 59% of fully-vaccinated workforce, then operating capacity is at 60%.\n\nFurther, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) reminded that companies are required to declare the number and names of their fully-vaccinated employees in the COVID-19 Intelligent Management System (CIMS) 3.0 system.\n\nUpon declaration, the company may directly download the latest approval letter from the system to operate.\n\nThe government understands, PM Muhyiddin noted, this decision will provoke various reactions from the public who are concerned about the risk of contagion. He reassured that this decision is \u201cmade with care\u201d, and that it is necessary because \u201cmany employers began to reduce the workforce, causing many to lose their jobs\u201d - and the government cannot allow this situation to continue.\n\nPM Muhyiddin added: \u201cI would like to remind all employers to comply with and meet the conditions that have been set before resuming operations to ensure the safety of employees and secure work. At the same time, take full advantage of the wage subsidy initiatives provided by the Government to ensure that every employee receives their salary payment.\u201d\n\nVisiting parks for exercising and for recreational activities\n\nBeyond the economic aspect of Malaysia, the Prime Minister also announced more measures to boost the nation\u2019s mental wellbeing. This is by allowing locals in states under Phase One of NRP to visit parks for exercising and for recreational activities.\n\n\u201cBut remember, only activities that can be done individually such as jogging, cycling and exercising are allowed, in line with the sports and leisure SOPs in Phase One of NRP,\u201d PM Muhyiddin said.\n\nHe added that the public is also only allowed to visit public recreational parks in the neighbourhood; not to cross states, or regions to go to other recreational parks. Local authorities and agencies will monitor the situation, and ensure that health SOPs are adhered to.\n\nPlans for travel bubble to pilot with Langkawi Island\n\nIn his speech, PM Muhyiddin also spoke of the government\u2019s plans to implement a travel bubble at Langkawi Island. This will be a pilot project for the fully-vaccinated, and will be crucial to \u201crevive the tourism industry.\u201d\n\nHe shared that the Ministry of Health (MOH) and health experts have advised the government to implement this plan only when the complete vaccination rate of the population of Langkawi Island reaches at least 80% of the total population.\n\nAs of 15 August 2021, however, according to the COVID-19 Vaccine Supply Assurance Special Committee (Jawatankuasa Khas Jaminan Akses Bekalan Vaksin COVID-19/JKJAV), the nation\u2019s vaccination rate is at 45.9% (with two doses) and at 72.9% (with one dose).\n\nApart from Langkawi Island, PM Muhyiddin said, the government also has plans to implement a tourism bubble approach in more destinations, other than Langkawi Island, throughout the country.\n\n\u201cHowever, this matter is still at the planning stage and the government will look at the results of the pilot project (Langkawi Island) first. If all goes well, the tourism bubble will be implemented more widely,\u201d the Prime Minister added.\n\nAlso read: SOPs for fully-vaccinated individuals in Malaysia: Phases 1, 2 and 3 of NRP [Aug

the unregulated sales of Covid-19 self-test kits, especially via WhatsApp and social media, as well as sales by unqualified sellers who are neither pharmacists nor doctors.\n\n\"Fake Covid-19 self-test kits and wrong use of these kits would produce inaccurate results such as false negatives that would not help in combating the pandemic.\n\n\"Furthermore, with more cases of BID, the government needs to act immediately before the situation worsens,\" he said in a statement on Thursday (Aug 19).\n\nHe added that ideally, self-test kits should be provided free to the public, but if the government is not able to do so, a mechanism to subsidise the cost should be put into place.\n\nThus, MPS is urging the government to manage the sales and distribution of self-test kits efficiently via subsidisation or price control mechanisms, and immediately curb and end sales of fake kits, as well as sales by unqualified sellers.\n\nIn view of potential price control mechanisms, MPS advised the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry to give a grace period of one month before implementation as the move would assist pharmacists who have already purchased the self-test kits at a higher cost to clear the more expensive stock.\n\n\"In the event a grace period is not granted, MPS wants a subsidy or refund mechanism to be put in place to avoid losses to pharmacists who purchased the stocks in good faith.\n\n\"In ensuring price controls benefit the public, the ministry must ensure price controls include not only standardisation of the sales price, but also control of the cost price from the supplier,\" he said.\n\nThis is because MPS has received numerous complaints from the public and from pharmacists of self-test kits being sold online and via WhatsApp at extremely low prices, and with no guarantee of the product being genuine.\n\nAs the ministry only has a general complaints page at https://eaduan.kpdnhep.gov.my/, MPS also suggested that a dedicated page be set up to enable complaints against fake products and sales by non-pharmacists and non-doctors.\n\n\"This would enable turnover of complaints to be handled quickly and efficiently by the ministry's enforcement arm,\" said Amrahi.\n\nHe added that it is critical that a mechanism to identify fake and genuine stock of self-test kits be implemented to further protect the public and suppliers of self-test kits, the ministry and the Malaysian Device Authority (MDA) should work on it immediately.\n\n\"In addition to all the above, the ministry should also help enforce the MDA's policy for conditional approval that allows only licensed pharmacies and healthcare facilities to sell self-test kits online with a proactive approach in barring runners and unqualified sellers from selling self-test kits, as they don\u2019t conform to MDA\u2019s prerequisites of stock-keeping and information sharing with customers,\" he said.", "keyword": ["pharmacists", "kits", "regulation",

David Marshel said DBKL was not looking at the big picture of the issue.\n\n\u201cDBKL should go after the stores that sell illegal and cheap liquor,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen you stop legitimate outlets from selling hard liquor, you will only create illegal ones that may very likely thrive.\n\n\u201cIllegal liquor is bottled to look like the genuine ones. They are sold in the black market.\u201d\n\nMarshel said instead of going after Chinese medicine halls and convenience stores, DBKL should ban the sale of hard liquor at sundry shops, which he said was easily accessible to youths, especially schoolchildren.\n\nAccepting the ruling\n\nMeanwhile the Kuala Lumpur chapter of Federation of Sundry Goods Merchants Association of Malaysia (FSGMAM) has decided not to appeal against DBKL\u2019s new liquor regulations.\n\n\n\nHong says FSGMAM will not appeal against DBKL\u2019s new hard liquor regulations once it comes into force.Its president Hong Chee Meng said the association found the multiple licences that they had to apply from various government agencies like DBKL as well as Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP), too cumbersome.\n\n\u201cRed tape aside, it is also expensive to renew the licence fees annually,\u201d Hong said.\n\n\u201cMany feel that the numerous checks by enforcement authorities such as DBKL, KPDNHEP, the police and Customs were taking its toll.\n\n\u201cThe general feedback from our members in Kuala Lumpur is that they will no longer sell hard liquor on their premises,\u201d he said, adding that in some states, the annual liquor licence fee was as high as RM5,000.\n\nFSGMAM has some 4,000 members nationwide with about 10,000 sundry shops. In Kuala Lumpur, there is slightly over 1,000 members. However, less than 20% sell hard liquor.\n\nDBKL started clamping down on the sale of liquor last June when Annuar called on it to stop issuing liquor licences.\n\nThe move was reportedly aimed at curbing cases of drink-driving but it had not gone down well with stakeholders who were not consulted about it.\n\nBased on DBKL\u2019s records, 2,400 liquor licences have been issued so far and the Excise Licensing Board of the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur (ELBKL) was looking at processing some 1,100 applications pending since 2019.\n\nA source from City Hall said the excise board would meet with members and Kuala Lumpur mayor Datuk Seri Mahadi Che Ngah soon, and a decision would be made on whether to implement or cancel the regulations.\n\n\u201cFrom what I hear, it\u2019s 50/50 right now, so anything can happen,\u201d added the source.\n\nELBKL chairman Datuk Jason Lau Beng Wei confirmed that a meeting was being planned to discuss the matter.\n\n\u201cFor now I have no comments but please bear with us on this,\u201d he said.", "keyword": ["liquor", "prior", "impose", "blanket", "dbkl", "ban", "hard", "sell", "association", "discussions", "sale", "chinese", "stakeholders", "decision", "shops", "appeal", "members"], "summary": "Effective Oct 1, they will no longer be allowed to sell hard liquor.\nThose who want to buy hard liquor can still do so at liquor shops, pubs, bars, restaurants as well as supermarkets and hypermarkets in shopping complexes.\nSeveral members expressed their disappointment last year when DBKL decided to impose the blanket ban on the sale of hard liquor without holding discussions with stakeholders.\n\u201cWhen you stop legitimate outlets from selling hard liquor, you will only create illegal ones that may very likely thrive.\nHowever, less than 20% sell hard liquor.", "news": "The Star Online", "date": "2021-08-16 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Toyota celebrates 50m Corollas sold worldwide", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWFsYXlzaWFucmVzZXJ2ZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wOC8xNy90b3lvdGEtY2VsZWJyYXRlcy01MG0tY29yb2xsYXMtc29sZC13b3JsZHdpZGUv0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVtYWxheXNpYW5yZXNlcnZlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA4LzE3L3RveW90YS1jZWxlYnJhdGVzLTUwbS1jb3JvbGxhcy1zb2xkLXdvcmxkd2lkZS9hbXAv?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://themalaysianreserve.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Toyota.jpg", "text": "by BERNAMA / pic by AFP\n\nKUALA LUMPUR \u2013 Japanese carmaker Toyota has sold 50 million units of its Corolla model worldwide with 300,000 sold in the Malaysian market to date.\n\nPresident of UMW Toyota Motor Ravindran K said the success of the model was due to it being a new standard of automotive excellence in this class of cars, offering customers a dynamic and advanced sedan with luxurious styling.\n\n\u201cEach generation, right from the very first, has been a contributor in the brand transformation.

For all of us to break the chain, the correct way of using the screening tool is very important.\n\n\u201cThe authenticity of the tool from the correct source is also very important. A false negative result will not help the current situation,\u201d she added.\n\nShe also disclosed that currently 11 types of saliva kits have been approved by Malaysia Ministry of Health.\n\n\u201cSo only purchase the kit approved by the Malaysia Ministry of Health.

This was despite Low not having any official 1MDB positions.\n\nMohd Hazem went on to assert his belief that Najib as the prime minister was part of Low\u2019s \u201cscheme\u201d for 1MDB, also claiming that Najib had allegedly known that 1MDB\u2019s funds had gone missing but that the then prime minister was purportedly putting on a \u201cdrama\u201d by allegedly pretending to enquire about the funds\u2019 status.\n\nMohd Hazem said all this while testifying as the 10th prosecution witness against Najib in the latter\u2019s trial involving more than RM2 billion of 1MDB funds.\n\nUnder cross-examination by Najib\u2019s lawyer Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah, Mohd Hazem agreed that former 1MDB senior management officials Terence Geh and Jasmine Loo were directly under Low\u2019s control and that he knew from the beginning when he became CEO that the duo\u2019s loyalty was only to Low and not to 1MDB. The two officials were supposed to be under Hazem\u2019s supervision as the CEO.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the two 1MDB officials acted solely at Low\u2019s direction and that they were not necessarily acting for the interests of 1MDB, Mohd Hazem said he did not do anything to avoid this situation as he equated Low and Najib together.\n\nShafee: Now I want to confront you with this important question, why didn\u2019t you do anything about it? Why didn\u2019t you at least bring this up to the board of directors?\n\nHazem: I think we go back to what I told before, they are the people of Jho Low, and Jho Low basically is the prime minister.\n\nWhen Shafee asked if he had attempt to clarify if Low was the actual alter ego of the then prime minister Najib, Hazem said he had spoke with 1MDB then chairman Tan Sri Lodin Wok Kamaruddin, 1MDB then director Tan Sri Ismee Ismail and Najib\u2019s then principal private secretary Datuk Azlin Alias. Hazem later said he had done his best to speak to the relevant personnel who have \u201cdirect access\u201d to the prime minister.\n\nHazem claimed that Lodin and the whole 1MDB board already knew that the company was being run by Low.\n\nAsked for what he specifically told Lodin about both Geh and Loo, Hazem said most of their conversations revolved around their \u201cconcerns of Jho Low handling 1MDB\u201d.\n\nHazem said that he had basically told Lodin about 1MDB being in Low\u2019s \u201chands\u201d and expressed concern over Low running or controlling the company, adding that Lodin had also shared the same concerns.\n\nAsked by Shafee, Hazem confirmed that he had never asked or suggested to Lodin for them to confirm with then PM Najib on what is Low\u2019s role and whether Low controlled 1MDB to the exclusion of Hazem as the CEO.\n\nShafee: But you agree the way you described Jho Low controlling the senior management, you were virtually not the CEO?\n\nHazem: Yes.\n\nShafee: Jho Low was running the company through the management?\n\nHazem: Yes, in a way.\n\nHazem confirmed that he did not suggest to Lodin for them to resolve this by checking with then prime minister Najib if this was how the company 1MDB is to operate, and that he did not take any other measures and did not know if Lodin had asked Najib about such issues.\n\nShafee then suggested that Hazem was making presumptions without evidence that \u201cJho Low is the prime minister and the prime minister is Jho Low\u201d and that Low\u2019s directions essentially came from Najib, but Hazem pointed to meetings where both Najib and Low were present regarding 1MDB matters.\n\nHazem specifically cited a November 28, 2013 meeting at Najib\u2019s house at Jalan Langgak Duta attended by 1MDB officials and BSI Singapore representative Yak Yew Chee, where Low was present and had started the meeting by briefing about 1MDB matters such as 1MDB\u2019s US$2.3 billion funds that were purportedly invested overseas under the custody of BSI Bank and what BSI Bank had told 1MDB auditor KPMG about the funds.\n\nWhen asked how the November 2013 meeting showed that directives from Low to 1MDB management are what Najib has directed, Hazem replied: \u201cThis is with regards to 1MDB, why would Jho Low need to be there?\u201d\n\nHazem later also pointed out that Low was an \u201cexternal party\u201d and had attending the meeting at the prime minister\u2019s house on 1MDB matters, saying that this was evidence that Low was representing Najib\u2019s interests: \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that he (Low) shouldn\u2019t be there at all. He was there and accepted in the meeting.\u201d\n\nHazem confirmed that he had never asked Najib on what Low\u2019s role was and how he was supposed to react as CEO.\n\nHazem had previously described Low as Najib\u2019s trusted right-hand man, proxy and special adviser for 1MDB.\n\nAbout the bonus\n\nShafee: You said truly you were not a CEO.\n\nHazem: Yes.\n\nShafee: You were virtually led by the nose with the greatest respect?\n\nHazem: Yes.\n\nHazem agreed with Shafee that he was concerned and ashamed at having being reduced to being impotent as a CEO and that this affected his pride, adding that he had very little control or no control over the matter.\n\nShafee then repeatedly grilled Hazem about the decision in a 1MDB board meeting on April 22, 2014 \u2014 which Hazem had excused himself from \u2014 to give him a bonus after the 1MDB remuneration committee assessed his performance as having \u201cexceeded expectations\u201d.\n\nShafee repeatedly questioned whether Hazem had felt ashamed for receiving a bonus on top of his monthly salary of more than RM90,000 when the company was allegedly going down the drain and when his pride was affected as he was led by the nose as a CEO.\n\nDeputy public prosecutor Akram Ahmad Gharib then said such questions were not relevant to the charges that Najib was facing and that Hazem had already answered that it was a decision made by the 1MDB board.\n\nShafee explained that he was trying to challenge Hazem\u2019s credibility: \u201cI\u2019m trying to show the inconsistent answers he has provided, namely on one hand he said he felt ashamed, his pride is affected because as a CEO he was completely not CEO, Jho Low was CEO, so he was not doing any work, he was just taking orders virtually, so if your pride is affected, naturally the question is why do you receive so much bonus and how do you feel?\u201d\n\nHazem later said he was not ashamed to have received his salary and bonus worth a combined RM2.9 million for the entire year of 2014 as he had done his job as required to meet targets set by the 1MDB board.\n\nHazem disagreed with Shafee\u2019s suggestion that he was purportedly shameless in receiving the salary and bonus as he was part of a purported conspiracy with Low to hoodwink 1MDB.\n\nWas it a \u2018drama\u2019?\n\nShafee highlighted the November 28, 2013 meeting at Najib\u2019s house and another meeting where Hazem was subsequently recorded as informing KPMG on another day that BSI Bank\u2019s Yak had assured the prime minister that 1MDB\u2019s US$2.3 billion investment was intact.\n\nHazem said he did not know for a fact at that point that the funds had disappeared, but had suspected that the funds \u201cprobably have disappeared\u201d.\n\nShafee then questioned why Hazem had not asked to speak privately to then prime minister Najib and share his suspicions about 1MDB funds to help save the company and the country, with Hazem then saying he believed Najib already knew the funds were gone.\n\nHazem: Because as far as I\u2019m concerned, the prime minister knows it, he is part of the scheme.\n\nShafee: The prime minister knows the money disappeared?\n\nHazem: From the very beginning I told you, the presence of Jho Low is the prime minister, that was what I was told.\n\nHazem however agreed he had never confirmed if Low was \u201ctruly the PM\u201d and agreed that he was making a presumption that Najib already knew the 1MDB funds were missing.\n\nShafee: Do you think Datuk Seri Najib, at that meeting, do you think Datuk Seri Najib when he asked for the assurance of the funds, he was being briefed about the funds, all those meetings, are you saying Datuk Seri Najib was pretending to ask all these questions because he knows the money disappeared?\n\nHazem: I won\u2019t answer on his behalf.\n\nShafee: I\u2019m asking you, are you saying Datuk Seri Najib when he was being briefed about the funds, it was all a drama by Datuk Seri Najib?\n\nHazem: Yes.\n\nHazem later disagreed with Shafee\u2019s suggestion that it was not Najib trying to put on a drama about the 1MDB funds, and disagreed that it was Hazem, Yak and Low trying to put on the alleged drama to impress Najib and 1MDB board members.\n\nNajib\u2019s 1MDB trial before High Court judge Collin Lawrence Sequerah resumes tomorrow morning. \u2014 Malay Mail", "keyword": ["low",

Not least because, in essence, there was nothing innovative about it.\n\nIn the 1970s, Apple, Atari and Commodore were already producing computer models. But the strength of the IBM PC lay mainly in its ability to outsource the production of its components to other companies.\n\nAs soon as it was released, the company decided to publish the design and software code of the model, allowing other players in the sector to design compatible products.\n\nIn the IBM PC, the processor was an Intel 8088, the floppy drive was from Tandon, and the operating system was Microsoft\u2019s QDOS. IBM, on the other hand, supplied only the monitor, keyboard, and system unit.\n\nLittle by little, the personal computer became more commonplace in homes, whereas its predecessors had failed to earn mass acceptance.\n\nAnd in 1983, Time magazine awarded it the prize for machine of the year, even though the award is generally used to celebrate people.\n\nBacklash to the rapid success\n\nBut the price of fame turned out to be higher than expected. Indeed, in order to be competitive and put out a large quantity, IBM assembled the 5150 prototype in a hurry, without much verification afterwards.\n\nMeanwhile, Bill Gates\u2019s Microsoft, a newcomer to the operating system market, had set about establishing a dominant position.\n\nOther companies, such as Compaq, Dell or HP, were also starting to manufacture personal computers, more or less legally with respect to IBM.\n\nWithin a short time, competitors took over the PC market. In 2005, IBM sold its PC production business to Lenovo for US$1.3 billion.

But until then, he had a chance to form a government.\n\nDodging The Bullet\n\nAzhar Azizan Harun.\n\nAlmost immediately there were reports of the 14th Parliamentary Assembly sitting being postponed to May 18. It then became a single day sitting to hear the speech by the Yang di-Pertuan. There. There will be no meeting.\n\nDue to the Covid-19 dangers at the time, a Parliamentary meeting was set for 13 July instead. It was during this meeting that Mahiaddin flexed his support by narrowly clearing a major political test to remove the lower house speaker.\n\nDatuk Azhar Azizan Harun was installed as Dewan Rakyat Speaker after a lunch break without a vote from MPs. The move brought ire from the opposition.\n\nAll motions for a confidence vote were unlikely to happen.\n\nThe Third Wave\n\nElement5 Digital / Unsplash\n\nCovid-19 cases in Malaysia were low. The country was considered one of the best countries in the world to have handled the pandemic. It sustained the people\u2019s confidence in Mahiaddin. But then, a misstep\u2026\n\nThe Sabah state election (26 September to 12 October 2020) resulted in a third wave of Covid-19 cases as people from across the country went there to campaign and then returned home.\n\nAfterwards, the government scrambled to contain the outbreak by imposing a conditional movement order in Sabah and selected states.\n\nThe Hail Mary\n\nAs the number of cases increased, Mahiaddin\u2019s popularity waned. Nothing he did, from the ever-changing MCO and National Recovery Plan to Financial Assistance and SOPs, seemed to work.\n\nAll the while Mahiaddin was operating as the Prime Minister without a deputy. Some speculated that it was done to prevent votes for him from splintering.\n\nThat changed this year (2021) on 7 July when he named Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob as his deputy and Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein as a Senior Minister. A move, some say, was done to placate UMNO and for Mahiaddin to retain a majority.\n\nThe Fumble\n\nParliament, 26 July 2021\n\nOn 26 July 2021, Parliament and Law Minister Datuk Seri Takiyuddin Hassan, stated that Emergency Ordinances, which had been in place since 11 January, were retracted on 21 July.\n\nThe statement was then rebuked by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong who holds the Constitutional right to enact and repeal the Emergency Ordinance.\n\nThe issue fractured Mahiaddin\u2019s already fragile alliance. Because of it, two Ministers and about a dozen MPs pulled their support for the Prime Minister and the opposition challenged his majority.\n\nOn 13 August, Mahiaddin extended an olive branch to the opposition. He promised a General Election, a cross-party framework, and additional funds. But, it did not work. Some even looked at it as a bribe.\n\nToday (16 August), after less than two years, Mahiaddin has resigned his position as Prime Minister.\n\nLet us know on TRP\u2019s Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram!", "keyword": ["months", "malaysias", "17", "8th", "resigned", "installed", "agong", "cases", "mahiaddin", "minister", "prime", "dipertuan", "parliament", "election", "political", "vote"], "summary": "Tan Sri Mahiaddin Md Yasin, also known as Muhyiddin Yassin, had the unenviable task of being the Prime Minister of Malaysia during an unprecedented global pandemic.\nWe have covered his political journey up to when he became the Prime Minister on 29 February 2020.\nThe statement was then rebuked by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong who holds the Constitutional right to enact and repeal the Emergency Ordinance.\nBecause of it, two Ministers and about a dozen MPs pulled their support for the Prime Minister and the opposition challenged his majority.\nToday (16 August), after less than two years, Mahiaddin has resigned his position as Prime Minister.", "news": "The Rakyat Post", "date": "2021-08-16 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Buy And Sell Artisanal Goods On This Uniquely Malaysian e-Commerce Platform", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJha3lhdHBvc3QuY29tL2xpdmluZy8yMDIxLzA4LzE4L2J1eS1hbmQtc2VsbC1hcnRpc2FuYWwtZ29vZHMtb24tdGhpcy11bmlxdWVseS1tYWxheXNpYW4tZS1jb21tZXJjZS1wbGF0Zm9ybS_SAYABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlcmFreWF0cG9zdC5jb20vbGl2aW5nLzIwMjEvMDgvMTgvYnV5LWFuZC1zZWxsLWFydGlzYW5hbC1nb29kcy1vbi10aGlzLXVuaXF1ZWx5LW1hbGF5c2lhbi1lLWNvbW1lcmNlLXBsYXRmb3JtL2FtcC8?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Maya Suraya", "Azizul Rahman Ismail"], "top-image": "https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/TAHFI1.jpg", "text": "Subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates.\n\nThe Artisans Haven (TAH) is an online platform that showcases talented Malaysian artisans and their handmade products.\n\nFirst formed in September 2020, TAH was created as an answer to individuals who suddenly lost their jobs due to Covid-19 and had turned to the handmade artisan sector as a financial lifeline.\n\nAccording to Rosalie Lin, Brand & PR Advisory and co-Founder of TAH, what makes their platform different from other e-Commerce sites is how dedicated the team are to tell the story behind particular products and the sellers behind them.\n\nAnother distinctive feature is also how nothing is ever the same on the platform as most things are handmade, and can be customised to your preference \u2013 like a painting of your pet.\n\nA boost in confidence\n\nJade Lee, CEO and Co-Founder of TAH has made it the company\u2019s mission to boost the confidence of local artisans and micro-entrepreneurs.\n\nOne such entrepreneur is Aesos Lai, who used to run a souvenir gift shop and durian-centric caf\u00e9 at tourist hot spot Central Market.
