According to prime minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin, Malaysia is currently subsidising almost 30 sen per litre for RON 95 petrol and diesel, which are now at their respective ceiling prices of RM2.05 and RM2.15 per litre for the March 18-24 week.\n\n\u201cThis means that the government is subsidising a total of RM3 billion at the current price, he said, adding that the ceiling prices were put in place to protect consumers from the impact of fuel price hikes, which are likely to continue given the current trend.\n\nThe price cap for RON 95 and diesel has been around for a while. In 2019, the previous PH government set the ceiling price of RON 95 at RM2.20 per litre, later revising it to RM2.08 in February that year. Meanwhile, the price of diesel was capped at RM2.18.\n\nOn February 10, finance minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Aziz announced that the ceiling price for RON 95 had been lowered to RM2.05 per litre, while that for diesel was also reduced by three sen to RM2.15 per litre.\n\nThese is the maximum price consumers will have to pay for both fuels if market prices push the pump prices above that price level, with the government covering the difference through subsidies.

According to prime minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin, Malaysia is currently subsidising almost 30 sen per litre for RON 95 petrol and diesel, which are now at their respective ceiling prices of RM2.05 and RM2.15 per litre for the March 18-24 week.\n\n\u201cThis means that the government is subsidising a total of RM3 billion at the current price, he said, adding that the ceiling prices were put in place to protect consumers from the impact of fuel price hikes, which are likely to continue given the current trend.\n\nThe price cap for RON 95 and diesel has been around for a while. In 2019, the previous PH government set the ceiling price of RON 95 at RM2.20 per litre, later revising it to RM2.08 in February that year. Meanwhile, the price of diesel was capped at RM2.18.\n\nOn February 10, finance minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Aziz announced that the ceiling price for RON 95 had been lowered to RM2.05 per litre, while that for diesel was also reduced by three sen to RM2.15 per litre.\n\nThese is the maximum price consumers will have to pay for both fuels if market prices push the pump prices above that price level, with the government covering the difference through subsidies.

According to prime minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin, Malaysia is currently subsidising almost 30 sen per litre for RON 95 petrol and diesel, which are now at their respective ceiling prices of RM2.05 and RM2.15 per litre for the March 18-24 week.\n\n\u201cThis means that the government is subsidising a total of RM3 billion at the current price, he said, adding that the ceiling prices were put in place to protect consumers from the impact of fuel price hikes, which are likely to continue given the current trend.\n\nThe price cap for RON 95 and diesel has been around for a while. In 2019, the previous PH government set the ceiling price of RON 95 at RM2.20 per litre, later revising it to RM2.08 in February that year. Meanwhile, the price of diesel was capped at RM2.18.\n\nOn February 10, finance minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Aziz announced that the ceiling price for RON 95 had been lowered to RM2.05 per litre, while that for diesel was also reduced by three sen to RM2.15 per litre.\n\nThese is the maximum price consumers will have to pay for both fuels if market prices push the pump prices above that price level, with the government covering the difference through subsidies.

According to prime minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin, Malaysia is currently subsidising almost 30 sen per litre for RON 95 petrol and diesel, which are now at their respective ceiling prices of RM2.05 and RM2.15 per litre for the March 18-24 week.\n\n\u201cThis means that the government is subsidising a total of RM3 billion at the current price, he said, adding that the ceiling prices were put in place to protect consumers from the impact of fuel price hikes, which are likely to continue given the current trend.\n\nThe price cap for RON 95 and diesel has been around for a while. In 2019, the previous PH government set the ceiling price of RON 95 at RM2.20 per litre, later revising it to RM2.08 in February that year. Meanwhile, the price of diesel was capped at RM2.18.\n\nOn February 10, finance minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Aziz announced that the ceiling price for RON 95 had been lowered to RM2.05 per litre, while that for diesel was also reduced by three sen to RM2.15 per litre.\n\nThese is the maximum price consumers will have to pay for both fuels if market prices push the pump prices above that price level, with the government covering the difference through subsidies.
