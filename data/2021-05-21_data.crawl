Earlier today, we were told that Perodua\u2019s Sentral facility in Section 19, Petaling Jaya remained closed, including its after-sales department. According to a source, the company is expected to make an announcement on the matter soon.\n\nLikewise, Edaran Tan Chong Motor (ETCM) announced yesterday via a FB post that all Nissan workshops are temporarily closed, pending application for operation. The company has not yet updated the status of its after-sales activities as of this point.\n\nMeanwhile, Honda dealerships that have obtained approval for after-sales service to continue have begun doing so.

All businesses will have to comply with tight standard operating procedures (SOPs) and all local authority directives.\n\nCar sales have of course stopped during the two-week period, as well as that for vehicle inspections and registrations, as both Puspakom and the road transport department (JPJ) have announced that no business will be done during the lockdown.

According to the statement released by the ministry yesterday, customers can only stay in retail stores or shopping malls for a maximum duration of two hours once the new directive is put in place tomorrow.\n\nSo, who will be responsible for monitoring this time limit? Based on another document that was released earlier today, the responsibility falls on the retail store and shopping mall operators themselves.

A brutal new wave of the Covid-19 epidemic killed a record high 1,290 people last month.\n\nPPK Malaysia\u2019s circular stated that a total of RM30 per person will be charged as administration fee (RM15 per dose) and another RM20 per person for logistic expenditure (RM10 per dose). The RM30 fee for two doses is supposedly paid to ProtectHealth Corporation, a company owned by the Ministry of Health (MOH) that manages private medical practitioners who sign up as vaccinators under PICK.\n\nCodeBlue contacted PPK Malaysia \u2014 which represents major shopping centres in the Klang Valley and other states \u2014 to verify the authenticity of the circular. A representative from PPK Malaysia said: \u201cYes, we sent the circular. We want to vaccinate the staff to make shopping malls a safer place.\u201d\n\nPPK Malaysia\u2019s circular stated that their coronavirus vaccination programme will be conducted together with the Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) under the Science, Technology and Innovation Ministry (MOSTI) and the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP).\n\n\u201cAs mentioned panel doctors and medical personnel, for example nurses registered under ProtectHealth Corporation (PHC) will administer the vaccinations and malls will need to pay RM15 per dose to PHC,\u201d PPK Malaysia president Teo Chiang Kok said in his May 29 circular to the association\u2019s members.\n\n\u201cAs each course requires two rounds of vaccination, the total cost to be paid to PHC will be RM30 per pax which we will strongly encourage malls to undertake for their own employees.\u201d\n\nHowever, ProtectHealth Corporation denied collecting payments from shopping centres purportedly rolling out Covid-19 inoculation drives with vaccinators from ProtectHealth Corp.\n\n\u201cProtectHealth involvement remains the same for all vaccination centres. We pay private medical practitioners RM14 per dose administered,\u201d Khairul Faizi from the corporate communications unit of ProtectHealth Corp told CodeBlue today.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t supply vaccines as our role is managing the private medical practitioners. The vaccine supply is done by the government, similar to other vaccination centres.\u201d\n\nKPDNHEP corporate communications unit head Yunus Tasim firmly denied collecting money from any party for the shopping centres\u2019 Covid-19 vaccination programmes.\n\n\u201cWe are finding ways to vaccinate the economic frontliners in the country who are in constant interaction with consumers,\u201d Yunus told CodeBlue.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t collect money from anyone for the vaccines. The vaccines are from the government and it is free of charge,\u201d he added.\n\nMalls like Suria KLCC, KL Gateway, Bangsar Village, Aeon, and Damansara Uptown Two have already informed tenants on their Covid-19 vaccination programmes, charging RM50 per vaccine recipient.\n\nKPDNHEP previously announced last May 28 that the \u201cEconomic Frontliners Vaccination Programme\u201d for the retail sector will begin this month, covering more than 500,000 retail workers.\n\nNonetheless, CITF has yet to announce the launch date of this inoculation programme, nor explained whether it would involve charging vaccine recipients or their employers. The source of the Covid-19 vaccine supply for retail workers or other \u201ceconomic frontliners\u201d was not mentioned by any involved stakeholders.\n\nMOSTI did not respond to CodeBlue\u2019s requests for clarification at the time of writing.\n\nVaccine Minister Khairy Jamaluddin said earlier today that the government would begin to vaccinate workers in industries and economic sectors that must remain open during the Movement Control Order (MCO).

ProtectHealth Corporation \u2013 a Ministry of Health (MOH) owned company whose board includes the Health director-general and MOH secretary-general \u2013 and the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) \u2013 which appears to oversee the so-called \u201ceconomic frontliners vaccination programme\u201d for the retail sector \u2013 have denied collecting payments for the vaccine rollouts by shopping centres.\n\nSo, what are shopping centres collecting the money for? If ProtectHealth is already covering the cost of vaccine administration by paying vaccinators RM14 per dose administered, is the RM50 fee to cover the cost of venue rental for setting up vaccination centres (PPVs) at malls? Even then, this seems excessive.\n\nPharmaniaga Bhd, on the other hand, is expected to immediately deliver Sinovac\u2019s coronavirus vaccines to state governments and the private sector, despite Vaccine Minister Khairy Jamaluddin\u2019s previous assertion that the federal government\u2019s order of 12 million doses must be fulfilled in its entirety \u2013 estimated end July \u2013 before Pharmaniaga begins work on other orders.\n\nWith Health Minister Dr Adham Baba and Senior Defence Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob\u2019s latest statement yesterday (Pharmaniaga is controlled by the Armed Forces Fund Board) on Pharmaniaga\u2019s vaccine distribution to states and companies running parallel with PICK, it is unclear if Pharmaniaga can fully deliver the federal government\u2019s order by the end-July target.\n\nWhy is CITF diverting Covid-19 vaccines away from PICK when we have inoculated just a fraction of the 9.4 million targeted individuals who face the highest risk of developing severe disease or dying from Covid-19 \u2013 the elderly, people with comorbidities, and the disabled community?\n\nAs of May 31, just about two million people have received at least one dose of the vaccine. Assuming that about a million of these individuals are frontline workers from the first phase of PICK and young adults who signed up for the AstraZeneca-Oxford jab (numbers are likely higher), that means Malaysia has vaccinated only a million high-risk individuals, or 11 per cent of the 9.4 million targeted.\n\nCITF has yet to publish statistics on the number of high-risk people who have received Covid-19 vaccines so far.\n\nIn the month of May alone, 1,290 people lost their lives to Covid-19 in Malaysia, nearly triple the 471 fatalities recorded in the whole of last year. Although an increasing number of younger adults are dying from Covid-19 in the new wave of the Malaysian epidemic, the elderly remain the primary victims.\n\nAbout 74 per cent of 1,290 people who died from Covid-19 last month, or 955 individuals, were aged 60 years and above. Nearly nine in 10 victims had underlying health conditions, 75 per cent of whom were aged 60 or older.\n\nDozens of people have been dying from Covid-19 every day in Malaysia in the past three weeks. When hospitals and intensive care units (ICUs) are full, our vaccination strategy should focus on reducing the number of people with Covid-19 requiring hospital or critical care, not to cut infections.\n\nPeople who receive vaccination can still contract Covid-19 and possibly infect others, but all approved coronavirus vaccines prevent severe disease and death.\n\nChasing illusory single-digit daily infections \u2013 or even triple-digit infections at this point \u2013 is an impossible endeavour that will take at least six months or even a year, depending on how fast we can inoculate two-thirds of our adult population. As of yesterday, only about 8 per cent of Malaysia\u2019s adult population has received at least one dose.\n\nIf CITF is now changing its vaccination strategy to focus on working adults to prevent further economically devastating lockdowns, then CITF should make this clear. In a scenario with limited resources \u2013 vaccine supply, manpower to run PPVs, and outreach efforts \u2013 there must be priority groups in whichever strategy, whether it\u2019s to protect the most vulnerable or to keep the economy going.\n\nThe UK recorded zero new Covid-19 deaths yesterday for the first time since July 2020. This achievement came after the UK took about six months to vaccinate nearly 75 per cent of the adult population, or over 39 million people, with at least one vaccine dose.\n\nThe UK\u2019s coronavirus vaccination programme, which opened up in phases according to age, hit its target of offering a first jab to all those in top priority groups \u2013 those aged 50 or older as well as people in high-risk categories \u2013 before April 15.\n\nEngland and Scotland have now started offering first vaccines to people aged 30 and above, while Northern Ireland and Wales have begun vaccinating over-18s. Due to the emergence of the variant first discovered in India, renamed the \u201cDelta\u201d variant, England is accelerating second vaccine doses to adults aged 50 and above.\n\nThe UK has the benefit of most residents, including non-nationals, being registered with its NHS, making it easy to reach out to senior citizens for Covid-19 vaccination. Malaysia, on the other hand, has serious challenges in providing vaccine access to the elderly, many of whom live in the community with their families or on their own instead of care homes.\n\nThe over 62,000 no-shows at Covid-19 vaccination appointments in Kedah, Pahang, Kelantan, Perak, Negeri Sembilan, Melaka, Perlis, and Terengganu \u2013 attributed to lack of transport to PPVs and not checking the MySejahtera app for appointment dates \u2013 illustrate the immense difficulty in reaching the elderly population.\n\nBut this does not mean the government should abandon senior citizens and switch focus to easier targets.

Covid-19 vaccinations onsite at shopping malls for participating retail tenants is not profiteering, the Malaysia Shopping Malls Association (PPK Malaysia) said today.\n\nInstead, the association representing shopping malls claimed that the actual estimated cost for logistics and the health personnel needed to administer the Covid-19 vaccines could go up to RM100 and even RM150, and that the malls had actually decided to subsidise the cost with plans to only collect RM50.\n\nPPK Malaysia was speaking of the plans to have onsite Covid-19 vaccination at shopping malls for employees of retail outlets in the malls, through a \u201cpublic-private sector partnership\u201d model.\n\nWhile confirming that the Covid-19 vaccines will be provided by the Malaysian government for free under this partnership PPK Malaysia said shopping malls will be paying for the fees for doctors, nurses and medical officers to Health Ministry-owned ProtectHealth Corporation and all other antecedent costs.\n\nEarlier this week, notices had circulated on social media of purported plans by shopping malls to offer Covid-19 vaccination to retail tenants\u2019 staff at RM50 per person for two doses (with some giving a breakdown of RM15 for administration per dose and RM10 for logistics per dose).\n\nPPK Malaysia said the planned collection of RM50 was meant partly to secure commitment by retail staff to ensure that they would show up for the vaccination, as well as to pay for the services of administering the Covid-19 vaccine to be provided by the private healthcare providers coordinated by ProtectHealth Corporation.\n\n\u201cOur Association members estimated that the cost of providing the venue, logistics, manpower, standby ambulance service etc for the on-site vaccination centre will amount to RM100 to RM150 per pax, depending on volume and total number of doses available each day, the total population to be vaccinated and the duration to complete all the doses.\n\n\u201cIn the interests of the national agenda, it was decided that the malls shall largely subsidise these costs and be allowed to charge merely RM10 x 2 doses = RM20 per pax to partially defray their expenses and as a commitment by the registrant so as to mitigate absenteeism, leading to wastage of vaccines which would otherwise could be administered to those yet to be scheduled and in order to reach herd immunity of the community in the shortest possible time.\n\n\u201cWe were also informed that the doctors and nurses providing their service will be allocated by the Protect Health Corporation who will charge to administer per dose at RM15.\n\n\u201cTherefore, at RM15 per dose x 2 doses equalling RM30, plus the above nominal sum of RM20 to partially defray logistic expenses, a total of RM50 for 2 doses will be charged to participants, principally only our shopping frontliners,\u201d the shopping malls association explained in a statement today.\n\nCovid-19 vaccination urgently needed, speed is key\n\nIn the same statement, PPK Malaysia said it appreciates shopping malls for recognising the need to subsidise the Covid-19 vaccination costs for retail frontliners, in order to protect the retail industry through immunisation and as an overall corporate social responsibility (CSR) contribution towards the national agenda of urgently achieving herd immunity.\n\n\u201cIt has been proven in several overseas countries that the speed of vaccinations is the way to bring down the rate of infections, coupled with self-discipline and strict adherence to SOPs instead of prolonging the need for further MCOs,\u201d it said, referring to the movement control orders (MCO) in the country.\n\nNoting that the Covid-19 vaccination for the public is being planned on a different schedule, the association said the primary purpose for the partnership with the government was to vaccinate all employees of shopping malls and malls\u2019 business outlets, adding that it is believed that the malls would be \u201cmuch safer places for the public to shop with confidence and with peace of mind\u201d once such vaccination is carried out.\n\n\u201cDespite our good intentions, we are distraught with the negative comments in the media that malls are profiteering from this exercise which is extremely far from the truth,\u201d it said, adding that this statement was issued in order to correct and put the record straight.\n\nIt noted that the \u201curgent need for access to vaccination\u201d was reflected in the shopping malls\u2019 \u201centhusiastic participation\u201d and the \u201coverwhelming registration\u201d by mall employees and mall tenants for the proposed onsite Covid-19 vaccination at malls.\n\n\u201cWe truly look forward to the success of this win-win collaboration with the authorities towards the national objective of achieving herd immunity urgently and the ultimate recovery of the economy in due course,\u201d the association said.\n\nEarlier in the statement, PPK Malaysia explained the reasoning for the idea of vaccinating mall tenants\u2019 staff onsite at shopping malls, while also providing updates on the progress of this plan.\n\nCiting the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi\u2019s May 28 announcement of plans to vaccinate an estimated 500,000 employees in the retail industry under the country\u2019s economic frontliners (retail sector) Covid-19 immunisation programme, PPK Malaysia said it lauded the government\u2019s targeting of the relevant economic sectors to speed up the Covid-19 vaccination programme.\n\n\u201cShopping malls together with all retail tenants\u2019 staff are effectively frontliners and we feel that it is imperative for the vaccination exercise to be implemented expeditiously. When vaccinated, our frontliners will not only protect themselves but more importantly, duly protect the shoppers and the public.\n\n\u201cWe are also appreciative that our proposal for on-site vaccination centres at shopping malls is adopted as it is more efficient and logical to bring the medical personnel to come on-site to administer the vaccinations instead of all the staff having to take time off work to travel to outside vaccination centres, thus interrupting business and daily operations,\u201d PPK Malaysia said.\n\nIn the May 28 statement by the KPDNHEP minister, he too had spoken of his ministry\u2019s cooperation with the Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) for the vaccination of \u201ceconomic frontliners\u201d in the retail sector expected to start in June, and had also spoke on discussions involving CITF on the same day with 60 representatives from the retail industry.\n\nThe minister had also on May 28 spoken of his ministry\u2019s cooperation with PPK Malaysia, the Malaysia Retailers Association (MRA), and Malaysia Retail Chain Association (MRCA) to establish Covid-19 vaccination centres (PPVs) at strategic locations nationwide, while also urging all retail companies to join this vaccination programme to help achieve the government\u2019s target of vaccinating 80 per cent of the population before the year ends.\n\nToday, PPK Malaysia said such an initiative in collaboration with the authorities has received \u201centhusiastic response\u201d from its members malls and retailers, noting that more than 50 malls have already notified their interest to host PPVs nationwide.\n\n\u201cDetails of this programme and the confirmed locations are being finalised and will be announced, once approved in due course, and we do look forward to the rollout by end of June 2021 onwards as scheduled,\u201d it said, having noted that it had already had several meetings with the authorities on this public-private sector partnership for Covid-19 vaccination.\n\nAbout ProtectHealth Corporation\n\nOn its website, ProtectHealth Corporation Sdn Bhd states that the not-for-profit company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Health Ministry\u2019s ProtectHealth Malaysia. It further states that it was appointed by the ministry to implement the participation of private medical practitioners in the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme.\n\nBased on information on ProtectHealth\u2019s website, private general practitioners do not need to pay to participate in the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme, but would have to receive training and also prepare their own personal protective equipment.\n\nThe website also states that ProtectHealth would pay general practitioners RM14 for their administration of each dose of Covid-19 vaccines through clinic and community outreach models, while payment of RM45 per hour would be paid to them for Covid-19 vaccination under government-organised mass vaccination models.\n\nProtectHealth Corporation denied collecting payments from shopping centres purportedly rolling out Covid-19 inoculation drives with vaccinators from ProtectHealth Corp.\n\n\u201cProtectHealth involvement remains the same for all vaccination centres. We pay private medical practitioners RM14 per dose administered,\u201d Khairul Faizi from the corporate communications unit of ProtectHealth Corp told CodeBlue today.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t supply vaccines as our role is managing the private medical practitioners. The vaccine supply is done by the government, similar to other vaccination centres.\u201d\n\nHealth news portal CodeBlue yesterday reported ProtectHealth Corporation as stating its role as merely managing the private medical practitioners carrying out Covid-19 vaccination work and that it pays RM14 per dose administered to such private healthcare personnel.\n\nCodeBlue yesterday also reported ProtectHealth Corporation as denying collecting payments from shopping malls for Covid-19 vaccination in collaboration with the company. \u2013 MalayMail", "keyword": ["shopping", "fee",

a landmark decision, the Intellectual Property High Court in Kuala Lumpur has declared that the sale, offer for sale, distribution and/or supply of TV Boxes or illicit streaming devices (ISDs) that can provide unauthorised access to copyrighted works, constitutes copyright infringement under the Copyright Act 1987.\n\nThe action in the Intellectual Property High Court was brought by satellite operator Measat Broadcast Networks, the service provider for Malaysian pay-TV platform Astro, against a seller of ISDs preloaded with applications which act as gateways to websites or content servers streaming pirated content.\n\nThe historic judgment, considered to be the first by the Intellectual Property High Court, is positively received by the authorities and industry players in their battle against digital piracy. Industry leaders including Astro laud the High Court\u2019s judgement as a bold step in the right direction against piracy in Malaysia.\n\n\u201cThe declaration by the High Court that sale of ISD which allows access to unauthorised copyright content amounts to copyright infringement sets a precedent for future civil claims on copyright infringement against ISD sellers in the market, including those on e-commerce platforms,\u201d stated Laila Saat, Director, Regulatory of Astro. \u201cThis ground-breaking declaration will strengthen intellectual property protection in the country and ongoing anti-piracy efforts, which are pivotal to ensure continuous investment and job creation in Malaysia\u2019s media and entertainment industry. We will continue to work with authorities and content partners to send a strong message that content piracy is theft, illegal and punishable by law.\u201d\n\n\u201cMCMC welcomes the court\u2019s decision, this will strengthen the legal aspects in protecting copyright infringement and battle against piracy, especially in digital and networked forms,\u201d added Zulkarnain Mohd Yasin, Chief Regulatory Officer of the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC).\n\n\u201cAcknowledging that more proactive action is needed to fight digital piracy in the country, FINAS expresses full support for legal action taken by Astro against ISD sellers and all digital piracy activities as these illegal activities has caused the local creative industry a huge loss in revenue every year,\u201d commented Dr. Ahmad Idham Ahmad Nadzri, CEO of the National Film Development Corporation Malaysia (FINAS). \u201cIn driving more holistic and effective strategy battling digital piracy, FINAS has established the Digital Piracy Eradication Committee with the collective support and involvement of relevant law enforcement agencies to further empower and strengthen enforcement, regulations and the terms of distribution licences in line with the provisions under the FINAS Act 244 1981\u201d.\n\n\u201cMyIPO looks forward for cases concerning ISDs to be brought forward to the Malaysian court,\u201d said Zulkarnain Muhammad, Deputy Director General of the Intellectual Property Corporation of Malaysia (MyIPO). \u201cPrevalent and widespread use of ISDs cause far more economic harm than physical copyright piracy. These devices are part of a wider network of online copyright piracy, which will in the long run disincentive original creators from producing creative work. Copyright piracy in any form should be curbed and deterred.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision is the correct one and we welcome it whole-heartedly,\u201d declared Louis Boswell, CEO of the Asia Video Industry Association (AVIA). \u201cContent is not made for free, and it is the right of creators and distributors to charge for it. To circumvent this and steal it is theft, and I see little difference between the theft of physical goods and the theft of video streams. As a society we need to do more to recognise theft for what it is and this ruling is a strong step in that direction.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is an important and welcome declaration by the Intellectual Property High Court, and sends a clear message that the sale of ISDs that provide unauthorised access to copyrighted works constitutes copyright infringement,\u201d asserted Kevin Plumb, Premier League Director of Legal Services. \u201cThe Premier League is committed to pursuing all those involved with providing illegal access to Premier League content as well as working to raise awareness of the risks fans face when watching via unauthorised sources. We will continue to work with Astro and local authorities as part of our ongoing anti-piracy programme in Malaysia.\u201d\n\nThe estimated loss to the industry and Malaysian economy due to piracy is over RM3 billion (\u20ac590m) annually with RM500 million in taxes and thousands of jobs at risk.\n\nThe declaration by the High Court follows recent criminal cases successfully brought against ISD retailers. On February 8th, a company director of an IT company was charged at the Shah Alam Sessions Court under Section 41 (1) (ha) of the Copyright Act 1987 with promoting Long TV Android boxes which allow the bypassing of technological protection measures on copyright broadcast work. On February 16th, a woman director of a mobile accessory company pleaded guilty to a charge of possessing TV media boxes that contains software to illegally stream Astro\u2019s content via the Internet. She was fined RM30,000 under Section 232(2) of the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998, making her the first ISD seller to be charged under this provision.\n\nThe Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) reiterated that it will take stern action against suppliers and sellers who misuse devices and software to illegally access content protected by their copyright work

Court in Luak, Miri on last Friday as blatant abuse of power and inhumane by the police.\n\nAccording to Aidi, a team from the Miri district police station was sent to the premises at around 9.30am after they received a public tip-off that the stalls there were serving dine-in breakfast to customers.\n\n\u201cAt the premises, the team witnessed that one of the stall operator was in the midst of preparing dine-in dishes for her customers,\u201d said Aidi.\n\nThe team also reported that upon realising the presence of the police, a few of the customers quickly left the premises and a worker quickly cleared-up the table.\n\nAidi said the premises had violated the current SOP of \u2018no dining-in\u2019 as the tables and chairs appeared to have been arranged for dine-in purposes.\n\n\u201cInside the premises, a man was sitting alone at a table and ignored the presence of the police. He also refused to cooperate with the team when questioned,\u201d said Aidi, adding that police had no choice but to issue him a compound.\n\nHe said it was only after the issuance of compound that the man claimed that he was a stall operator and voiced out his dissatisfaction for being issued with a compound.\n\nAidi said the stall operator, who was eating at a table in the premises, had indirectly encouraged other customers to dine-in at the premises.\n\n\u201cFurther checks on the stall operator revealed that he only has a business licence and not a licence from the Miri City Council,\u201d Aidi added.\n\nTherefore, he said what Ling had claimed in his statement was utterly wrong as evidence could be found from the premises\u2019 closed-circuit television (CCTV).\n\n\u201cFrom this, there was no blatant abuse of power and inhumane act by the police as claimed by Ling,\u201d Aidi added.\n\nThe owner of the premise is also urged to handover a copy of the CCTV footage to the police for further investigation under the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Act 1988.\n\nMeanwhile, Aidi said the police are working together with the government in the fight to break the infection chain of the Covid-19 virus in Sarawak.\n\n\u201cThe infection rate of the virus in Sarawak is worrying and everyone is urged to abide to the SOP as set by the Malaysian National Security Council,\u201d he added.", "keyword": ["aidi", "dinein", "senator", "team", "claim", "sop", "abuse", "stall", "miri", "statement", "operator", "act", "premises", "denies", "power", "lings", "chief"], "summary": "\u201cAt the premises, the team witnessed that one of the stall operator was in the midst of preparing dine-in dishes for her customers,\u201d said Aidi.\nHe said it was only after the issuance of compound that the man claimed that he was a stall operator and voiced out his dissatisfaction for being issued with a compound.\nAidi said the stall operator, who was eating at a table in the premises, had indirectly encouraged other customers to dine-in at the premises.\n\u201cFurther checks on the stall operator revealed that he only has a business licence and not a licence from the Miri City Council,\u201d Aidi added.\n\u201cFrom this, there was no blatant abuse of power and inhumane act by the police as claimed by Ling,\u201d Aidi added.", "news": "The Borneo Post", "date": "2021-05-23 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Lead example, Lo tells politicians in curbing Covid-19 pandemic", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWJvcm5lb3Bvc3QuY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvMjIvbGVhZC1leGFtcGxlLWxvLXRlbGxzLXBvbGl0aWNpYW5zLWluLWN1cmJpbmctY292aWQtMTktcGFuZGVtaWMv0gEA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2019/04/Andrew-Lo.jpeg", "text": "KUCHING (May 22): The Malaysian Trade Union Congress (MTUC) Sarawak has demanded for leadership by example in efforts to flatten the Covid-19 pandemic curve in the country.\n\nIts secretary Andrew Lo said until and unless the national and state political leaders step up and demonstrate leadership by example, Malaysia, including Sarawak, will not see an end to the Covid-19 pandemic any time soon.\n\nHe said MTUC Sarawak was quite amused by the Prime Minister\u2019s announcement that the National Security Council will tighten enforcement of the Movement Control Order (MCO) 3.0.\n\nThe Prime Minister, he noted, had inadvertently admitted that there had been loose enforcement the past 15 months.\n\n\u201cMTUC certainly does not condone any non-compliance of the standard operating procedures (SOP) and MCO.\n\n\u201cHowever we must question the many cases of Ministers and very important peoples (VIPs) that appears not to follow these restrictions and got off with a slap of the wrist, at most.\n\n\u201cWe even have Minister that was out of the country for weeks.

Could it be that PBS, just like Warisan, had also rejected Kitingan\u2019s overtures to officially join PN?\u201d he said in a statement today.\n\nKitingan, who heads STAR, a PN component party, had earlier today said he was open to the idea of opposition party Warisan joining the ruling coalition.\n\nThe Keningau MP said STAR was open to the idea and believed everybody should be invited into PN, including Warisan.\n\n\u201cThey have assemblymen who want to serve their constituencies. So, why not do this together?\n\n\u201cGRS is open (to the idea) and we have discussed it actually. Even the chief minister is open to it,\u201d Kitingan said.\n\nAlthough Warisan has rejected Kitingan\u2019s offer, the party has not, however, addressed the invitation initially made by PBS president Maximus Ongkili to join PN.\n\nOngkili had yesterday clarified remarks he made that he was willing to work with any opposition party, including Warisan.\n\nOngkili said his actual intention was to express PBS\u2019 openness to have Warisan cooperate with the state and federal governments to achieve their common development goals for the good of Sabah and Sabahans.\n\nIn his statement today, Siambun said Kitingan should realise that Warisan president Shafie Apdal\u2019s reply on his preference to work with PBS was merely a response to a question by a journalist on whether there had been any discussion with other parties on a potential partnership.\n\n\u201cShafie\u2019s preference to work with PBS was because it shares similar struggles for Sabahans as Warisan and that Ongkili is a long-time personal friend of Shafie and a consistent advocate on Sabah\u2019s rights as well.\n\n\u201cPBS is also a state-based party that had been consistent throughout these years since its formation and had been a victim of party-hopping,\u201d he said, referring to the fall of the PBS government after the state elections in 1994.\n\nSiambun also pointed out that the unique position held by PBS in the government allows it to determine the course and direction of the party without being dictated by others.\n\n\u201cPBS is not an official component member of Barisan Nasional or PN but only supports the government of the day. The support we give is contingent upon ensuring the Malaysia Agreement 1963 is wholly implemented.\n\n\u201cThis could be the reason why Ongkili was given the task to helm the Sabah and Sarawak affairs ministry in the Prime Minister\u2019s Department,\u201d he said.\n\nSiambun also said Warisan did not wish to be associated with PAS that had rejected a bill to amend Article 1(2) of the Federal Constitution.\n\nThe bill was intended to reinstate Sabah and Sarawak to their original status prior to a 1976 constitutional amendment.\n\nHe said Kitingan, whose STAR party is a formal member of PN, also worked closely with PAS, which had outrightly rejected the bill initiated by the late Liew Vui Keong, the former de facto law minister.\n\nHe said Kitingan should clarify why he is willing to work with PAS which has a nominated assemblyman in the Sabah state assembly now.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["open", "laughs", "party", "work", "warisan", "state", "pbs", "pn", "join", "invitation", "kitingan", "rejected", "jeffreys"], "summary": "KOTA KINABALU: State opposition party Warisan has declined an invitation by Perikatan Nasional deputy chairman Jeffrey Kitingan to join the ruling coalition, saying the invite was \u201chumorous\u201d.\nCould it be that PBS, just like Warisan, had also rejected Kitingan\u2019s overtures to officially join PN?\u201d he said in a statement today.\nKitingan, who heads STAR, a PN component party, had earlier today said he was open to the idea of opposition party Warisan joining the ruling coalition.\nThe Keningau MP said STAR was open to the idea and believed everybody should be invited into PN, including Warisan.\nAlthough Warisan has rejected Kitingan\u2019s offer, the party has not, however, addressed the invitation initially made by PBS president Maximus Ongkili to join PN.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-05-21 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "AirAsia\u2019s digital businesses to become Asean\u2019s leading super app", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWFsYXlzaWFucmVzZXJ2ZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNS8yOC9haXJhc2lhcy1kaWdpdGFsLWJ1c2luZXNzZXMtdG8tYmVjb21lLWFzZWFucy1sZWFkaW5nLXN1cGVyLWFwcC_SAW5odHRwczovL3RoZW1hbGF5c2lhbnJlc2VydmUuY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvMjgvYWlyYXNpYXMtZGlnaXRhbC1idXNpbmVzc2VzLXRvLWJlY29tZS1hc2VhbnMtbGVhZGluZy1zdXBlci1hcHAvYW1wLw?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://themalaysianreserve.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/AIRASIA-APP.jpg", "text": "By AZALEA AZUAR / Pic credit: airasia.com\n\nAirAsia Group Bhd\u2019s non-airline digital businesses is on the right track to becoming Asean\u2019s digital travel and lifestyle platform as it meets strong consumer demands.\n\nIts super app is now considered one of the region\u2019s top three online travel agencies (OTA) while AirAsia\u2019s e-wallet BigPay is set to become the first virtual bank and its delivery service Teleport is strengthening.\n\nDuring the group\u2019s first quarter of 2021 (1Q21) financial performance announcement on May 27, AirAsia super app posted a 45% year-on-year (YoY) increase in its revenue to RM10 million supported by solid growth of products and services available on the platform.\n\nTeleport\u2019s revenue has also tripled compared to its 1Q20 performance.\n\nAccording to AirAsia Group CEO Tan Sri Tony Fernandes, just as they revolutionised air travel 20 years ago with their low-cost carrier, AirAsia is now disrupting and democratising the lifestyle industry again through the development of their super app with over 17 travel and products leveraging off one another.\n\n\u201cIn just over a year we are now one of the top three leading online travel agencies (OTAs) in Asean based on website traffic, with over 100 million average page views monthly on airasia.com.\n\n\u201cIn the future, when travel resumes in our key markets, we can guarantee best value prices for our flight and hotel packages because we own our own airline,\u201d he explained in a press release today.\n\nExpansion of its popular products and services to its Asean markets for its super app is in AirAsia\u2019s pipeline.\n\n\u201cWe are working on expanding our health services in Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines, while offering SNAP hotel and accommodation deals in Vietnam and Singapore in the near future,\u201d said Fernandes.\n\nHe also said that Teleport not only provides the usual deliveries but has now been delivering vaccines all over Malaysia and the Asean region. Hence, it has created more than 4,000 delivery driver jobs in 17 key markets.\n\n\u201cWe are also looking forward to converting passenger planes into freighters in the coming months to cater for unprecedented cargo demand,\u201d he said.\n\nFernandes added that the group has plans to improve its BigPay e-wallet to become the best virtual bank in Asean.\n\n\u201cWe are tapping into the full potential of our loyalty platform BIG Rewards, to provide the best range for rewards and redemption in Asean and beyond.\n\n\u201cThrough our digital ecosystem, we have already created thousands of jobs and supported more than 3,500 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Malaysia.\n\n\u201cOur training centre, AirAsia Academy (currently known as Redbeat Academy), offers affordable digital and tech training courses to equip not only our own employees, but also SMEs and members of the public, with skills to bridge the technology gap in Malaysia and beyond in this ever changing digital world,\u201d he said.\n\nApart from AirAsia\u2019s digital services, its other non-airline businesses such as AirAsia Food, AirAsia Fresh, AirAsia Shop and its Santan franchise restaurants are also penetrating into new markets.\n\n\u201cAs we continue to expand our digital footprint in Malaysia and other Asean countries, our contribution in the region will only increase and become more significant from here onwards.\n\n\u201cWe saw the crisis as an opportunity to use the downtime in flying caused by the pandemic to leverage the strength of our database of over 60 million customers and to focus on developing new non airline revenue streams in the key areas of e-commerce, fintech and logistics,\u201d Fernandes commented.\n\nAirAsia has more innovations to roll out such as the ride-hailing \u201cAirAsia Ride\u201d, which will be launched in the coming months, as well as the potential of drone delivery.\n\nThe group is also planning for electric or hydronic aeroplanes to meet consumer\u2019s sustainability needs.\n\n\u201cIn the airline business, Asia Digital Engineering (ADE) is set to become one of the region\u2019s best value aircraft maintenance and overhaul providers for both short term line maintenance and longer-term base maintenance, a space previously dominated by Singapore-based maintenance and overhaul companies (MROs).\n\n\u201cI firmly believe ADE will become the leading aircraft maintenance/overhaul company in the region in the near future with significant potential growth opportunities in Asean and beyond with service excellence and the lowest cost base,\u201d he said.\n\nAirAsia is also working to launch more contactless technologies to make flying a seamless and hygienic experience when it resumes.\n\nThis includes a digital passport called Scan2Fly where passengers can upload required medical documentation and have it verified in real time online, before heading to the airport.\n\nThe group would also be introducing FACES, its biometric facial recognition technology at Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2 (KLIA 2) and it will be rolled out across all key destinations.\n\n\u201cThere is a silver lining to every crisis and the best thing to come out of this pandemic is our recovery as a stronger, more resilient travel and lifestyle platform \u2013 not solely reliant on airfares alone anymore,\u201d said Fernandes.\n\nThe \u201cnew look\u201d AirAsia would be embarking on an exciting new phase of growth, with the right focus and foundations to better meet the needs of the digital revolution.\n\nFernandes stressed that they would remain true to their promise of delivering high quality service serving the underserved by making it affordable to fly, stay, shop, eat and upskill.\n\n\u201cLooking out for the everyday people is what we do best and we aim to continue to support them, not only in the major cities, but also in the smaller cities we serve, where many people are struggling the most and access to products and services are more limited.\u201d", "keyword": ["asean", "maintenance", "aseans", "travel", "services", "super", "app", "airasias", "airasia",

open and detailed revelation of an intrusion by China\u2019s air force has raised many questions that the government needs to answer, says an expert in defence and diplomacy matters.\n\n\u201cThe biggest question is how the government, in particular Wisma Putra, is going to resolve it?\u201d asked the expert, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nThe expert said, however, that the RMAF\u2019s \u201cextremely rare\u201d move to reveal details of the incident which saw its fighter jets being scrambled to intercept 16 People\u2019s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) planes in Malaysia\u2019s maritime zone (ZMM), provided a \u201cgolden opportunity\u201d for the country.\n\nThe source said while the possibility that the PLAAF was carrying out surveillance in the area could not be ruled out, the Chinese could also have been \u201ctesting the waters\u201d over Malaysia\u2019s air defence systems and its reaction.\n\nThe \u201cbreach of Malaysian airspace and sovereignty\u201d \u2013 as foreign affairs minister Hishammuddin Hussein termed it \u2013 by the Chinese aircraft is the latest in a series of actions by China in the disputed South China Sea that has its neighbours worried.\n\nFor years, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei, Taiwan and Vietnam have been contesting China\u2019s claim to almost all of the South China Sea. These countries have often protested against China over what they claimed were intrusions into their territories.\n\nIn recent years, the dispute over the sea has seen a rise in tensions not only between China and these nations but also between China and the US. As recent as May 20, China and the US exchanged strong words over US naval activity in the region.\n\nThe expert asked what the rules of engagement would have been had the Chinese planes not turned back when the RMAF scrambled its jets.\n\n\u201cTypically, when an air force is confronted with such a situation, they would fire a warning shot or resort to aggressive manoeuvres to \u2018force\u2019 the foreign planes to turn back. Were our Hawks armed for engagement? How many Hawks were deployed?\n\n\u201cMy question is why did we scramble our Hawk 208 fighters? Those are advanced trainer jets, light fighter jets. They do not have the same interception capabilities of our Sukhoi Su-30MKM or F/A-18 Hornets.\n\n\u201cAre they airworthy? Or were the Hawks deployed because they are closest to that part of the South China Sea? If so, why are we not stationing more advanced fighters closer to the region?\u201d\n\nHe commended Hishammuddin for saying Wisma Putra would summon the Chinese ambassador to explain the incident.\n\nThe Chinese, the expert said, had already said the flight by the 16 planes was routine training and that it had not entered any other country\u2019s territorial air space under international law.\n\n\u201cEssentially, the Chinese are saying they have done nothing wrong. But Wisma Putra wants an explanation on the breach of Malaysian airspace and sovereignty.\n\n\u201cSo who is telling the truth? And what happens next? Will China apologise? I doubt they will, given their stance on the South China Sea.\u201d\n\nThe expert said if Wisma Putra was not satisfied with China\u2019s explanation and if the country refused to apologise, Malaysia should take the \u201cbold\u201d step of expelling the Chinese ambassador and recalling the Malaysian ambassador in China.\n\n\u201cIn diplomatic lexicon, expelling an ambassador is a very serious statement. I think if we do not do so, we (Malaysia) run the risk of looking weak.\u201d\n\nStill, the expert said, the incident provided Malaysia with the \u201cgolden opportunity\u201d to analyse and address defence issues, including the placement of frontline fighter jets and pattern of violations by foreign forces, particularly in the hotly disputed South China Sea.\n\nMeanwhile, defence analyst Lam Choong Wah said Asean and China were currently negotiating a code of conduct (CoC) for the South China Sea and that these negotiations needed to be sped up to regulate the behaviour of military operations in the region.\n\n\u201cMalaysia should utilise all available diplomatic channels to handle the issue to preserve national interests,\u201d Lam said.\n\n\u201cBeing firm or soft is not the crux of the problem. The core issue is there is no CoC in place to regulate military behavior in disputed areas, and until there is a CoC, military or maritime enforcement standoffs will take place from time to time.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["expert", "force", "wisma", "planes", "south", "malaysian", "chinese", "jets", "chinas", "intrusion", "putrajaya", "resolve", "sea", "putra"], "summary": "\u201cThe biggest question is how the government, in particular Wisma Putra, is going to resolve it?\u201d asked the expert, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.\nFor years, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei, Taiwan and Vietnam have been contesting China\u2019s claim to almost all of the South China Sea.\nThe expert asked what the rules of engagement would have been had the Chinese planes not turned back when the RMAF scrambled its jets.\n\u201cTypically, when an air force is confronted with such a situation, they would fire a warning shot or resort to aggressive manoeuvres to \u2018force\u2019 the foreign planes to turn back.\nBut Wisma Putra wants an explanation on the breach of Malaysian airspace and sovereignty.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-06-03 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Take more from KWAN to help M40, B40 groups, says Najib", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wNi8wMi90YWtlLW1vcmUtZnJvbS1rd2FuLXRvLWhlbHAtbTQwLWI0MC1ncm91cHMtc2F5cy1uYWppYi_SAQA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Fmt Reporters"], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/02-PANIC-BUYING-MC0-3.0.jpg", "text": "PETALING JAYA: Former prime minister Najib Razak has urged the government to take another RM4.2 billion from the National Trust Fund (KWAN) to assist the (bottom 40) B40 and (middle 40) M40 groups during the total lockdown.\n\nIn a Facebook post, he assured that Barisan Nasional would replenish the funds in the future.\n\nNajib also questioned if the current allocation of RM100 each for single Malaysians and RM500 for each B40 household with at least three children was sufficient.\n\n\u201cOn top of that, this assistance comes after they have faced MCO 2.0 and MCO 3.0/3.1 for five months, and now the total lockdown,\u201d he said.\n\nNajib noted that the payments would only come in by the end of June, while the additional RM500 for the Prihatin Special Grant (GKP) recipients was due in July.\n\nHe added that GKP recipients should also be eligible for Bantuan Prihatin Rakyat, as they had the additional burden of bearing the losses faced by their businesses.\n\nNajib said the Perikatan Nasional administration could dip into KWAN again if it wished to avoid borrowing more money, since it had already borrowed over RM100 billion for BPR aid within the first five months of the year.\n\nWith the additional funds from KWAN, Najib said, more could be handed out under the Bantuan Prihatin aid scheme.\n\n\u201cThe RM300 to RM500 will become RM900 to RM1,500 for B40 families.

It\u2019s sad at first, but whatever happened, happened and it\u2019s best to move on and be strong,\u201d said the 33-year-old content creator from Selangor, when we spoke on Sunday (30 May).\n\nFahmi had been confirmed positive with Covid-19 after getting tested at the Covid Assessment Centre (CAC) in Stadium Melawati, Shah Alam on 21 May. That same day, he was sent straight to the PKRC to undergo more than a week of mandatory quarantine.\n\n\u201cI have three days to go. They count it from the day you first did your swab test and 10 days after that.\u201d he explained, mentioning how all of his close contacts were fortunate enough to have not contracted the virus.\n\nSharing his experiences, Fahmi revealed how his body had reacted over the course of his infection.\n\nMy symptoms came in pretty late, each day one symptom. First came the sore throat, fever the day after, then I started to lose my sense of smell and taste, then I started to feel heavy breathing and panting. But nothing serious. That\u2019s why they sent me to MAEPS because here they have the equipment to scan my lungs.\n\nFahmi also said that the medical staff stationed at the PKRC had been very reliable and responsive to his needs and everyone else who\u2019s there.\n\nQuarantine life\n\nWith thousands of other Covid-19 patients confined together at the \u2018DG Hall\u2019 in MAEPS, Fahmi noted his shock when first arriving at the PKRC and said that quarantine life took some getting used to.\n\n\u201cI was of course surprised by the insane number of people here, to the point that there are not enough beds. People have to sleep on mattresses on the floor,\u201d he said, adding that without any appropriate shower facility there, patients also have to contend with long bathroom lines and having to bathe on the toilet.\n\nHowever, despite the minor discomforts, Fahmi said everything at the PKRC had been satisfactory and personally relates life in quarantine to what people might find in boarding schools.\n\n\u201cFood is served three times a day. Breakfast is at 8 am, lunch at 12 noon and dinner at 6 pm.

The key to surviving here is to just make friends to keep yourself sane.\n\nWith the time spent living with a deadly disease and after having been in the Covid-19 isolation camp, Fahmi said that the best way to overcome it all is with positive thinking and not giving up.\n\nI was scared, anything could happen and I was afraid I wasn\u2019t going to come back.

Let\u2019s find out.\n\nThe phone looks pretty good on the back too, so when you\u2019re taking pictures of other people at least they\u2019ll be looking towards you. (Credit: TRP)\n\nA phone catered to selfie enthusiasts\n\nAs advertised by the company, the V21\u2019s main selling point has to be its selfie camera with tonnes of options for you to play with such as adjusting brightness all the way, to toning your cheeks.\n\nAnd apparently, having nifty software tricks is not enough for the Chinese manufacturer as the phone is also fitted with \u2013 wait for it \u2013 two built-in flashlights which the company calls Dual Selfie Spotlight located on the front of the phone.\n\nYou know, just in case you\u2019re in a really, really, dark room and thought that this might be the best time to take a selfie.\n\nCredit: TRP\n\nThe V21 can even guide you on how to take a good selfie \u2013 complete with outlines showing you how to pose and take the shot.\n\nThe back camera is pretty good too if you\u2019re under good sunlight and it has three different lenses for you to choose from.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good in the hand and it\u2019s pretty too\n\nAlthough this phone has a screen size of 6.44 inches, the phone actually feels good in the hand and isn\u2019t super huge thanks to a design that stretches the panel out to the edge of the phone.\n\nIf you\u2019re a bit conservative and want your phone to blend in the background, there\u2019s the Dusk Blue colour option, but if you want it to get everyone\u2019s attention including your own, there\u2019s also Sunset Dazzle which is a real looker.\n\nThe colours on the body of the phone shift when you look at it from different angles which might entice some folks who want their phone to have a slightly funkier colour palette rather than having it just plain old black or white.\n\nCredit: TRP\n\nAll day phone\n\nThe Vivo V21 has quite a slim profile but don\u2019t think that it\u2019s not beefed up in the battery department because the phone can last you a full day even if you\u2019re consuming a lot of content.\n\nThere\u2019s also the option of fast charging if you manage to drain that big battery and they\u2019re not messing about. It\u2019s actually possible to get this thing from 0 to roughly above 50% within half an hour.\n\nCredit: TRP\n\nNot really a gaming phone\n\nThe phone might tick many boxes but gaming is not one of them.\n\nYes, you can play graphic intensive games like COD Mobile or PUBG Mobile, but I noticed that the V21 doesn\u2019t allow you to max out the settings, which might be a dealbreaker for some but if you\u2019re playing casual games, it will work just fine.\n\nShould you get the V21?\n\nIt\u2019s a great phone if you\u2019re someone who likes to take a lot of selfies as this where the phone truly shines. Literally.\n\nThere are not many phones that can say that they have one, let alone two flashes for the front camera and the amount of options is great for those who want to tweak their selfies.\n\nApart from the front camera, the V21 is also capable in other areas such as having a great screen for watching stuff like YouTube or Netflix, a pretty design, and also a large battery with the option of fast charging that borders on ridiculous.\n\nThe Vivo V21 is an affordable package and that not only looks good, but it feels good to use too.\n\nCredit: TRP\n\nShare your thoughts with us via TRP\u2019s Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.", "keyword": ["really", "youre", "camera", "phone", "good", "v21", "pretty", "taking", "having", "selfies", "vivo", "selfie", "review", "option"], "summary": "Vivo recently came out with the V21, a phone that takes aim at those who like to take a lot of selfies.\nBut, is a selfie camera really enough to entice you to get this phone?\nThe phone looks pretty good on the back too, so when you\u2019re taking pictures of other people at least they\u2019ll be looking towards you.\nYou know, just in case you\u2019re in a really, really, dark room and thought that this might be the best time to take a selfie.\nIt\u2019s a great phone if you\u2019re someone who likes to take a lot of selfies as this where the phone truly shines.", "news": "The Rakyat Post", "date": "2021-06-02 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "We need to prepare for the worst, says health DG", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wNS8yNS93ZS1uZWVkLXRvLXByZXBhcmUtZm9yLXRoZS13b3JzdC1zYXlzLWhlYWx0aC1kZy_SAQA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/noor-hisham-abdullah-fmt-080521-2.jpg", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: Health director-general Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah urged the public to prepare for the worst in facing the Covid-19 wave following an exponential trend indicated by the Covid-19 graph in this country.\n\n\u201cThe rise in cases started from April 1 and could trigger a vertical surge.

assured the people of Kapit, Song, Bukit Mabong, and Belaga districts that there are sufficient supplies of essential food items throughout this Gawai Dayak season.\n\nThe ministry\u2019s Kapit chief Al-Redzamani Abdul Razak said 10 items have been listed under the Festive Season Maximum Price Control Scheme (SHMMP) for Gawai until June 3.\n\nThey are live chicken, standard chicken (slaughtered and cleaned with legs, heads, liver and giblets or any part thereof), super chicken (slaughtered and cleaned, without legs, head, liver and giblets), Grade A chicken eggs (weighing between 65g and 69.9g), Grade B chicken eggs (weighing between 60g and 64.9g each), Grade C chicken eggs (weighing between 55g and 59.9g each), live old chicken, chicken wings, pork (belly), and pork (meat and fat).\n\n\u201cBased on our regular inspection and also the feedback from both retailers and suppliers, the supply level is stable and should be sufficient to meet the demands.\n\n\u201cNonetheless, our KPDNHEP teams continue to closely supervise and monitor the selling and buying trends during the current Movement Control Order (MCO) period, as well as to ensure every trader comply strictly with the price-control scheme for Gawai 2021.\n\n\u201cWe aim to advocate a healthy business environment and a win-win situation between the traders and the consumers,\u201d Al Redzamani said in a statement.\n\nHe also warned stern action would await any trader caught raising the price of any of the controlled items during the SHMMP Gawai 2021 period.\n\n\u201cAny consumer who finds any trader not abiding by the scheme, or notices other unscrupulous trading practices, can lodge a report by calling our hotline 1-800-886-800, or send WhatsApp texts via 019-2794317.\n\n\u201cAlso, seek KPDNHEP on Facebook, or go to Kapit KPDNHEP Office behind Meligai Hotel, which is open from 8am to 5pm on every regular working day,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, a survey here yesterday showed many shoppers stocking up not only for the Gawai Dayak celebration, but also for the the statewide MCO, which takes effect today.\n\nThe Terasang Market, Pasar Tani Kapit, Kapit Night Street Market, cold storage, and various supermarkets were crowded with more customers than usual.\n\nA local resident, who wish to be identified only as \u2018Madam Chen\u2019, said her husband reminded her to buy extra vegetables and meat for their family\u2019s consumption over the next few days.\n\n\u201cI bought various green vegetables, some pork, and also fish \u2013- these should last us for the next few days.\n\n\u201cWe, the adults, do not mind much, but the children are the ones who need more food to grow,\u201d the housewife from Jalan Selirik said when met at Terasang Market yesterday.\n\nPenghulu Allan Tubam said he had spent most of his time at his longhouse throughout the various stages of MCO.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t come down to Kapit town, unless there\u2019s some urgent or official duties that have to be attended to.\n\n\u201cI believe in looking after myself and my family as much as possible. I want to protect them from Covid-19. As a community leader, I need to set a good example for my followers,\u201d he said, adding that he and other community leaders had come to get their Covid-19 vaccination.\n\n\u201cThis morning (yesterday), I took the opportunity to buy some extra food, some drinks before returning to my longhouse.\n\n\u201cWith the MCO taking effect on May 29, I wouldn\u2019t do any Gawai shopping.

Earlier today, we were told that Perodua\u2019s Sentral facility in Section 19, Petaling Jaya remained closed, including its after-sales department. According to a source, the company is expected to make an announcement on the matter soon.\n\nLikewise, Edaran Tan Chong Motor (ETCM) announced yesterday via a FB post that all Nissan workshops are temporarily closed, pending application for operation. The company has not yet updated the status of its after-sales activities as of this point.\n\nMeanwhile, Honda dealerships that have obtained approval for after-sales service to continue have begun doing so. However, we were told by a source that not all Honda service centres are operational at this point, although more dealerships are attempting to get approval to operate their SCs. Honda Malaysia had previously announced that it would continue offering after-sales services during the lockdown period.\n\nThis is also the case with workshops and parts businesses, as approval by authorities is needed to open for business. Relevant documents are also necessary to ensure staff meet the necessary travel protocols. With enforcement being reportedly strict, many businesses allowed to operate during the FMCO are choosing to remain closed until they can obtain the necessary approval letters.\n\nEarlier, domestic trade and consumer affairs (KPDNHEP) minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi had stated that service centres as well as vehicle repair (body and paint) facilities would be allowed to operate during the lockdown, at 60% worker capacity. All businesses will have to comply with tight standard operating procedures (SOPs) and all local authority directives.\n\nCar sales have of course stopped during the two-week period, as well as that for vehicle inspections and registrations, as both Puspakom and the road transport department (JPJ) have announced that no business will be done during the lockdown.

According to the statement released by the ministry yesterday, customers can only stay in retail stores or shopping malls for a maximum duration of two hours once the new directive is put in place tomorrow.\n\nSo, who will be responsible for monitoring this time limit? Based on another document that was released earlier today, the responsibility falls on the retail store and shopping mall operators themselves.

A brutal new wave of the Covid-19 epidemic killed a record high 1,290 people last month.\n\nPPK Malaysia\u2019s circular stated that a total of RM30 per person will be charged as administration fee (RM15 per dose) and another RM20 per person for logistic expenditure (RM10 per dose). The RM30 fee for two doses is supposedly paid to ProtectHealth Corporation, a company owned by the Ministry of Health (MOH) that manages private medical practitioners who sign up as vaccinators under PICK.\n\nCodeBlue contacted PPK Malaysia \u2014 which represents major shopping centres in the Klang Valley and other states \u2014 to verify the authenticity of the circular.

We pay private medical practitioners RM14 per dose administered,\u201d Khairul Faizi from the corporate communications unit of ProtectHealth Corp told CodeBlue today.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t supply vaccines as our role is managing the private medical practitioners.

ProtectHealth Corporation \u2013 a Ministry of Health (MOH) owned company whose board includes the Health director-general and MOH secretary-general \u2013 and the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) \u2013 which appears to oversee the so-called \u201ceconomic frontliners vaccination programme\u201d for the retail sector \u2013 have denied collecting payments for the vaccine rollouts by shopping centres.\n\nSo, what are shopping centres collecting the money for? If ProtectHealth is already covering the cost of vaccine administration by paying vaccinators RM14 per dose administered, is the RM50 fee to cover the cost of venue rental for setting up vaccination centres (PPVs) at malls? Even then, this seems excessive.\n\nPharmaniaga Bhd, on the other hand, is expected to immediately deliver Sinovac\u2019s coronavirus vaccines to state governments and the private sector, despite Vaccine Minister Khairy Jamaluddin\u2019s previous assertion that the federal government\u2019s order of 12 million doses must be fulfilled in its entirety \u2013 estimated end July \u2013 before Pharmaniaga begins work on other orders.\n\nWith Health Minister Dr Adham Baba and Senior Defence Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob\u2019s latest statement yesterday (Pharmaniaga is controlled by the Armed Forces Fund Board) on Pharmaniaga\u2019s vaccine distribution to states and companies running parallel with PICK, it is unclear if Pharmaniaga can fully deliver the federal government\u2019s order by the end-July target.\n\nWhy is CITF diverting Covid-19 vaccines away from PICK when we have inoculated just a fraction of the 9.4 million targeted individuals who face the highest risk of developing severe disease or dying from Covid-19 \u2013 the elderly, people with comorbidities, and the disabled community?\n\nAs of May 31, just about two million people have received at least one dose of the vaccine. Assuming that about a million of these individuals are frontline workers from the first phase of PICK and young adults who signed up for the AstraZeneca-Oxford jab (numbers are likely higher), that means Malaysia has vaccinated only a million high-risk individuals, or 11 per cent of the 9.4 million targeted.\n\nCITF has yet to publish statistics on the number of high-risk people who have received Covid-19 vaccines so far.\n\nIn the month of May alone, 1,290 people lost their lives to Covid-19 in Malaysia, nearly triple the 471 fatalities recorded in the whole of last year. Although an increasing number of younger adults are dying from Covid-19 in the new wave of the Malaysian epidemic, the elderly remain the primary victims.\n\nAbout 74 per cent of 1,290 people who died from Covid-19 last month, or 955 individuals, were aged 60 years and above. Nearly nine in 10 victims had underlying health conditions, 75 per cent of whom were aged 60 or older.\n\nDozens of people have been dying from Covid-19 every day in Malaysia in the past three weeks. When hospitals and intensive care units (ICUs) are full, our vaccination strategy should focus on reducing the number of people with Covid-19 requiring hospital or critical care, not to cut infections.\n\nPeople who receive vaccination can still contract Covid-19 and possibly infect others, but all approved coronavirus vaccines prevent severe disease and death.\n\nChasing illusory single-digit daily infections \u2013 or even triple-digit infections at this point \u2013 is an impossible endeavour that will take at least six months or even a year, depending on how fast we can inoculate two-thirds of our adult population. As of yesterday, only about 8 per cent of Malaysia\u2019s adult population has received at least one dose.\n\nIf CITF is now changing its vaccination strategy to focus on working adults to prevent further economically devastating lockdowns, then CITF should make this clear. In a scenario with limited resources \u2013 vaccine supply, manpower to run PPVs, and outreach efforts \u2013 there must be priority groups in whichever strategy, whether it\u2019s to protect the most vulnerable or to keep the economy going.\n\nThe UK recorded zero new Covid-19 deaths yesterday for the first time since July 2020. This achievement came after the UK took about six months to vaccinate nearly 75 per cent of the adult population, or over 39 million people, with at least one vaccine dose.\n\nThe UK\u2019s coronavirus vaccination programme, which opened up in phases according to age, hit its target of offering a first jab to all those in top priority groups \u2013 those aged 50 or older as well as people in high-risk categories \u2013 before April 15.\n\nEngland and Scotland have now started offering first vaccines to people aged 30 and above, while Northern Ireland and Wales have begun vaccinating over-18s. Due to the emergence of the variant first discovered in India, renamed the \u201cDelta\u201d variant, England is accelerating second vaccine doses to adults aged 50 and above.\n\nThe UK has the benefit of most residents, including non-nationals, being registered with its NHS, making it easy to reach out to senior citizens for Covid-19 vaccination. Malaysia, on the other hand, has serious challenges in providing vaccine access to the elderly, many of whom live in the community with their families or on their own instead of care homes.\n\nThe over 62,000 no-shows at Covid-19 vaccination appointments in Kedah, Pahang, Kelantan, Perak, Negeri Sembilan, Melaka, Perlis, and Terengganu \u2013 attributed to lack of transport to PPVs and not checking the MySejahtera app for appointment dates \u2013 illustrate the immense difficulty in reaching the elderly population.\n\nBut this does not mean the government should abandon senior citizens and switch focus to easier targets.

Covid-19 vaccinations onsite at shopping malls for participating retail tenants is not profiteering, the Malaysia Shopping Malls Association (PPK Malaysia) said today.\n\nInstead, the association representing shopping malls claimed that the actual estimated cost for logistics and the health personnel needed to administer the Covid-19 vaccines could go up to RM100 and even RM150, and that the malls had actually decided to subsidise the cost with plans to only collect RM50.\n\nPPK Malaysia was speaking of the plans to have onsite Covid-19 vaccination at shopping malls for employees of retail outlets in the malls, through a \u201cpublic-private sector partnership\u201d model.\n\nWhile confirming that the Covid-19 vaccines will be provided by the Malaysian government for free under this partnership PPK Malaysia said shopping malls will be paying for the fees for doctors, nurses and medical officers to Health Ministry-owned ProtectHealth Corporation and all other antecedent costs.\n\nEarlier this week, notices had circulated on social media of purported plans by shopping malls to offer Covid-19 vaccination to retail tenants\u2019 staff at RM50 per person for two doses (with some giving a breakdown of RM15 for administration per dose and RM10 for logistics per dose).\n\nPPK Malaysia said the planned collection of RM50 was meant partly to secure commitment by retail staff to ensure that they would show up for the vaccination, as well as to pay for the services of administering the Covid-19 vaccine to be provided by the private healthcare providers coordinated by ProtectHealth Corporation.\n\n\u201cOur Association members estimated that the cost of providing the venue, logistics, manpower, standby ambulance service etc for the on-site vaccination centre will amount to RM100 to RM150 per pax, depending on volume and total number of doses available each day, the total population to be vaccinated and the duration to complete all the doses.\n\n\u201cIn the interests of the national agenda, it was decided that the malls shall largely subsidise these costs and be allowed to charge merely RM10 x 2 doses = RM20 per pax to partially defray their expenses and as a commitment by the registrant so as to mitigate absenteeism, leading to wastage of vaccines which would otherwise could be administered to those yet to be scheduled and in order to reach herd immunity of the community in the shortest possible time.\n\n\u201cWe were also informed that the doctors and nurses providing their service will be allocated by the Protect Health Corporation who will charge to administer per dose at RM15.\n\n\u201cTherefore, at RM15 per dose x 2 doses equalling RM30, plus the above nominal sum of RM20 to partially defray logistic expenses, a total of RM50 for 2 doses will be charged to participants, principally only our shopping frontliners,\u201d the shopping malls association explained in a statement today.\n\nCovid-19 vaccination urgently needed, speed is key\n\nIn the same statement, PPK Malaysia said it appreciates shopping malls for recognising the need to subsidise the Covid-19 vaccination costs for retail frontliners, in order to protect the retail industry through immunisation and as an overall corporate social responsibility (CSR) contribution towards the national agenda of urgently achieving herd immunity.\n\n\u201cIt has been proven in several overseas countries that the speed of vaccinations is the way to bring down the rate of infections, coupled with self-discipline and strict adherence to SOPs instead of prolonging the need for further MCOs,\u201d it said, referring to the movement control orders (MCO) in the country.\n\nNoting that the Covid-19 vaccination for the public is being planned on a different schedule, the association said the primary purpose for the partnership with the government was to vaccinate all employees of shopping malls and malls\u2019 business outlets, adding that it is believed that the malls would be \u201cmuch safer places for the public to shop with confidence and with peace of mind\u201d once such vaccination is carried out.\n\n\u201cDespite our good intentions, we are distraught with the negative comments in the media that malls are profiteering from this exercise which is extremely far from the truth,\u201d it said, adding that this statement was issued in order to correct and put the record straight.\n\nIt noted that the \u201curgent need for access to vaccination\u201d was reflected in the shopping malls\u2019 \u201centhusiastic participation\u201d and the \u201coverwhelming registration\u201d by mall employees and mall tenants for the proposed onsite Covid-19 vaccination at malls.\n\n\u201cWe truly look forward to the success of this win-win collaboration with the authorities towards the national objective of achieving herd immunity urgently and the ultimate recovery of the economy in due course,\u201d the association said.\n\nEarlier in the statement, PPK Malaysia explained the reasoning for the idea of vaccinating mall tenants\u2019 staff onsite at shopping malls, while also providing updates on the progress of this plan.\n\nCiting the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi\u2019s May 28 announcement of plans to vaccinate an estimated 500,000 employees in the retail industry under the country\u2019s economic frontliners (retail sector) Covid-19 immunisation programme, PPK Malaysia said it lauded the government\u2019s targeting of the relevant economic sectors to speed up the Covid-19 vaccination programme.\n\n\u201cShopping malls together with all retail tenants\u2019 staff are effectively frontliners and we feel that it is imperative for the vaccination exercise to be implemented expeditiously. When vaccinated, our frontliners will not only protect themselves but more importantly, duly protect the shoppers and the public.\n\n\u201cWe are also appreciative that our proposal for on-site vaccination centres at shopping malls is adopted as it is more efficient and logical to bring the medical personnel to come on-site to administer the vaccinations instead of all the staff having to take time off work to travel to outside vaccination centres, thus interrupting business and daily operations,\u201d PPK Malaysia said.\n\nIn the May 28 statement by the KPDNHEP minister, he too had spoken of his ministry\u2019s cooperation with the Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) for the vaccination of \u201ceconomic frontliners\u201d in the retail sector expected to start in June, and had also spoke on discussions involving CITF on the same day with 60 representatives from the retail industry.\n\nThe minister had also on May 28 spoken of his ministry\u2019s cooperation with PPK Malaysia, the Malaysia Retailers Association (MRA), and Malaysia Retail Chain Association (MRCA) to establish Covid-19 vaccination centres (PPVs) at strategic locations nationwide, while also urging all retail companies to join this vaccination programme to help achieve the government\u2019s target of vaccinating 80 per cent of the population before the year ends.\n\nToday, PPK Malaysia said such an initiative in collaboration with the authorities has received \u201centhusiastic response\u201d from its members malls and retailers, noting that more than 50 malls have already notified their interest to host PPVs nationwide.\n\n\u201cDetails of this programme and the confirmed locations are being finalised and will be announced, once approved in due course, and we do look forward to the rollout by end of June 2021 onwards as scheduled,\u201d it said, having noted that it had already had several meetings with the authorities on this public-private sector partnership for Covid-19 vaccination.\n\nAbout ProtectHealth Corporation\n\nOn its website, ProtectHealth Corporation Sdn Bhd states that the not-for-profit company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Health Ministry\u2019s ProtectHealth Malaysia. It further states that it was appointed by the ministry to implement the participation of private medical practitioners in the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme.\n\nBased on information on ProtectHealth\u2019s website, private general practitioners do not need to pay to participate in the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme, but would have to receive training and also prepare their own personal protective equipment.\n\nThe website also states that ProtectHealth would pay general practitioners RM14 for their administration of each dose of Covid-19 vaccines through clinic and community outreach models, while payment of RM45 per hour would be paid to them for Covid-19 vaccination under government-organised mass vaccination models.\n\nProtectHealth Corporation denied collecting payments from shopping centres purportedly rolling out Covid-19 inoculation drives with vaccinators from ProtectHealth Corp.\n\n\u201cProtectHealth involvement remains the same for all vaccination centres. We pay private medical practitioners RM14 per dose administered,\u201d Khairul Faizi from the corporate communications unit of ProtectHealth Corp told CodeBlue today.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t supply vaccines as our role is managing the private medical practitioners. The vaccine supply is done by the government, similar to other vaccination centres.\u201d\n\nHealth news portal CodeBlue yesterday reported ProtectHealth Corporation as stating its role as merely managing the private medical practitioners carrying out Covid-19 vaccination work and that it pays RM14 per dose administered to such private healthcare personnel.\n\nCodeBlue yesterday also reported ProtectHealth Corporation as denying collecting payments from shopping malls for Covid-19 vaccination in collaboration with the company. \u2013 MalayMail", "keyword": ["shopping", "fee",

a landmark decision, the Intellectual Property High Court in Kuala Lumpur has declared that the sale, offer for sale, distribution and/or supply of TV Boxes or illicit streaming devices (ISDs) that can provide unauthorised access to copyrighted works, constitutes copyright infringement under the Copyright Act 1987.\n\nThe action in the Intellectual Property High Court was brought by satellite operator Measat Broadcast Networks, the service provider for Malaysian pay-TV platform Astro, against a seller of ISDs preloaded with applications which act as gateways to websites or content servers streaming pirated content.\n\nThe historic judgment, considered to be the first by the Intellectual Property High Court, is positively received by the authorities and industry players in their battle against digital piracy. Industry leaders including Astro laud the High Court\u2019s judgement as a bold step in the right direction against piracy in Malaysia.\n\n\u201cThe declaration by the High Court that sale of ISD which allows access to unauthorised copyright content amounts to copyright infringement sets a precedent for future civil claims on copyright infringement against ISD sellers in the market, including those on e-commerce platforms,\u201d stated Laila Saat, Director, Regulatory of Astro. \u201cThis ground-breaking declaration will strengthen intellectual property protection in the country and ongoing anti-piracy efforts, which are pivotal to ensure continuous investment and job creation in Malaysia\u2019s media and entertainment industry. We will continue to work with authorities and content partners to send a strong message that content piracy is theft, illegal and punishable by law.\u201d\n\n\u201cMCMC welcomes the court\u2019s decision, this will strengthen the legal aspects in protecting copyright infringement and battle against piracy, especially in digital and networked forms,\u201d added Zulkarnain Mohd Yasin, Chief Regulatory Officer of the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC).\n\n\u201cAcknowledging that more proactive action is needed to fight digital piracy in the country, FINAS expresses full support for legal action taken by Astro against ISD sellers and all digital piracy activities as these illegal activities has caused the local creative industry a huge loss in revenue every year,\u201d commented Dr. Ahmad Idham Ahmad Nadzri, CEO of the National Film Development Corporation Malaysia (FINAS). \u201cIn driving more holistic and effective strategy battling digital piracy, FINAS has established the Digital Piracy Eradication Committee with the collective support and involvement of relevant law enforcement agencies to further empower and strengthen enforcement, regulations and the terms of distribution licences in line with the provisions under the FINAS Act 244 1981\u201d.\n\n\u201cMyIPO looks forward for cases concerning ISDs to be brought forward to the Malaysian court,\u201d said Zulkarnain Muhammad, Deputy Director General of the Intellectual Property Corporation of Malaysia (MyIPO). \u201cPrevalent and widespread use of ISDs cause far more economic harm than physical copyright piracy. These devices are part of a wider network of online copyright piracy, which will in the long run disincentive original creators from producing creative work. Copyright piracy in any form should be curbed and deterred.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision is the correct one and we welcome it whole-heartedly,\u201d declared Louis Boswell, CEO of the Asia Video Industry Association (AVIA). \u201cContent is not made for free, and it is the right of creators and distributors to charge for it. To circumvent this and steal it is theft, and I see little difference between the theft of physical goods and the theft of video streams. As a society we need to do more to recognise theft for what it is and this ruling is a strong step in that direction.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is an important and welcome declaration by the Intellectual Property High Court, and sends a clear message that the sale of ISDs that provide unauthorised access to copyrighted works constitutes copyright infringement,\u201d asserted Kevin Plumb, Premier League Director of Legal Services. \u201cThe Premier League is committed to pursuing all those involved with providing illegal access to Premier League content as well as working to raise awareness of the risks fans face when watching via unauthorised sources. We will continue to work with Astro and local authorities as part of our ongoing anti-piracy programme in Malaysia.\u201d\n\nThe estimated loss to the industry and Malaysian economy due to piracy is over RM3 billion (\u20ac590m) annually with RM500 million in taxes and thousands of jobs at risk.\n\nThe declaration by the High Court follows recent criminal cases successfully brought against ISD retailers. On February 8th, a company director of an IT company was charged at the Shah Alam Sessions Court under Section 41 (1) (ha) of the Copyright Act 1987 with promoting Long TV Android boxes which allow the bypassing of technological protection measures on copyright broadcast work. On February 16th, a woman director of a mobile accessory company pleaded guilty to a charge of possessing TV media boxes that contains software to illegally stream Astro\u2019s content via the Internet. She was fined RM30,000 under Section 232(2) of the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998, making her the first ISD seller to be charged under this provision.\n\nThe Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) reiterated that it will take stern action against suppliers and sellers who misuse devices and software to illegally access content protected by their copyright work

Court in Luak, Miri on last Friday as blatant abuse of power and inhumane by the police.\n\nAccording to Aidi, a team from the Miri district police station was sent to the premises at around 9.30am after they received a public tip-off that the stalls there were serving dine-in breakfast to customers.\n\n\u201cAt the premises, the team witnessed that one of the stall operator was in the midst of preparing dine-in dishes for her customers,\u201d said Aidi.\n\nThe team also reported that upon realising the presence of the police, a few of the customers quickly left the premises and a worker quickly cleared-up the table.\n\nAidi said the premises had violated the current SOP of \u2018no dining-in\u2019 as the tables and chairs appeared to have been arranged for dine-in purposes.\n\n\u201cInside the premises, a man was sitting alone at a table and ignored the presence of the police. He also refused to cooperate with the team when questioned,\u201d said Aidi, adding that police had no choice but to issue him a compound.\n\nHe said it was only after the issuance of compound that the man claimed that he was a stall operator and voiced out his dissatisfaction for being issued with a compound.\n\nAidi said the stall operator, who was eating at a table in the premises, had indirectly encouraged other customers to dine-in at the premises.\n\n\u201cFurther checks on the stall operator revealed that he only has a business licence and not a licence from the Miri City Council,\u201d Aidi added.\n\nTherefore, he said what Ling had claimed in his statement was utterly wrong as evidence could be found from the premises\u2019 closed-circuit television (CCTV).\n\n\u201cFrom this, there was no blatant abuse of power and inhumane act by the police as claimed by Ling,\u201d Aidi added.\n\nThe owner of the premise is also urged to handover a copy of the CCTV footage to the police for further investigation under the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Act 1988.\n\nMeanwhile, Aidi said the police are working together with the government in the fight to break the infection chain of the Covid-19 virus in Sarawak.\n\n\u201cThe infection rate of the virus in Sarawak is worrying and everyone is urged to abide to the SOP as set by the Malaysian National Security Council,\u201d he added.", "keyword": ["aidi", "dinein", "senator", "team", "claim", "sop", "abuse", "stall", "miri", "statement", "operator", "act", "premises", "denies", "power", "lings", "chief"], "summary": "\u201cAt the premises, the team witnessed that one of the stall operator was in the midst of preparing dine-in dishes for her customers,\u201d said Aidi.\nHe said it was only after the issuance of compound that the man claimed that he was a stall operator and voiced out his dissatisfaction for being issued with a compound.\nAidi said the stall operator, who was eating at a table in the premises, had indirectly encouraged other customers to dine-in at the premises.\n\u201cFurther checks on the stall operator revealed that he only has a business licence and not a licence from the Miri City Council,\u201d Aidi added.\n\u201cFrom this, there was no blatant abuse of power and inhumane act by the police as claimed by Ling,\u201d Aidi added.", "news": "The Borneo Post", "date": "2021-05-23 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Lead example, Lo tells politicians in curbing Covid-19 pandemic", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWJvcm5lb3Bvc3QuY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvMjIvbGVhZC1leGFtcGxlLWxvLXRlbGxzLXBvbGl0aWNpYW5zLWluLWN1cmJpbmctY292aWQtMTktcGFuZGVtaWMv0gEA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2019/04/Andrew-Lo.jpeg", "text": "KUCHING (May 22): The Malaysian Trade Union Congress (MTUC) Sarawak has demanded for leadership by example in efforts to flatten the Covid-19 pandemic curve in the country.\n\nIts secretary Andrew Lo said until and unless the national and state political leaders step up and demonstrate leadership by example, Malaysia, including Sarawak, will not see an end to the Covid-19 pandemic any time soon.\n\nHe said MTUC Sarawak was quite amused by the Prime Minister\u2019s announcement that the National Security Council will tighten enforcement of the Movement Control Order (MCO) 3.0.\n\nThe Prime Minister, he noted, had inadvertently admitted that there had been loose enforcement the past 15 months.\n\n\u201cMTUC certainly does not condone any non-compliance of the standard operating procedures (SOP) and MCO.\n\n\u201cHowever we must question the many cases of Ministers and very important peoples (VIPs) that appears not to follow these restrictions and got off with a slap of the wrist, at most.\n\n\u201cWe even have Minister that was out of the country for weeks.

Could it be that PBS, just like Warisan, had also rejected Kitingan\u2019s overtures to officially join PN?\u201d he said in a statement today.\n\nKitingan, who heads STAR, a PN component party, had earlier today said he was open to the idea of opposition party Warisan joining the ruling coalition.\n\nThe Keningau MP said STAR was open to the idea and believed everybody should be invited into PN, including Warisan.\n\n\u201cThey have assemblymen who want to serve their constituencies. So, why not do this together?\n\n\u201cGRS is open (to the idea) and we have discussed it actually. Even the chief minister is open to it,\u201d Kitingan said.\n\nAlthough Warisan has rejected Kitingan\u2019s offer, the party has not, however, addressed the invitation initially made by PBS president Maximus Ongkili to join PN.\n\nOngkili had yesterday clarified remarks he made that he was willing to work with any opposition party, including Warisan.\n\nOngkili said his actual intention was to express PBS\u2019 openness to have Warisan cooperate with the state and federal governments to achieve their common development goals for the good of Sabah and Sabahans.\n\nIn his statement today, Siambun said Kitingan should realise that Warisan president Shafie Apdal\u2019s reply on his preference to work with PBS was merely a response to a question by a journalist on whether there had been any discussion with other parties on a potential partnership.\n\n\u201cShafie\u2019s preference to work with PBS was because it shares similar struggles for Sabahans as Warisan and that Ongkili is a long-time personal friend of Shafie and a consistent advocate on Sabah\u2019s rights as well.\n\n\u201cPBS is also a state-based party that had been consistent throughout these years since its formation and had been a victim of party-hopping,\u201d he said, referring to the fall of the PBS government after the state elections in 1994.\n\nSiambun also pointed out that the unique position held by PBS in the government allows it to determine the course and direction of the party without being dictated by others.\n\n\u201cPBS is not an official component member of Barisan Nasional or PN but only supports the government of the day. The support we give is contingent upon ensuring the Malaysia Agreement 1963 is wholly implemented.\n\n\u201cThis could be the reason why Ongkili was given the task to helm the Sabah and Sarawak affairs ministry in the Prime Minister\u2019s Department,\u201d he said.\n\nSiambun also said Warisan did not wish to be associated with PAS that had rejected a bill to amend Article 1(2) of the Federal Constitution.\n\nThe bill was intended to reinstate Sabah and Sarawak to their original status prior to a 1976 constitutional amendment.\n\nHe said Kitingan, whose STAR party is a formal member of PN, also worked closely with PAS, which had outrightly rejected the bill initiated by the late Liew Vui Keong, the former de facto law minister.\n\nHe said Kitingan should clarify why he is willing to work with PAS which has a nominated assemblyman in the Sabah state assembly now.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["open", "laughs", "party", "work", "warisan", "state", "pbs", "pn", "join", "invitation", "kitingan", "rejected", "jeffreys"], "summary": "KOTA KINABALU: State opposition party Warisan has declined an invitation by Perikatan Nasional deputy chairman Jeffrey Kitingan to join the ruling coalition, saying the invite was \u201chumorous\u201d.\nCould it be that PBS, just like Warisan, had also rejected Kitingan\u2019s overtures to officially join PN?\u201d he said in a statement today.\nKitingan, who heads STAR, a PN component party, had earlier today said he was open to the idea of opposition party Warisan joining the ruling coalition.\nThe Keningau MP said STAR was open to the idea and believed everybody should be invited into PN, including Warisan.\nAlthough Warisan has rejected Kitingan\u2019s offer, the party has not, however, addressed the invitation initially made by PBS president Maximus Ongkili to join PN.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-05-21 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "AirAsia\u2019s digital businesses to become Asean\u2019s leading super app", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWFsYXlzaWFucmVzZXJ2ZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNS8yOC9haXJhc2lhcy1kaWdpdGFsLWJ1c2luZXNzZXMtdG8tYmVjb21lLWFzZWFucy1sZWFkaW5nLXN1cGVyLWFwcC_SAW5odHRwczovL3RoZW1hbGF5c2lhbnJlc2VydmUuY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvMjgvYWlyYXNpYXMtZGlnaXRhbC1idXNpbmVzc2VzLXRvLWJlY29tZS1hc2VhbnMtbGVhZGluZy1zdXBlci1hcHAvYW1wLw?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://themalaysianreserve.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/AIRASIA-APP.jpg", "text": "By AZALEA AZUAR / Pic credit: airasia.com\n\nAirAsia Group Bhd\u2019s non-airline digital businesses is on the right track to becoming Asean\u2019s digital travel and lifestyle platform as it meets strong consumer demands.\n\nIts super app is now considered one of the region\u2019s top three online travel agencies (OTA) while AirAsia\u2019s e-wallet BigPay is set to become the first virtual bank and its delivery service Teleport is strengthening.\n\nDuring the group\u2019s first quarter of 2021 (1Q21) financial performance announcement on May 27, AirAsia super app posted a 45% year-on-year (YoY) increase in its revenue to RM10 million supported by solid growth of products and services available on the platform.\n\nTeleport\u2019s revenue has also tripled compared to its 1Q20 performance.\n\nAccording to AirAsia Group CEO Tan Sri Tony Fernandes, just as they revolutionised air travel 20 years ago with their low-cost carrier, AirAsia is now disrupting and democratising the lifestyle industry again through the development of their super app with over 17 travel and products leveraging off one another.\n\n\u201cIn just over a year we are now one of the top three leading online travel agencies (OTAs) in Asean based on website traffic, with over 100 million average page views monthly on airasia.com.\n\n\u201cIn the future, when travel resumes in our key markets, we can guarantee best value prices for our flight and hotel packages because we own our own airline,\u201d he explained in a press release today.\n\nExpansion of its popular products and services to its Asean markets for its super app is in AirAsia\u2019s pipeline.\n\n\u201cWe are working on expanding our health services in Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines, while offering SNAP hotel and accommodation deals in Vietnam and Singapore in the near future,\u201d said Fernandes.\n\nHe also said that Teleport not only provides the usual deliveries but has now been delivering vaccines all over Malaysia and the Asean region. Hence, it has created more than 4,000 delivery driver jobs in 17 key markets.\n\n\u201cWe are also looking forward to converting passenger planes into freighters in the coming months to cater for unprecedented cargo demand,\u201d he said.\n\nFernandes added that the group has plans to improve its BigPay e-wallet to become the best virtual bank in Asean.\n\n\u201cWe are tapping into the full potential of our loyalty platform BIG Rewards, to provide the best range for rewards and redemption in Asean and beyond.\n\n\u201cThrough our digital ecosystem, we have already created thousands of jobs and supported more than 3,500 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Malaysia.\n\n\u201cOur training centre, AirAsia Academy (currently known as Redbeat Academy), offers affordable digital and tech training courses to equip not only our own employees, but also SMEs and members of the public, with skills to bridge the technology gap in Malaysia and beyond in this ever changing digital world,\u201d he said.\n\nApart from AirAsia\u2019s digital services, its other non-airline businesses such as AirAsia Food, AirAsia Fresh, AirAsia Shop and its Santan franchise restaurants are also penetrating into new markets.\n\n\u201cAs we continue to expand our digital footprint in Malaysia and other Asean countries, our contribution in the region will only increase and become more significant from here onwards.\n\n\u201cWe saw the crisis as an opportunity to use the downtime in flying caused by the pandemic to leverage the strength of our database of over 60 million customers and to focus on developing new non airline revenue streams in the key areas of e-commerce, fintech and logistics,\u201d Fernandes commented.\n\nAirAsia has more innovations to roll out such as the ride-hailing \u201cAirAsia Ride\u201d, which will be launched in the coming months, as well as the potential of drone delivery.\n\nThe group is also planning for electric or hydronic aeroplanes to meet consumer\u2019s sustainability needs.\n\n\u201cIn the airline business, Asia Digital Engineering (ADE) is set to become one of the region\u2019s best value aircraft maintenance and overhaul providers for both short term line maintenance and longer-term base maintenance, a space previously dominated by Singapore-based maintenance and overhaul companies (MROs).\n\n\u201cI firmly believe ADE will become the leading aircraft maintenance/overhaul company in the region in the near future with significant potential growth opportunities in Asean and beyond with service excellence and the lowest cost base,\u201d he said.\n\nAirAsia is also working to launch more contactless technologies to make flying a seamless and hygienic experience when it resumes.\n\nThis includes a digital passport called Scan2Fly where passengers can upload required medical documentation and have it verified in real time online, before heading to the airport.\n\nThe group would also be introducing FACES, its biometric facial recognition technology at Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2 (KLIA 2) and it will be rolled out across all key destinations.\n\n\u201cThere is a silver lining to every crisis and the best thing to come out of this pandemic is our recovery as a stronger, more resilient travel and lifestyle platform \u2013 not solely reliant on airfares alone anymore,\u201d said Fernandes.\n\nThe \u201cnew look\u201d AirAsia would be embarking on an exciting new phase of growth, with the right focus and foundations to better meet the needs of the digital revolution.\n\nFernandes stressed that they would remain true to their promise of delivering high quality service serving the underserved by making it affordable to fly, stay, shop, eat and upskill.\n\n\u201cLooking out for the everyday people is what we do best and we aim to continue to support them, not only in the major cities, but also in the smaller cities we serve, where many people are struggling the most and access to products and services are more limited.\u201d", "keyword": ["asean", "maintenance", "aseans", "travel", "services", "super", "app", "airasias", "airasia",

open and detailed revelation of an intrusion by China\u2019s air force has raised many questions that the government needs to answer, says an expert in defence and diplomacy matters.\n\n\u201cThe biggest question is how the government, in particular Wisma Putra, is going to resolve it?\u201d asked the expert, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nThe expert said, however, that the RMAF\u2019s \u201cextremely rare\u201d move to reveal details of the incident which saw its fighter jets being scrambled to intercept 16 People\u2019s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) planes in Malaysia\u2019s maritime zone (ZMM), provided a \u201cgolden opportunity\u201d for the country.\n\nThe source said while the possibility that the PLAAF was carrying out surveillance in the area could not be ruled out, the Chinese could also have been \u201ctesting the waters\u201d over Malaysia\u2019s air defence systems and its reaction.\n\nThe \u201cbreach of Malaysian airspace and sovereignty\u201d \u2013 as foreign affairs minister Hishammuddin Hussein termed it \u2013 by the Chinese aircraft is the latest in a series of actions by China in the disputed South China Sea that has its neighbours worried.\n\nFor years, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei, Taiwan and Vietnam have been contesting China\u2019s claim to almost all of the South China Sea. These countries have often protested against China over what they claimed were intrusions into their territories.\n\nIn recent years, the dispute over the sea has seen a rise in tensions not only between China and these nations but also between China and the US. As recent as May 20, China and the US exchanged strong words over US naval activity in the region.\n\nThe expert asked what the rules of engagement would have been had the Chinese planes not turned back when the RMAF scrambled its jets.\n\n\u201cTypically, when an air force is confronted with such a situation, they would fire a warning shot or resort to aggressive manoeuvres to \u2018force\u2019 the foreign planes to turn back. Were our Hawks armed for engagement? How many Hawks were deployed?\n\n\u201cMy question is why did we scramble our Hawk 208 fighters? Those are advanced trainer jets, light fighter jets. They do not have the same interception capabilities of our Sukhoi Su-30MKM or F/A-18 Hornets.\n\n\u201cAre they airworthy? Or were the Hawks deployed because they are closest to that part of the South China Sea? If so, why are we not stationing more advanced fighters closer to the region?\u201d\n\nHe commended Hishammuddin for saying Wisma Putra would summon the Chinese ambassador to explain the incident.\n\nThe Chinese, the expert said, had already said the flight by the 16 planes was routine training and that it had not entered any other country\u2019s territorial air space under international law.\n\n\u201cEssentially, the Chinese are saying they have done nothing wrong. But Wisma Putra wants an explanation on the breach of Malaysian airspace and sovereignty.\n\n\u201cSo who is telling the truth? And what happens next? Will China apologise? I doubt they will, given their stance on the South China Sea.\u201d\n\nThe expert said if Wisma Putra was not satisfied with China\u2019s explanation and if the country refused to apologise, Malaysia should take the \u201cbold\u201d step of expelling the Chinese ambassador and recalling the Malaysian ambassador in China.\n\n\u201cIn diplomatic lexicon, expelling an ambassador is a very serious statement. I think if we do not do so, we (Malaysia) run the risk of looking weak.\u201d\n\nStill, the expert said, the incident provided Malaysia with the \u201cgolden opportunity\u201d to analyse and address defence issues, including the placement of frontline fighter jets and pattern of violations by foreign forces, particularly in the hotly disputed South China Sea.\n\nMeanwhile, defence analyst Lam Choong Wah said Asean and China were currently negotiating a code of conduct (CoC) for the South China Sea and that these negotiations needed to be sped up to regulate the behaviour of military operations in the region.\n\n\u201cMalaysia should utilise all available diplomatic channels to handle the issue to preserve national interests,\u201d Lam said.\n\n\u201cBeing firm or soft is not the crux of the problem. The core issue is there is no CoC in place to regulate military behavior in disputed areas, and until there is a CoC, military or maritime enforcement standoffs will take place from time to time.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["expert", "force", "wisma", "planes", "south", "malaysian", "chinese", "jets", "chinas", "intrusion", "putrajaya", "resolve", "sea", "putra"], "summary": "\u201cThe biggest question is how the government, in particular Wisma Putra, is going to resolve it?\u201d asked the expert, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.\nFor years, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei, Taiwan and Vietnam have been contesting China\u2019s claim to almost all of the South China Sea.\nThe expert asked what the rules of engagement would have been had the Chinese planes not turned back when the RMAF scrambled its jets.\n\u201cTypically, when an air force is confronted with such a situation, they would fire a warning shot or resort to aggressive manoeuvres to \u2018force\u2019 the foreign planes to turn back.\nBut Wisma Putra wants an explanation on the breach of Malaysian airspace and sovereignty.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-06-03 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Take more from KWAN to help M40, B40 groups, says Najib", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wNi8wMi90YWtlLW1vcmUtZnJvbS1rd2FuLXRvLWhlbHAtbTQwLWI0MC1ncm91cHMtc2F5cy1uYWppYi_SAQA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Fmt Reporters"], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/02-PANIC-BUYING-MC0-3.0.jpg", "text": "PETALING JAYA: Former prime minister Najib Razak has urged the government to take another RM4.2 billion from the National Trust Fund (KWAN) to assist the (bottom 40) B40 and (middle 40) M40 groups during the total lockdown.\n\nIn a Facebook post, he assured that Barisan Nasional would replenish the funds in the future.\n\nNajib also questioned if the current allocation of RM100 each for single Malaysians and RM500 for each B40 household with at least three children was sufficient.\n\n\u201cOn top of that, this assistance comes after they have faced MCO 2.0 and MCO 3.0/3.1 for five months, and now the total lockdown,\u201d he said.\n\nNajib noted that the payments would only come in by the end of June, while the additional RM500 for the Prihatin Special Grant (GKP) recipients was due in July.\n\nHe added that GKP recipients should also be eligible for Bantuan Prihatin Rakyat, as they had the additional burden of bearing the losses faced by their businesses.\n\nNajib said the Perikatan Nasional administration could dip into KWAN again if it wished to avoid borrowing more money, since it had already borrowed over RM100 billion for BPR aid within the first five months of the year.\n\nWith the additional funds from KWAN, Najib said, more could be handed out under the Bantuan Prihatin aid scheme.\n\n\u201cThe RM300 to RM500 will become RM900 to RM1,500 for B40 families.

It\u2019s sad at first, but whatever happened, happened and it\u2019s best to move on and be strong,\u201d said the 33-year-old content creator from Selangor, when we spoke on Sunday (30 May).\n\nFahmi had been confirmed positive with Covid-19 after getting tested at the Covid Assessment Centre (CAC) in Stadium Melawati, Shah Alam on 21 May. That same day, he was sent straight to the PKRC to undergo more than a week of mandatory quarantine.\n\n\u201cI have three days to go. They count it from the day you first did your swab test and 10 days after that.\u201d he explained, mentioning how all of his close contacts were fortunate enough to have not contracted the virus.\n\nSharing his experiences, Fahmi revealed how his body had reacted over the course of his infection.\n\nMy symptoms came in pretty late, each day one symptom. First came the sore throat, fever the day after, then I started to lose my sense of smell and taste, then I started to feel heavy breathing and panting. But nothing serious. That\u2019s why they sent me to MAEPS because here they have the equipment to scan my lungs.\n\nFahmi also said that the medical staff stationed at the PKRC had been very reliable and responsive to his needs and everyone else who\u2019s there.\n\nQuarantine life\n\nWith thousands of other Covid-19 patients confined together at the \u2018DG Hall\u2019 in MAEPS, Fahmi noted his shock when first arriving at the PKRC and said that quarantine life took some getting used to.\n\n\u201cI was of course surprised by the insane number of people here, to the point that there are not enough beds. People have to sleep on mattresses on the floor,\u201d he said, adding that without any appropriate shower facility there, patients also have to contend with long bathroom lines and having to bathe on the toilet.\n\nHowever, despite the minor discomforts, Fahmi said everything at the PKRC had been satisfactory and personally relates life in quarantine to what people might find in boarding schools.\n\n\u201cFood is served three times a day. Breakfast is at 8 am, lunch at 12 noon and dinner at 6 pm.

The key to surviving here is to just make friends to keep yourself sane.\n\nWith the time spent living with a deadly disease and after having been in the Covid-19 isolation camp, Fahmi said that the best way to overcome it all is with positive thinking and not giving up.\n\nI was scared, anything could happen and I was afraid I wasn\u2019t going to come back.

Let\u2019s find out.\n\nThe phone looks pretty good on the back too, so when you\u2019re taking pictures of other people at least they\u2019ll be looking towards you. (Credit: TRP)\n\nA phone catered to selfie enthusiasts\n\nAs advertised by the company, the V21\u2019s main selling point has to be its selfie camera with tonnes of options for you to play with such as adjusting brightness all the way, to toning your cheeks.\n\nAnd apparently, having nifty software tricks is not enough for the Chinese manufacturer as the phone is also fitted with \u2013 wait for it \u2013 two built-in flashlights which the company calls Dual Selfie Spotlight located on the front of the phone.\n\nYou know, just in case you\u2019re in a really, really, dark room and thought that this might be the best time to take a selfie.\n\nCredit: TRP\n\nThe V21 can even guide you on how to take a good selfie \u2013 complete with outlines showing you how to pose and take the shot.\n\nThe back camera is pretty good too if you\u2019re under good sunlight and it has three different lenses for you to choose from.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good in the hand and it\u2019s pretty too\n\nAlthough this phone has a screen size of 6.44 inches, the phone actually feels good in the hand and isn\u2019t super huge thanks to a design that stretches the panel out to the edge of the phone.\n\nIf you\u2019re a bit conservative and want your phone to blend in the background, there\u2019s the Dusk Blue colour option, but if you want it to get everyone\u2019s attention including your own, there\u2019s also Sunset Dazzle which is a real looker.\n\nThe colours on the body of the phone shift when you look at it from different angles which might entice some folks who want their phone to have a slightly funkier colour palette rather than having it just plain old black or white.\n\nCredit: TRP\n\nAll day phone\n\nThe Vivo V21 has quite a slim profile but don\u2019t think that it\u2019s not beefed up in the battery department because the phone can last you a full day even if you\u2019re consuming a lot of content.\n\nThere\u2019s also the option of fast charging if you manage to drain that big battery and they\u2019re not messing about. It\u2019s actually possible to get this thing from 0 to roughly above 50% within half an hour.\n\nCredit: TRP\n\nNot really a gaming phone\n\nThe phone might tick many boxes but gaming is not one of them.\n\nYes, you can play graphic intensive games like COD Mobile or PUBG Mobile, but I noticed that the V21 doesn\u2019t allow you to max out the settings, which might be a dealbreaker for some but if you\u2019re playing casual games, it will work just fine.\n\nShould you get the V21?\n\nIt\u2019s a great phone if you\u2019re someone who likes to take a lot of selfies as this where the phone truly shines. Literally.\n\nThere are not many phones that can say that they have one, let alone two flashes for the front camera and the amount of options is great for those who want to tweak their selfies.\n\nApart from the front camera, the V21 is also capable in other areas such as having a great screen for watching stuff like YouTube or Netflix, a pretty design, and also a large battery with the option of fast charging that borders on ridiculous.\n\nThe Vivo V21 is an affordable package and that not only looks good, but it feels good to use too.\n\nCredit: TRP\n\nShare your thoughts with us via TRP\u2019s Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.", "keyword": ["really", "youre", "camera", "phone", "good", "v21", "pretty", "taking", "having", "selfies", "vivo", "selfie", "review", "option"], "summary": "Vivo recently came out with the V21, a phone that takes aim at those who like to take a lot of selfies.\nBut, is a selfie camera really enough to entice you to get this phone?\nThe phone looks pretty good on the back too, so when you\u2019re taking pictures of other people at least they\u2019ll be looking towards you.\nYou know, just in case you\u2019re in a really, really, dark room and thought that this might be the best time to take a selfie.\nIt\u2019s a great phone if you\u2019re someone who likes to take a lot of selfies as this where the phone truly shines.", "news": "The Rakyat Post", "date": "2021-06-02 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "We need to prepare for the worst, says health DG", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wNS8yNS93ZS1uZWVkLXRvLXByZXBhcmUtZm9yLXRoZS13b3JzdC1zYXlzLWhlYWx0aC1kZy_SAQA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/noor-hisham-abdullah-fmt-080521-2.jpg", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: Health director-general Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah urged the public to prepare for the worst in facing the Covid-19 wave following an exponential trend indicated by the Covid-19 graph in this country.\n\n\u201cThe rise in cases started from April 1 and could trigger a vertical surge.

assured the people of Kapit, Song, Bukit Mabong, and Belaga districts that there are sufficient supplies of essential food items throughout this Gawai Dayak season.\n\nThe ministry\u2019s Kapit chief Al-Redzamani Abdul Razak said 10 items have been listed under the Festive Season Maximum Price Control Scheme (SHMMP) for Gawai until June 3.\n\nThey are live chicken, standard chicken (slaughtered and cleaned with legs, heads, liver and giblets or any part thereof), super chicken (slaughtered and cleaned, without legs, head, liver and giblets), Grade A chicken eggs (weighing between 65g and 69.9g), Grade B chicken eggs (weighing between 60g and 64.9g each), Grade C chicken eggs (weighing between 55g and 59.9g each), live old chicken, chicken wings, pork (belly), and pork (meat and fat).\n\n\u201cBased on our regular inspection and also the feedback from both retailers and suppliers, the supply level is stable and should be sufficient to meet the demands.\n\n\u201cNonetheless, our KPDNHEP teams continue to closely supervise and monitor the selling and buying trends during the current Movement Control Order (MCO) period, as well as to ensure every trader comply strictly with the price-control scheme for Gawai 2021.\n\n\u201cWe aim to advocate a healthy business environment and a win-win situation between the traders and the consumers,\u201d Al Redzamani said in a statement.\n\nHe also warned stern action would await any trader caught raising the price of any of the controlled items during the SHMMP Gawai 2021 period.\n\n\u201cAny consumer who finds any trader not abiding by the scheme, or notices other unscrupulous trading practices, can lodge a report by calling our hotline 1-800-886-800, or send WhatsApp texts via 019-2794317.\n\n\u201cAlso, seek KPDNHEP on Facebook, or go to Kapit KPDNHEP Office behind Meligai Hotel, which is open from 8am to 5pm on every regular working day,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, a survey here yesterday showed many shoppers stocking up not only for the Gawai Dayak celebration, but also for the the statewide MCO, which takes effect today.\n\nThe Terasang Market, Pasar Tani Kapit, Kapit Night Street Market, cold storage, and various supermarkets were crowded with more customers than usual.\n\nA local resident, who wish to be identified only as \u2018Madam Chen\u2019, said her husband reminded her to buy extra vegetables and meat for their family\u2019s consumption over the next few days.\n\n\u201cI bought various green vegetables, some pork, and also fish \u2013- these should last us for the next few days.\n\n\u201cWe, the adults, do not mind much, but the children are the ones who need more food to grow,\u201d the housewife from Jalan Selirik said when met at Terasang Market yesterday.\n\nPenghulu Allan Tubam said he had spent most of his time at his longhouse throughout the various stages of MCO.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t come down to Kapit town, unless there\u2019s some urgent or official duties that have to be attended to.\n\n\u201cI believe in looking after myself and my family as much as possible. I want to protect them from Covid-19. As a community leader, I need to set a good example for my followers,\u201d he said, adding that he and other community leaders had come to get their Covid-19 vaccination.\n\n\u201cThis morning (yesterday), I took the opportunity to buy some extra food, some drinks before returning to my longhouse.\n\n\u201cWith the MCO taking effect on May 29, I wouldn\u2019t do any Gawai shopping.

Earlier today, we were told that Perodua\u2019s Sentral facility in Section 19, Petaling Jaya remained closed, including its after-sales department. According to a source, the company is expected to make an announcement on the matter soon.\n\nLikewise, Edaran Tan Chong Motor (ETCM) announced yesterday via a FB post that all Nissan workshops are temporarily closed, pending application for operation. The company has not yet updated the status of its after-sales activities as of this point.\n\nMeanwhile, Honda dealerships that have obtained approval for after-sales service to continue have begun doing so. However, we were told by a source that not all Honda service centres are operational at this point, although more dealerships are attempting to get approval to operate their SCs. Honda Malaysia had previously announced that it would continue offering after-sales services during the lockdown period.\n\nThis is also the case with workshops and parts businesses, as approval by authorities is needed to open for business. Relevant documents are also necessary to ensure staff meet the necessary travel protocols. With enforcement being reportedly strict, many businesses allowed to operate during the FMCO are choosing to remain closed until they can obtain the necessary approval letters.\n\nEarlier, domestic trade and consumer affairs (KPDNHEP) minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi had stated that service centres as well as vehicle repair (body and paint) facilities would be allowed to operate during the lockdown, at 60% worker capacity. All businesses will have to comply with tight standard operating procedures (SOPs) and all local authority directives.\n\nCar sales have of course stopped during the two-week period, as well as that for vehicle inspections and registrations, as both Puspakom and the road transport department (JPJ) have announced that no business will be done during the lockdown.

According to the statement released by the ministry yesterday, customers can only stay in retail stores or shopping malls for a maximum duration of two hours once the new directive is put in place tomorrow.\n\nSo, who will be responsible for monitoring this time limit? Based on another document that was released earlier today, the responsibility falls on the retail store and shopping mall operators themselves.

A brutal new wave of the Covid-19 epidemic killed a record high 1,290 people last month.\n\nPPK Malaysia\u2019s circular stated that a total of RM30 per person will be charged as administration fee (RM15 per dose) and another RM20 per person for logistic expenditure (RM10 per dose). The RM30 fee for two doses is supposedly paid to ProtectHealth Corporation, a company owned by the Ministry of Health (MOH) that manages private medical practitioners who sign up as vaccinators under PICK.\n\nCodeBlue contacted PPK Malaysia \u2014 which represents major shopping centres in the Klang Valley and other states \u2014 to verify the authenticity of the circular.

We pay private medical practitioners RM14 per dose administered,\u201d Khairul Faizi from the corporate communications unit of ProtectHealth Corp told CodeBlue today.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t supply vaccines as our role is managing the private medical practitioners.

ProtectHealth Corporation \u2013 a Ministry of Health (MOH) owned company whose board includes the Health director-general and MOH secretary-general \u2013 and the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) \u2013 which appears to oversee the so-called \u201ceconomic frontliners vaccination programme\u201d for the retail sector \u2013 have denied collecting payments for the vaccine rollouts by shopping centres.\n\nSo, what are shopping centres collecting the money for? If ProtectHealth is already covering the cost of vaccine administration by paying vaccinators RM14 per dose administered, is the RM50 fee to cover the cost of venue rental for setting up vaccination centres (PPVs) at malls? Even then, this seems excessive.\n\nPharmaniaga Bhd, on the other hand, is expected to immediately deliver Sinovac\u2019s coronavirus vaccines to state governments and the private sector, despite Vaccine Minister Khairy Jamaluddin\u2019s previous assertion that the federal government\u2019s order of 12 million doses must be fulfilled in its entirety \u2013 estimated end July \u2013 before Pharmaniaga begins work on other orders.\n\nWith Health Minister Dr Adham Baba and Senior Defence Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob\u2019s latest statement yesterday (Pharmaniaga is controlled by the Armed Forces Fund Board) on Pharmaniaga\u2019s vaccine distribution to states and companies running parallel with PICK, it is unclear if Pharmaniaga can fully deliver the federal government\u2019s order by the end-July target.\n\nWhy is CITF diverting Covid-19 vaccines away from PICK when we have inoculated just a fraction of the 9.4 million targeted individuals who face the highest risk of developing severe disease or dying from Covid-19 \u2013 the elderly, people with comorbidities, and the disabled community?\n\nAs of May 31, just about two million people have received at least one dose of the vaccine. Assuming that about a million of these individuals are frontline workers from the first phase of PICK and young adults who signed up for the AstraZeneca-Oxford jab (numbers are likely higher), that means Malaysia has vaccinated only a million high-risk individuals, or 11 per cent of the 9.4 million targeted.\n\nCITF has yet to publish statistics on the number of high-risk people who have received Covid-19 vaccines so far.\n\nIn the month of May alone, 1,290 people lost their lives to Covid-19 in Malaysia, nearly triple the 471 fatalities recorded in the whole of last year. Although an increasing number of younger adults are dying from Covid-19 in the new wave of the Malaysian epidemic, the elderly remain the primary victims.\n\nAbout 74 per cent of 1,290 people who died from Covid-19 last month, or 955 individuals, were aged 60 years and above. Nearly nine in 10 victims had underlying health conditions, 75 per cent of whom were aged 60 or older.\n\nDozens of people have been dying from Covid-19 every day in Malaysia in the past three weeks. When hospitals and intensive care units (ICUs) are full, our vaccination strategy should focus on reducing the number of people with Covid-19 requiring hospital or critical care, not to cut infections.\n\nPeople who receive vaccination can still contract Covid-19 and possibly infect others, but all approved coronavirus vaccines prevent severe disease and death.\n\nChasing illusory single-digit daily infections \u2013 or even triple-digit infections at this point \u2013 is an impossible endeavour that will take at least six months or even a year, depending on how fast we can inoculate two-thirds of our adult population. As of yesterday, only about 8 per cent of Malaysia\u2019s adult population has received at least one dose.\n\nIf CITF is now changing its vaccination strategy to focus on working adults to prevent further economically devastating lockdowns, then CITF should make this clear. In a scenario with limited resources \u2013 vaccine supply, manpower to run PPVs, and outreach efforts \u2013 there must be priority groups in whichever strategy, whether it\u2019s to protect the most vulnerable or to keep the economy going.\n\nThe UK recorded zero new Covid-19 deaths yesterday for the first time since July 2020. This achievement came after the UK took about six months to vaccinate nearly 75 per cent of the adult population, or over 39 million people, with at least one vaccine dose.\n\nThe UK\u2019s coronavirus vaccination programme, which opened up in phases according to age, hit its target of offering a first jab to all those in top priority groups \u2013 those aged 50 or older as well as people in high-risk categories \u2013 before April 15.\n\nEngland and Scotland have now started offering first vaccines to people aged 30 and above, while Northern Ireland and Wales have begun vaccinating over-18s. Due to the emergence of the variant first discovered in India, renamed the \u201cDelta\u201d variant, England is accelerating second vaccine doses to adults aged 50 and above.\n\nThe UK has the benefit of most residents, including non-nationals, being registered with its NHS, making it easy to reach out to senior citizens for Covid-19 vaccination. Malaysia, on the other hand, has serious challenges in providing vaccine access to the elderly, many of whom live in the community with their families or on their own instead of care homes.\n\nThe over 62,000 no-shows at Covid-19 vaccination appointments in Kedah, Pahang, Kelantan, Perak, Negeri Sembilan, Melaka, Perlis, and Terengganu \u2013 attributed to lack of transport to PPVs and not checking the MySejahtera app for appointment dates \u2013 illustrate the immense difficulty in reaching the elderly population.\n\nBut this does not mean the government should abandon senior citizens and switch focus to easier targets.

Covid-19 vaccinations onsite at shopping malls for participating retail tenants is not profiteering, the Malaysia Shopping Malls Association (PPK Malaysia) said today.\n\nInstead, the association representing shopping malls claimed that the actual estimated cost for logistics and the health personnel needed to administer the Covid-19 vaccines could go up to RM100 and even RM150, and that the malls had actually decided to subsidise the cost with plans to only collect RM50.\n\nPPK Malaysia was speaking of the plans to have onsite Covid-19 vaccination at shopping malls for employees of retail outlets in the malls, through a \u201cpublic-private sector partnership\u201d model.\n\nWhile confirming that the Covid-19 vaccines will be provided by the Malaysian government for free under this partnership PPK Malaysia said shopping malls will be paying for the fees for doctors, nurses and medical officers to Health Ministry-owned ProtectHealth Corporation and all other antecedent costs.\n\nEarlier this week, notices had circulated on social media of purported plans by shopping malls to offer Covid-19 vaccination to retail tenants\u2019 staff at RM50 per person for two doses (with some giving a breakdown of RM15 for administration per dose and RM10 for logistics per dose).\n\nPPK Malaysia said the planned collection of RM50 was meant partly to secure commitment by retail staff to ensure that they would show up for the vaccination, as well as to pay for the services of administering the Covid-19 vaccine to be provided by the private healthcare providers coordinated by ProtectHealth Corporation.\n\n\u201cOur Association members estimated that the cost of providing the venue, logistics, manpower, standby ambulance service etc for the on-site vaccination centre will amount to RM100 to RM150 per pax, depending on volume and total number of doses available each day, the total population to be vaccinated and the duration to complete all the doses.\n\n\u201cIn the interests of the national agenda, it was decided that the malls shall largely subsidise these costs and be allowed to charge merely RM10 x 2 doses = RM20 per pax to partially defray their expenses and as a commitment by the registrant so as to mitigate absenteeism, leading to wastage of vaccines which would otherwise could be administered to those yet to be scheduled and in order to reach herd immunity of the community in the shortest possible time.\n\n\u201cWe were also informed that the doctors and nurses providing their service will be allocated by the Protect Health Corporation who will charge to administer per dose at RM15.\n\n\u201cTherefore, at RM15 per dose x 2 doses equalling RM30, plus the above nominal sum of RM20 to partially defray logistic expenses, a total of RM50 for 2 doses will be charged to participants, principally only our shopping frontliners,\u201d the shopping malls association explained in a statement today.\n\nCovid-19 vaccination urgently needed, speed is key\n\nIn the same statement, PPK Malaysia said it appreciates shopping malls for recognising the need to subsidise the Covid-19 vaccination costs for retail frontliners, in order to protect the retail industry through immunisation and as an overall corporate social responsibility (CSR) contribution towards the national agenda of urgently achieving herd immunity.\n\n\u201cIt has been proven in several overseas countries that the speed of vaccinations is the way to bring down the rate of infections, coupled with self-discipline and strict adherence to SOPs instead of prolonging the need for further MCOs,\u201d it said, referring to the movement control orders (MCO) in the country.\n\nNoting that the Covid-19 vaccination for the public is being planned on a different schedule, the association said the primary purpose for the partnership with the government was to vaccinate all employees of shopping malls and malls\u2019 business outlets, adding that it is believed that the malls would be \u201cmuch safer places for the public to shop with confidence and with peace of mind\u201d once such vaccination is carried out.\n\n\u201cDespite our good intentions, we are distraught with the negative comments in the media that malls are profiteering from this exercise which is extremely far from the truth,\u201d it said, adding that this statement was issued in order to correct and put the record straight.\n\nIt noted that the \u201curgent need for access to vaccination\u201d was reflected in the shopping malls\u2019 \u201centhusiastic participation\u201d and the \u201coverwhelming registration\u201d by mall employees and mall tenants for the proposed onsite Covid-19 vaccination at malls.\n\n\u201cWe truly look forward to the success of this win-win collaboration with the authorities towards the national objective of achieving herd immunity urgently and the ultimate recovery of the economy in due course,\u201d the association said.\n\nEarlier in the statement, PPK Malaysia explained the reasoning for the idea of vaccinating mall tenants\u2019 staff onsite at shopping malls, while also providing updates on the progress of this plan.\n\nCiting the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi\u2019s May 28 announcement of plans to vaccinate an estimated 500,000 employees in the retail industry under the country\u2019s economic frontliners (retail sector) Covid-19 immunisation programme, PPK Malaysia said it lauded the government\u2019s targeting of the relevant economic sectors to speed up the Covid-19 vaccination programme.\n\n\u201cShopping malls together with all retail tenants\u2019 staff are effectively frontliners and we feel that it is imperative for the vaccination exercise to be implemented expeditiously. When vaccinated, our frontliners will not only protect themselves but more importantly, duly protect the shoppers and the public.\n\n\u201cWe are also appreciative that our proposal for on-site vaccination centres at shopping malls is adopted as it is more efficient and logical to bring the medical personnel to come on-site to administer the vaccinations instead of all the staff having to take time off work to travel to outside vaccination centres, thus interrupting business and daily operations,\u201d PPK Malaysia said.\n\nIn the May 28 statement by the KPDNHEP minister, he too had spoken of his ministry\u2019s cooperation with the Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) for the vaccination of \u201ceconomic frontliners\u201d in the retail sector expected to start in June, and had also spoke on discussions involving CITF on the same day with 60 representatives from the retail industry.\n\nThe minister had also on May 28 spoken of his ministry\u2019s cooperation with PPK Malaysia, the Malaysia Retailers Association (MRA), and Malaysia Retail Chain Association (MRCA) to establish Covid-19 vaccination centres (PPVs) at strategic locations nationwide, while also urging all retail companies to join this vaccination programme to help achieve the government\u2019s target of vaccinating 80 per cent of the population before the year ends.\n\nToday, PPK Malaysia said such an initiative in collaboration with the authorities has received \u201centhusiastic response\u201d from its members malls and retailers, noting that more than 50 malls have already notified their interest to host PPVs nationwide.\n\n\u201cDetails of this programme and the confirmed locations are being finalised and will be announced, once approved in due course, and we do look forward to the rollout by end of June 2021 onwards as scheduled,\u201d it said, having noted that it had already had several meetings with the authorities on this public-private sector partnership for Covid-19 vaccination.\n\nAbout ProtectHealth Corporation\n\nOn its website, ProtectHealth Corporation Sdn Bhd states that the not-for-profit company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Health Ministry\u2019s ProtectHealth Malaysia. It further states that it was appointed by the ministry to implement the participation of private medical practitioners in the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme.\n\nBased on information on ProtectHealth\u2019s website, private general practitioners do not need to pay to participate in the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme, but would have to receive training and also prepare their own personal protective equipment.\n\nThe website also states that ProtectHealth would pay general practitioners RM14 for their administration of each dose of Covid-19 vaccines through clinic and community outreach models, while payment of RM45 per hour would be paid to them for Covid-19 vaccination under government-organised mass vaccination models.\n\nProtectHealth Corporation denied collecting payments from shopping centres purportedly rolling out Covid-19 inoculation drives with vaccinators from ProtectHealth Corp.\n\n\u201cProtectHealth involvement remains the same for all vaccination centres. We pay private medical practitioners RM14 per dose administered,\u201d Khairul Faizi from the corporate communications unit of ProtectHealth Corp told CodeBlue today.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t supply vaccines as our role is managing the private medical practitioners. The vaccine supply is done by the government, similar to other vaccination centres.\u201d\n\nHealth news portal CodeBlue yesterday reported ProtectHealth Corporation as stating its role as merely managing the private medical practitioners carrying out Covid-19 vaccination work and that it pays RM14 per dose administered to such private healthcare personnel.\n\nCodeBlue yesterday also reported ProtectHealth Corporation as denying collecting payments from shopping malls for Covid-19 vaccination in collaboration with the company. \u2013 MalayMail", "keyword": ["shopping", "fee",

a landmark decision, the Intellectual Property High Court in Kuala Lumpur has declared that the sale, offer for sale, distribution and/or supply of TV Boxes or illicit streaming devices (ISDs) that can provide unauthorised access to copyrighted works, constitutes copyright infringement under the Copyright Act 1987.\n\nThe action in the Intellectual Property High Court was brought by satellite operator Measat Broadcast Networks, the service provider for Malaysian pay-TV platform Astro, against a seller of ISDs preloaded with applications which act as gateways to websites or content servers streaming pirated content.\n\nThe historic judgment, considered to be the first by the Intellectual Property High Court, is positively received by the authorities and industry players in their battle against digital piracy. Industry leaders including Astro laud the High Court\u2019s judgement as a bold step in the right direction against piracy in Malaysia.\n\n\u201cThe declaration by the High Court that sale of ISD which allows access to unauthorised copyright content amounts to copyright infringement sets a precedent for future civil claims on copyright infringement against ISD sellers in the market, including those on e-commerce platforms,\u201d stated Laila Saat, Director, Regulatory of Astro. \u201cThis ground-breaking declaration will strengthen intellectual property protection in the country and ongoing anti-piracy efforts, which are pivotal to ensure continuous investment and job creation in Malaysia\u2019s media and entertainment industry. We will continue to work with authorities and content partners to send a strong message that content piracy is theft, illegal and punishable by law.\u201d\n\n\u201cMCMC welcomes the court\u2019s decision, this will strengthen the legal aspects in protecting copyright infringement and battle against piracy, especially in digital and networked forms,\u201d added Zulkarnain Mohd Yasin, Chief Regulatory Officer of the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC).\n\n\u201cAcknowledging that more proactive action is needed to fight digital piracy in the country, FINAS expresses full support for legal action taken by Astro against ISD sellers and all digital piracy activities as these illegal activities has caused the local creative industry a huge loss in revenue every year,\u201d commented Dr. Ahmad Idham Ahmad Nadzri, CEO of the National Film Development Corporation Malaysia (FINAS). \u201cIn driving more holistic and effective strategy battling digital piracy, FINAS has established the Digital Piracy Eradication Committee with the collective support and involvement of relevant law enforcement agencies to further empower and strengthen enforcement, regulations and the terms of distribution licences in line with the provisions under the FINAS Act 244 1981\u201d.\n\n\u201cMyIPO looks forward for cases concerning ISDs to be brought forward to the Malaysian court,\u201d said Zulkarnain Muhammad, Deputy Director General of the Intellectual Property Corporation of Malaysia (MyIPO). \u201cPrevalent and widespread use of ISDs cause far more economic harm than physical copyright piracy. These devices are part of a wider network of online copyright piracy, which will in the long run disincentive original creators from producing creative work. Copyright piracy in any form should be curbed and deterred.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision is the correct one and we welcome it whole-heartedly,\u201d declared Louis Boswell, CEO of the Asia Video Industry Association (AVIA). \u201cContent is not made for free, and it is the right of creators and distributors to charge for it. To circumvent this and steal it is theft, and I see little difference between the theft of physical goods and the theft of video streams. As a society we need to do more to recognise theft for what it is and this ruling is a strong step in that direction.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is an important and welcome declaration by the Intellectual Property High Court, and sends a clear message that the sale of ISDs that provide unauthorised access to copyrighted works constitutes copyright infringement,\u201d asserted Kevin Plumb, Premier League Director of Legal Services. \u201cThe Premier League is committed to pursuing all those involved with providing illegal access to Premier League content as well as working to raise awareness of the risks fans face when watching via unauthorised sources. We will continue to work with Astro and local authorities as part of our ongoing anti-piracy programme in Malaysia.\u201d\n\nThe estimated loss to the industry and Malaysian economy due to piracy is over RM3 billion (\u20ac590m) annually with RM500 million in taxes and thousands of jobs at risk.\n\nThe declaration by the High Court follows recent criminal cases successfully brought against ISD retailers. On February 8th, a company director of an IT company was charged at the Shah Alam Sessions Court under Section 41 (1) (ha) of the Copyright Act 1987 with promoting Long TV Android boxes which allow the bypassing of technological protection measures on copyright broadcast work. On February 16th, a woman director of a mobile accessory company pleaded guilty to a charge of possessing TV media boxes that contains software to illegally stream Astro\u2019s content via the Internet. She was fined RM30,000 under Section 232(2) of the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998, making her the first ISD seller to be charged under this provision.\n\nThe Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) reiterated that it will take stern action against suppliers and sellers who misuse devices and software to illegally access content protected by their copyright work

Court in Luak, Miri on last Friday as blatant abuse of power and inhumane by the police.\n\nAccording to Aidi, a team from the Miri district police station was sent to the premises at around 9.30am after they received a public tip-off that the stalls there were serving dine-in breakfast to customers.\n\n\u201cAt the premises, the team witnessed that one of the stall operator was in the midst of preparing dine-in dishes for her customers,\u201d said Aidi.\n\nThe team also reported that upon realising the presence of the police, a few of the customers quickly left the premises and a worker quickly cleared-up the table.\n\nAidi said the premises had violated the current SOP of \u2018no dining-in\u2019 as the tables and chairs appeared to have been arranged for dine-in purposes.\n\n\u201cInside the premises, a man was sitting alone at a table and ignored the presence of the police. He also refused to cooperate with the team when questioned,\u201d said Aidi, adding that police had no choice but to issue him a compound.\n\nHe said it was only after the issuance of compound that the man claimed that he was a stall operator and voiced out his dissatisfaction for being issued with a compound.\n\nAidi said the stall operator, who was eating at a table in the premises, had indirectly encouraged other customers to dine-in at the premises.\n\n\u201cFurther checks on the stall operator revealed that he only has a business licence and not a licence from the Miri City Council,\u201d Aidi added.\n\nTherefore, he said what Ling had claimed in his statement was utterly wrong as evidence could be found from the premises\u2019 closed-circuit television (CCTV).\n\n\u201cFrom this, there was no blatant abuse of power and inhumane act by the police as claimed by Ling,\u201d Aidi added.\n\nThe owner of the premise is also urged to handover a copy of the CCTV footage to the police for further investigation under the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Act 1988.\n\nMeanwhile, Aidi said the police are working together with the government in the fight to break the infection chain of the Covid-19 virus in Sarawak.\n\n\u201cThe infection rate of the virus in Sarawak is worrying and everyone is urged to abide to the SOP as set by the Malaysian National Security Council,\u201d he added.", "keyword": ["aidi", "dinein", "senator", "team", "claim", "sop", "abuse", "stall", "miri", "statement", "operator", "act", "premises", "denies", "power", "lings", "chief"], "summary": "\u201cAt the premises, the team witnessed that one of the stall operator was in the midst of preparing dine-in dishes for her customers,\u201d said Aidi.\nHe said it was only after the issuance of compound that the man claimed that he was a stall operator and voiced out his dissatisfaction for being issued with a compound.\nAidi said the stall operator, who was eating at a table in the premises, had indirectly encouraged other customers to dine-in at the premises.\n\u201cFurther checks on the stall operator revealed that he only has a business licence and not a licence from the Miri City Council,\u201d Aidi added.\n\u201cFrom this, there was no blatant abuse of power and inhumane act by the police as claimed by Ling,\u201d Aidi added.", "news": "The Borneo Post", "date": "2021-05-23 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Lead example, Lo tells politicians in curbing Covid-19 pandemic", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWJvcm5lb3Bvc3QuY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvMjIvbGVhZC1leGFtcGxlLWxvLXRlbGxzLXBvbGl0aWNpYW5zLWluLWN1cmJpbmctY292aWQtMTktcGFuZGVtaWMv0gEA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2019/04/Andrew-Lo.jpeg", "text": "KUCHING (May 22): The Malaysian Trade Union Congress (MTUC) Sarawak has demanded for leadership by example in efforts to flatten the Covid-19 pandemic curve in the country.\n\nIts secretary Andrew Lo said until and unless the national and state political leaders step up and demonstrate leadership by example, Malaysia, including Sarawak, will not see an end to the Covid-19 pandemic any time soon.\n\nHe said MTUC Sarawak was quite amused by the Prime Minister\u2019s announcement that the National Security Council will tighten enforcement of the Movement Control Order (MCO) 3.0.\n\nThe Prime Minister, he noted, had inadvertently admitted that there had been loose enforcement the past 15 months.\n\n\u201cMTUC certainly does not condone any non-compliance of the standard operating procedures (SOP) and MCO.\n\n\u201cHowever we must question the many cases of Ministers and very important peoples (VIPs) that appears not to follow these restrictions and got off with a slap of the wrist, at most.\n\n\u201cWe even have Minister that was out of the country for weeks.

Could it be that PBS, just like Warisan, had also rejected Kitingan\u2019s overtures to officially join PN?\u201d he said in a statement today.\n\nKitingan, who heads STAR, a PN component party, had earlier today said he was open to the idea of opposition party Warisan joining the ruling coalition.\n\nThe Keningau MP said STAR was open to the idea and believed everybody should be invited into PN, including Warisan.\n\n\u201cThey have assemblymen who want to serve their constituencies. So, why not do this together?\n\n\u201cGRS is open (to the idea) and we have discussed it actually. Even the chief minister is open to it,\u201d Kitingan said.\n\nAlthough Warisan has rejected Kitingan\u2019s offer, the party has not, however, addressed the invitation initially made by PBS president Maximus Ongkili to join PN.\n\nOngkili had yesterday clarified remarks he made that he was willing to work with any opposition party, including Warisan.\n\nOngkili said his actual intention was to express PBS\u2019 openness to have Warisan cooperate with the state and federal governments to achieve their common development goals for the good of Sabah and Sabahans.\n\nIn his statement today, Siambun said Kitingan should realise that Warisan president Shafie Apdal\u2019s reply on his preference to work with PBS was merely a response to a question by a journalist on whether there had been any discussion with other parties on a potential partnership.\n\n\u201cShafie\u2019s preference to work with PBS was because it shares similar struggles for Sabahans as Warisan and that Ongkili is a long-time personal friend of Shafie and a consistent advocate on Sabah\u2019s rights as well.\n\n\u201cPBS is also a state-based party that had been consistent throughout these years since its formation and had been a victim of party-hopping,\u201d he said, referring to the fall of the PBS government after the state elections in 1994.\n\nSiambun also pointed out that the unique position held by PBS in the government allows it to determine the course and direction of the party without being dictated by others.\n\n\u201cPBS is not an official component member of Barisan Nasional or PN but only supports the government of the day. The support we give is contingent upon ensuring the Malaysia Agreement 1963 is wholly implemented.\n\n\u201cThis could be the reason why Ongkili was given the task to helm the Sabah and Sarawak affairs ministry in the Prime Minister\u2019s Department,\u201d he said.\n\nSiambun also said Warisan did not wish to be associated with PAS that had rejected a bill to amend Article 1(2) of the Federal Constitution.\n\nThe bill was intended to reinstate Sabah and Sarawak to their original status prior to a 1976 constitutional amendment.\n\nHe said Kitingan, whose STAR party is a formal member of PN, also worked closely with PAS, which had outrightly rejected the bill initiated by the late Liew Vui Keong, the former de facto law minister.\n\nHe said Kitingan should clarify why he is willing to work with PAS which has a nominated assemblyman in the Sabah state assembly now.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["open", "laughs", "party", "work", "warisan", "state", "pbs", "pn", "join", "invitation", "kitingan", "rejected", "jeffreys"], "summary": "KOTA KINABALU: State opposition party Warisan has declined an invitation by Perikatan Nasional deputy chairman Jeffrey Kitingan to join the ruling coalition, saying the invite was \u201chumorous\u201d.\nCould it be that PBS, just like Warisan, had also rejected Kitingan\u2019s overtures to officially join PN?\u201d he said in a statement today.\nKitingan, who heads STAR, a PN component party, had earlier today said he was open to the idea of opposition party Warisan joining the ruling coalition.\nThe Keningau MP said STAR was open to the idea and believed everybody should be invited into PN, including Warisan.\nAlthough Warisan has rejected Kitingan\u2019s offer, the party has not, however, addressed the invitation initially made by PBS president Maximus Ongkili to join PN.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-05-21 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "AirAsia\u2019s digital businesses to become Asean\u2019s leading super app", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWFsYXlzaWFucmVzZXJ2ZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNS8yOC9haXJhc2lhcy1kaWdpdGFsLWJ1c2luZXNzZXMtdG8tYmVjb21lLWFzZWFucy1sZWFkaW5nLXN1cGVyLWFwcC_SAW5odHRwczovL3RoZW1hbGF5c2lhbnJlc2VydmUuY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvMjgvYWlyYXNpYXMtZGlnaXRhbC1idXNpbmVzc2VzLXRvLWJlY29tZS1hc2VhbnMtbGVhZGluZy1zdXBlci1hcHAvYW1wLw?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://themalaysianreserve.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/AIRASIA-APP.jpg", "text": "By AZALEA AZUAR / Pic credit: airasia.com\n\nAirAsia Group Bhd\u2019s non-airline digital businesses is on the right track to becoming Asean\u2019s digital travel and lifestyle platform as it meets strong consumer demands.\n\nIts super app is now considered one of the region\u2019s top three online travel agencies (OTA) while AirAsia\u2019s e-wallet BigPay is set to become the first virtual bank and its delivery service Teleport is strengthening.\n\nDuring the group\u2019s first quarter of 2021 (1Q21) financial performance announcement on May 27, AirAsia super app posted a 45% year-on-year (YoY) increase in its revenue to RM10 million supported by solid growth of products and services available on the platform.\n\nTeleport\u2019s revenue has also tripled compared to its 1Q20 performance.\n\nAccording to AirAsia Group CEO Tan Sri Tony Fernandes, just as they revolutionised air travel 20 years ago with their low-cost carrier, AirAsia is now disrupting and democratising the lifestyle industry again through the development of their super app with over 17 travel and products leveraging off one another.\n\n\u201cIn just over a year we are now one of the top three leading online travel agencies (OTAs) in Asean based on website traffic, with over 100 million average page views monthly on airasia.com.\n\n\u201cIn the future, when travel resumes in our key markets, we can guarantee best value prices for our flight and hotel packages because we own our own airline,\u201d he explained in a press release today.\n\nExpansion of its popular products and services to its Asean markets for its super app is in AirAsia\u2019s pipeline.\n\n\u201cWe are working on expanding our health services in Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines, while offering SNAP hotel and accommodation deals in Vietnam and Singapore in the near future,\u201d said Fernandes.\n\nHe also said that Teleport not only provides the usual deliveries but has now been delivering vaccines all over Malaysia and the Asean region. Hence, it has created more than 4,000 delivery driver jobs in 17 key markets.\n\n\u201cWe are also looking forward to converting passenger planes into freighters in the coming months to cater for unprecedented cargo demand,\u201d he said.\n\nFernandes added that the group has plans to improve its BigPay e-wallet to become the best virtual bank in Asean.\n\n\u201cWe are tapping into the full potential of our loyalty platform BIG Rewards, to provide the best range for rewards and redemption in Asean and beyond.\n\n\u201cThrough our digital ecosystem, we have already created thousands of jobs and supported more than 3,500 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Malaysia.\n\n\u201cOur training centre, AirAsia Academy (currently known as Redbeat Academy), offers affordable digital and tech training courses to equip not only our own employees, but also SMEs and members of the public, with skills to bridge the technology gap in Malaysia and beyond in this ever changing digital world,\u201d he said.\n\nApart from AirAsia\u2019s digital services, its other non-airline businesses such as AirAsia Food, AirAsia Fresh, AirAsia Shop and its Santan franchise restaurants are also penetrating into new markets.\n\n\u201cAs we continue to expand our digital footprint in Malaysia and other Asean countries, our contribution in the region will only increase and become more significant from here onwards.\n\n\u201cWe saw the crisis as an opportunity to use the downtime in flying caused by the pandemic to leverage the strength of our database of over 60 million customers and to focus on developing new non airline revenue streams in the key areas of e-commerce, fintech and logistics,\u201d Fernandes commented.\n\nAirAsia has more innovations to roll out such as the ride-hailing \u201cAirAsia Ride\u201d, which will be launched in the coming months, as well as the potential of drone delivery.\n\nThe group is also planning for electric or hydronic aeroplanes to meet consumer\u2019s sustainability needs.\n\n\u201cIn the airline business, Asia Digital Engineering (ADE) is set to become one of the region\u2019s best value aircraft maintenance and overhaul providers for both short term line maintenance and longer-term base maintenance, a space previously dominated by Singapore-based maintenance and overhaul companies (MROs).\n\n\u201cI firmly believe ADE will become the leading aircraft maintenance/overhaul company in the region in the near future with significant potential growth opportunities in Asean and beyond with service excellence and the lowest cost base,\u201d he said.\n\nAirAsia is also working to launch more contactless technologies to make flying a seamless and hygienic experience when it resumes.\n\nThis includes a digital passport called Scan2Fly where passengers can upload required medical documentation and have it verified in real time online, before heading to the airport.\n\nThe group would also be introducing FACES, its biometric facial recognition technology at Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2 (KLIA 2) and it will be rolled out across all key destinations.\n\n\u201cThere is a silver lining to every crisis and the best thing to come out of this pandemic is our recovery as a stronger, more resilient travel and lifestyle platform \u2013 not solely reliant on airfares alone anymore,\u201d said Fernandes.\n\nThe \u201cnew look\u201d AirAsia would be embarking on an exciting new phase of growth, with the right focus and foundations to better meet the needs of the digital revolution.\n\nFernandes stressed that they would remain true to their promise of delivering high quality service serving the underserved by making it affordable to fly, stay, shop, eat and upskill.\n\n\u201cLooking out for the everyday people is what we do best and we aim to continue to support them, not only in the major cities, but also in the smaller cities we serve, where many people are struggling the most and access to products and services are more limited.\u201d", "keyword": ["asean", "maintenance", "aseans", "travel", "services", "super", "app", "airasias", "airasia",

open and detailed revelation of an intrusion by China\u2019s air force has raised many questions that the government needs to answer, says an expert in defence and diplomacy matters.\n\n\u201cThe biggest question is how the government, in particular Wisma Putra, is going to resolve it?\u201d asked the expert, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nThe expert said, however, that the RMAF\u2019s \u201cextremely rare\u201d move to reveal details of the incident which saw its fighter jets being scrambled to intercept 16 People\u2019s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) planes in Malaysia\u2019s maritime zone (ZMM), provided a \u201cgolden opportunity\u201d for the country.\n\nThe source said while the possibility that the PLAAF was carrying out surveillance in the area could not be ruled out, the Chinese could also have been \u201ctesting the waters\u201d over Malaysia\u2019s air defence systems and its reaction.\n\nThe \u201cbreach of Malaysian airspace and sovereignty\u201d \u2013 as foreign affairs minister Hishammuddin Hussein termed it \u2013 by the Chinese aircraft is the latest in a series of actions by China in the disputed South China Sea that has its neighbours worried.\n\nFor years, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei, Taiwan and Vietnam have been contesting China\u2019s claim to almost all of the South China Sea. These countries have often protested against China over what they claimed were intrusions into their territories.\n\nIn recent years, the dispute over the sea has seen a rise in tensions not only between China and these nations but also between China and the US. As recent as May 20, China and the US exchanged strong words over US naval activity in the region.\n\nThe expert asked what the rules of engagement would have been had the Chinese planes not turned back when the RMAF scrambled its jets.\n\n\u201cTypically, when an air force is confronted with such a situation, they would fire a warning shot or resort to aggressive manoeuvres to \u2018force\u2019 the foreign planes to turn back. Were our Hawks armed for engagement? How many Hawks were deployed?\n\n\u201cMy question is why did we scramble our Hawk 208 fighters? Those are advanced trainer jets, light fighter jets. They do not have the same interception capabilities of our Sukhoi Su-30MKM or F/A-18 Hornets.\n\n\u201cAre they airworthy? Or were the Hawks deployed because they are closest to that part of the South China Sea? If so, why are we not stationing more advanced fighters closer to the region?\u201d\n\nHe commended Hishammuddin for saying Wisma Putra would summon the Chinese ambassador to explain the incident.\n\nThe Chinese, the expert said, had already said the flight by the 16 planes was routine training and that it had not entered any other country\u2019s territorial air space under international law.\n\n\u201cEssentially, the Chinese are saying they have done nothing wrong. But Wisma Putra wants an explanation on the breach of Malaysian airspace and sovereignty.\n\n\u201cSo who is telling the truth? And what happens next? Will China apologise? I doubt they will, given their stance on the South China Sea.\u201d\n\nThe expert said if Wisma Putra was not satisfied with China\u2019s explanation and if the country refused to apologise, Malaysia should take the \u201cbold\u201d step of expelling the Chinese ambassador and recalling the Malaysian ambassador in China.\n\n\u201cIn diplomatic lexicon, expelling an ambassador is a very serious statement. I think if we do not do so, we (Malaysia) run the risk of looking weak.\u201d\n\nStill, the expert said, the incident provided Malaysia with the \u201cgolden opportunity\u201d to analyse and address defence issues, including the placement of frontline fighter jets and pattern of violations by foreign forces, particularly in the hotly disputed South China Sea.\n\nMeanwhile, defence analyst Lam Choong Wah said Asean and China were currently negotiating a code of conduct (CoC) for the South China Sea and that these negotiations needed to be sped up to regulate the behaviour of military operations in the region.\n\n\u201cMalaysia should utilise all available diplomatic channels to handle the issue to preserve national interests,\u201d Lam said.\n\n\u201cBeing firm or soft is not the crux of the problem. The core issue is there is no CoC in place to regulate military behavior in disputed areas, and until there is a CoC, military or maritime enforcement standoffs will take place from time to time.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["expert", "force", "wisma", "planes", "south", "malaysian", "chinese", "jets", "chinas", "intrusion", "putrajaya", "resolve", "sea", "putra"], "summary": "\u201cThe biggest question is how the government, in particular Wisma Putra, is going to resolve it?\u201d asked the expert, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.\nFor years, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei, Taiwan and Vietnam have been contesting China\u2019s claim to almost all of the South China Sea.\nThe expert asked what the rules of engagement would have been had the Chinese planes not turned back when the RMAF scrambled its jets.\n\u201cTypically, when an air force is confronted with such a situation, they would fire a warning shot or resort to aggressive manoeuvres to \u2018force\u2019 the foreign planes to turn back.\nBut Wisma Putra wants an explanation on the breach of Malaysian airspace and sovereignty.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-06-03 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Take more from KWAN to help M40, B40 groups, says Najib", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wNi8wMi90YWtlLW1vcmUtZnJvbS1rd2FuLXRvLWhlbHAtbTQwLWI0MC1ncm91cHMtc2F5cy1uYWppYi_SAQA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Fmt Reporters"], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/02-PANIC-BUYING-MC0-3.0.jpg", "text": "PETALING JAYA: Former prime minister Najib Razak has urged the government to take another RM4.2 billion from the National Trust Fund (KWAN) to assist the (bottom 40) B40 and (middle 40) M40 groups during the total lockdown.\n\nIn a Facebook post, he assured that Barisan Nasional would replenish the funds in the future.\n\nNajib also questioned if the current allocation of RM100 each for single Malaysians and RM500 for each B40 household with at least three children was sufficient.\n\n\u201cOn top of that, this assistance comes after they have faced MCO 2.0 and MCO 3.0/3.1 for five months, and now the total lockdown,\u201d he said.\n\nNajib noted that the payments would only come in by the end of June, while the additional RM500 for the Prihatin Special Grant (GKP) recipients was due in July.\n\nHe added that GKP recipients should also be eligible for Bantuan Prihatin Rakyat, as they had the additional burden of bearing the losses faced by their businesses.\n\nNajib said the Perikatan Nasional administration could dip into KWAN again if it wished to avoid borrowing more money, since it had already borrowed over RM100 billion for BPR aid within the first five months of the year.\n\nWith the additional funds from KWAN, Najib said, more could be handed out under the Bantuan Prihatin aid scheme.\n\n\u201cThe RM300 to RM500 will become RM900 to RM1,500 for B40 families.

It\u2019s sad at first, but whatever happened, happened and it\u2019s best to move on and be strong,\u201d said the 33-year-old content creator from Selangor, when we spoke on Sunday (30 May).\n\nFahmi had been confirmed positive with Covid-19 after getting tested at the Covid Assessment Centre (CAC) in Stadium Melawati, Shah Alam on 21 May. That same day, he was sent straight to the PKRC to undergo more than a week of mandatory quarantine.\n\n\u201cI have three days to go. They count it from the day you first did your swab test and 10 days after that.\u201d he explained, mentioning how all of his close contacts were fortunate enough to have not contracted the virus.\n\nSharing his experiences, Fahmi revealed how his body had reacted over the course of his infection.\n\nMy symptoms came in pretty late, each day one symptom. First came the sore throat, fever the day after, then I started to lose my sense of smell and taste, then I started to feel heavy breathing and panting. But nothing serious. That\u2019s why they sent me to MAEPS because here they have the equipment to scan my lungs.\n\nFahmi also said that the medical staff stationed at the PKRC had been very reliable and responsive to his needs and everyone else who\u2019s there.\n\nQuarantine life\n\nWith thousands of other Covid-19 patients confined together at the \u2018DG Hall\u2019 in MAEPS, Fahmi noted his shock when first arriving at the PKRC and said that quarantine life took some getting used to.\n\n\u201cI was of course surprised by the insane number of people here, to the point that there are not enough beds. People have to sleep on mattresses on the floor,\u201d he said, adding that without any appropriate shower facility there, patients also have to contend with long bathroom lines and having to bathe on the toilet.\n\nHowever, despite the minor discomforts, Fahmi said everything at the PKRC had been satisfactory and personally relates life in quarantine to what people might find in boarding schools.\n\n\u201cFood is served three times a day. Breakfast is at 8 am, lunch at 12 noon and dinner at 6 pm.

The key to surviving here is to just make friends to keep yourself sane.\n\nWith the time spent living with a deadly disease and after having been in the Covid-19 isolation camp, Fahmi said that the best way to overcome it all is with positive thinking and not giving up.\n\nI was scared, anything could happen and I was afraid I wasn\u2019t going to come back.

Let\u2019s find out.\n\nThe phone looks pretty good on the back too, so when you\u2019re taking pictures of other people at least they\u2019ll be looking towards you. (Credit: TRP)\n\nA phone catered to selfie enthusiasts\n\nAs advertised by the company, the V21\u2019s main selling point has to be its selfie camera with tonnes of options for you to play with such as adjusting brightness all the way, to toning your cheeks.\n\nAnd apparently, having nifty software tricks is not enough for the Chinese manufacturer as the phone is also fitted with \u2013 wait for it \u2013 two built-in flashlights which the company calls Dual Selfie Spotlight located on the front of the phone.\n\nYou know, just in case you\u2019re in a really, really, dark room and thought that this might be the best time to take a selfie.\n\nCredit: TRP\n\nThe V21 can even guide you on how to take a good selfie \u2013 complete with outlines showing you how to pose and take the shot.\n\nThe back camera is pretty good too if you\u2019re under good sunlight and it has three different lenses for you to choose from.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good in the hand and it\u2019s pretty too\n\nAlthough this phone has a screen size of 6.44 inches, the phone actually feels good in the hand and isn\u2019t super huge thanks to a design that stretches the panel out to the edge of the phone.\n\nIf you\u2019re a bit conservative and want your phone to blend in the background, there\u2019s the Dusk Blue colour option, but if you want it to get everyone\u2019s attention including your own, there\u2019s also Sunset Dazzle which is a real looker.\n\nThe colours on the body of the phone shift when you look at it from different angles which might entice some folks who want their phone to have a slightly funkier colour palette rather than having it just plain old black or white.\n\nCredit: TRP\n\nAll day phone\n\nThe Vivo V21 has quite a slim profile but don\u2019t think that it\u2019s not beefed up in the battery department because the phone can last you a full day even if you\u2019re consuming a lot of content.\n\nThere\u2019s also the option of fast charging if you manage to drain that big battery and they\u2019re not messing about. It\u2019s actually possible to get this thing from 0 to roughly above 50% within half an hour.\n\nCredit: TRP\n\nNot really a gaming phone\n\nThe phone might tick many boxes but gaming is not one of them.\n\nYes, you can play graphic intensive games like COD Mobile or PUBG Mobile, but I noticed that the V21 doesn\u2019t allow you to max out the settings, which might be a dealbreaker for some but if you\u2019re playing casual games, it will work just fine.\n\nShould you get the V21?\n\nIt\u2019s a great phone if you\u2019re someone who likes to take a lot of selfies as this where the phone truly shines. Literally.\n\nThere are not many phones that can say that they have one, let alone two flashes for the front camera and the amount of options is great for those who want to tweak their selfies.\n\nApart from the front camera, the V21 is also capable in other areas such as having a great screen for watching stuff like YouTube or Netflix, a pretty design, and also a large battery with the option of fast charging that borders on ridiculous.\n\nThe Vivo V21 is an affordable package and that not only looks good, but it feels good to use too.\n\nCredit: TRP\n\nShare your thoughts with us via TRP\u2019s Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.", "keyword": ["really", "youre", "camera", "phone", "good", "v21", "pretty", "taking", "having", "selfies", "vivo", "selfie", "review", "option"], "summary": "Vivo recently came out with the V21, a phone that takes aim at those who like to take a lot of selfies.\nBut, is a selfie camera really enough to entice you to get this phone?\nThe phone looks pretty good on the back too, so when you\u2019re taking pictures of other people at least they\u2019ll be looking towards you.\nYou know, just in case you\u2019re in a really, really, dark room and thought that this might be the best time to take a selfie.\nIt\u2019s a great phone if you\u2019re someone who likes to take a lot of selfies as this where the phone truly shines.", "news": "The Rakyat Post", "date": "2021-06-02 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "We need to prepare for the worst, says health DG", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wNS8yNS93ZS1uZWVkLXRvLXByZXBhcmUtZm9yLXRoZS13b3JzdC1zYXlzLWhlYWx0aC1kZy_SAQA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/noor-hisham-abdullah-fmt-080521-2.jpg", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: Health director-general Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah urged the public to prepare for the worst in facing the Covid-19 wave following an exponential trend indicated by the Covid-19 graph in this country.\n\n\u201cThe rise in cases started from April 1 and could trigger a vertical surge.

assured the people of Kapit, Song, Bukit Mabong, and Belaga districts that there are sufficient supplies of essential food items throughout this Gawai Dayak season.\n\nThe ministry\u2019s Kapit chief Al-Redzamani Abdul Razak said 10 items have been listed under the Festive Season Maximum Price Control Scheme (SHMMP) for Gawai until June 3.\n\nThey are live chicken, standard chicken (slaughtered and cleaned with legs, heads, liver and giblets or any part thereof), super chicken (slaughtered and cleaned, without legs, head, liver and giblets), Grade A chicken eggs (weighing between 65g and 69.9g), Grade B chicken eggs (weighing between 60g and 64.9g each), Grade C chicken eggs (weighing between 55g and 59.9g each), live old chicken, chicken wings, pork (belly), and pork (meat and fat).\n\n\u201cBased on our regular inspection and also the feedback from both retailers and suppliers, the supply level is stable and should be sufficient to meet the demands.\n\n\u201cNonetheless, our KPDNHEP teams continue to closely supervise and monitor the selling and buying trends during the current Movement Control Order (MCO) period, as well as to ensure every trader comply strictly with the price-control scheme for Gawai 2021.\n\n\u201cWe aim to advocate a healthy business environment and a win-win situation between the traders and the consumers,\u201d Al Redzamani said in a statement.\n\nHe also warned stern action would await any trader caught raising the price of any of the controlled items during the SHMMP Gawai 2021 period.\n\n\u201cAny consumer who finds any trader not abiding by the scheme, or notices other unscrupulous trading practices, can lodge a report by calling our hotline 1-800-886-800, or send WhatsApp texts via 019-2794317.\n\n\u201cAlso, seek KPDNHEP on Facebook, or go to Kapit KPDNHEP Office behind Meligai Hotel, which is open from 8am to 5pm on every regular working day,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, a survey here yesterday showed many shoppers stocking up not only for the Gawai Dayak celebration, but also for the the statewide MCO, which takes effect today.\n\nThe Terasang Market, Pasar Tani Kapit, Kapit Night Street Market, cold storage, and various supermarkets were crowded with more customers than usual.\n\nA local resident, who wish to be identified only as \u2018Madam Chen\u2019, said her husband reminded her to buy extra vegetables and meat for their family\u2019s consumption over the next few days.\n\n\u201cI bought various green vegetables, some pork, and also fish \u2013- these should last us for the next few days.\n\n\u201cWe, the adults, do not mind much, but the children are the ones who need more food to grow,\u201d the housewife from Jalan Selirik said when met at Terasang Market yesterday.\n\nPenghulu Allan Tubam said he had spent most of his time at his longhouse throughout the various stages of MCO.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t come down to Kapit town, unless there\u2019s some urgent or official duties that have to be attended to.\n\n\u201cI believe in looking after myself and my family as much as possible. I want to protect them from Covid-19. As a community leader, I need to set a good example for my followers,\u201d he said, adding that he and other community leaders had come to get their Covid-19 vaccination.\n\n\u201cThis morning (yesterday), I took the opportunity to buy some extra food, some drinks before returning to my longhouse.\n\n\u201cWith the MCO taking effect on May 29, I wouldn\u2019t do any Gawai shopping.

Earlier today, we were told that Perodua\u2019s Sentral facility in Section 19, Petaling Jaya remained closed, including its after-sales department. According to a source, the company is expected to make an announcement on the matter soon.\n\nLikewise, Edaran Tan Chong Motor (ETCM) announced yesterday via a FB post that all Nissan workshops are temporarily closed, pending application for operation. The company has not yet updated the status of its after-sales activities as of this point.\n\nMeanwhile, Honda dealerships that have obtained approval for after-sales service to continue have begun doing so. However, we were told by a source that not all Honda service centres are operational at this point, although more dealerships are attempting to get approval to operate their SCs. Honda Malaysia had previously announced that it would continue offering after-sales services during the lockdown period.\n\nThis is also the case with workshops and parts businesses, as approval by authorities is needed to open for business. Relevant documents are also necessary to ensure staff meet the necessary travel protocols. With enforcement being reportedly strict, many businesses allowed to operate during the FMCO are choosing to remain closed until they can obtain the necessary approval letters.\n\nEarlier, domestic trade and consumer affairs (KPDNHEP) minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi had stated that service centres as well as vehicle repair (body and paint) facilities would be allowed to operate during the lockdown, at 60% worker capacity. All businesses will have to comply with tight standard operating procedures (SOPs) and all local authority directives.\n\nCar sales have of course stopped during the two-week period, as well as that for vehicle inspections and registrations, as both Puspakom and the road transport department (JPJ) have announced that no business will be done during the lockdown.

According to the statement released by the ministry yesterday, customers can only stay in retail stores or shopping malls for a maximum duration of two hours once the new directive is put in place tomorrow.\n\nSo, who will be responsible for monitoring this time limit? Based on another document that was released earlier today, the responsibility falls on the retail store and shopping mall operators themselves.

A brutal new wave of the Covid-19 epidemic killed a record high 1,290 people last month.\n\nPPK Malaysia\u2019s circular stated that a total of RM30 per person will be charged as administration fee (RM15 per dose) and another RM20 per person for logistic expenditure (RM10 per dose). The RM30 fee for two doses is supposedly paid to ProtectHealth Corporation, a company owned by the Ministry of Health (MOH) that manages private medical practitioners who sign up as vaccinators under PICK.\n\nCodeBlue contacted PPK Malaysia \u2014 which represents major shopping centres in the Klang Valley and other states \u2014 to verify the authenticity of the circular.

We pay private medical practitioners RM14 per dose administered,\u201d Khairul Faizi from the corporate communications unit of ProtectHealth Corp told CodeBlue today.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t supply vaccines as our role is managing the private medical practitioners.

ProtectHealth Corporation \u2013 a Ministry of Health (MOH) owned company whose board includes the Health director-general and MOH secretary-general \u2013 and the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) \u2013 which appears to oversee the so-called \u201ceconomic frontliners vaccination programme\u201d for the retail sector \u2013 have denied collecting payments for the vaccine rollouts by shopping centres.\n\nSo, what are shopping centres collecting the money for? If ProtectHealth is already covering the cost of vaccine administration by paying vaccinators RM14 per dose administered, is the RM50 fee to cover the cost of venue rental for setting up vaccination centres (PPVs) at malls? Even then, this seems excessive.\n\nPharmaniaga Bhd, on the other hand, is expected to immediately deliver Sinovac\u2019s coronavirus vaccines to state governments and the private sector, despite Vaccine Minister Khairy Jamaluddin\u2019s previous assertion that the federal government\u2019s order of 12 million doses must be fulfilled in its entirety \u2013 estimated end July \u2013 before Pharmaniaga begins work on other orders.\n\nWith Health Minister Dr Adham Baba and Senior Defence Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob\u2019s latest statement yesterday (Pharmaniaga is controlled by the Armed Forces Fund Board) on Pharmaniaga\u2019s vaccine distribution to states and companies running parallel with PICK, it is unclear if Pharmaniaga can fully deliver the federal government\u2019s order by the end-July target.\n\nWhy is CITF diverting Covid-19 vaccines away from PICK when we have inoculated just a fraction of the 9.4 million targeted individuals who face the highest risk of developing severe disease or dying from Covid-19 \u2013 the elderly, people with comorbidities, and the disabled community?\n\nAs of May 31, just about two million people have received at least one dose of the vaccine. Assuming that about a million of these individuals are frontline workers from the first phase of PICK and young adults who signed up for the AstraZeneca-Oxford jab (numbers are likely higher), that means Malaysia has vaccinated only a million high-risk individuals, or 11 per cent of the 9.4 million targeted.\n\nCITF has yet to publish statistics on the number of high-risk people who have received Covid-19 vaccines so far.\n\nIn the month of May alone, 1,290 people lost their lives to Covid-19 in Malaysia, nearly triple the 471 fatalities recorded in the whole of last year. Although an increasing number of younger adults are dying from Covid-19 in the new wave of the Malaysian epidemic, the elderly remain the primary victims.\n\nAbout 74 per cent of 1,290 people who died from Covid-19 last month, or 955 individuals, were aged 60 years and above. Nearly nine in 10 victims had underlying health conditions, 75 per cent of whom were aged 60 or older.\n\nDozens of people have been dying from Covid-19 every day in Malaysia in the past three weeks. When hospitals and intensive care units (ICUs) are full, our vaccination strategy should focus on reducing the number of people with Covid-19 requiring hospital or critical care, not to cut infections.\n\nPeople who receive vaccination can still contract Covid-19 and possibly infect others, but all approved coronavirus vaccines prevent severe disease and death.\n\nChasing illusory single-digit daily infections \u2013 or even triple-digit infections at this point \u2013 is an impossible endeavour that will take at least six months or even a year, depending on how fast we can inoculate two-thirds of our adult population. As of yesterday, only about 8 per cent of Malaysia\u2019s adult population has received at least one dose.\n\nIf CITF is now changing its vaccination strategy to focus on working adults to prevent further economically devastating lockdowns, then CITF should make this clear. In a scenario with limited resources \u2013 vaccine supply, manpower to run PPVs, and outreach efforts \u2013 there must be priority groups in whichever strategy, whether it\u2019s to protect the most vulnerable or to keep the economy going.\n\nThe UK recorded zero new Covid-19 deaths yesterday for the first time since July 2020. This achievement came after the UK took about six months to vaccinate nearly 75 per cent of the adult population, or over 39 million people, with at least one vaccine dose.\n\nThe UK\u2019s coronavirus vaccination programme, which opened up in phases according to age, hit its target of offering a first jab to all those in top priority groups \u2013 those aged 50 or older as well as people in high-risk categories \u2013 before April 15.\n\nEngland and Scotland have now started offering first vaccines to people aged 30 and above, while Northern Ireland and Wales have begun vaccinating over-18s. Due to the emergence of the variant first discovered in India, renamed the \u201cDelta\u201d variant, England is accelerating second vaccine doses to adults aged 50 and above.\n\nThe UK has the benefit of most residents, including non-nationals, being registered with its NHS, making it easy to reach out to senior citizens for Covid-19 vaccination. Malaysia, on the other hand, has serious challenges in providing vaccine access to the elderly, many of whom live in the community with their families or on their own instead of care homes.\n\nThe over 62,000 no-shows at Covid-19 vaccination appointments in Kedah, Pahang, Kelantan, Perak, Negeri Sembilan, Melaka, Perlis, and Terengganu \u2013 attributed to lack of transport to PPVs and not checking the MySejahtera app for appointment dates \u2013 illustrate the immense difficulty in reaching the elderly population.\n\nBut this does not mean the government should abandon senior citizens and switch focus to easier targets.

Covid-19 vaccinations onsite at shopping malls for participating retail tenants is not profiteering, the Malaysia Shopping Malls Association (PPK Malaysia) said today.\n\nInstead, the association representing shopping malls claimed that the actual estimated cost for logistics and the health personnel needed to administer the Covid-19 vaccines could go up to RM100 and even RM150, and that the malls had actually decided to subsidise the cost with plans to only collect RM50.\n\nPPK Malaysia was speaking of the plans to have onsite Covid-19 vaccination at shopping malls for employees of retail outlets in the malls, through a \u201cpublic-private sector partnership\u201d model.\n\nWhile confirming that the Covid-19 vaccines will be provided by the Malaysian government for free under this partnership PPK Malaysia said shopping malls will be paying for the fees for doctors, nurses and medical officers to Health Ministry-owned ProtectHealth Corporation and all other antecedent costs.\n\nEarlier this week, notices had circulated on social media of purported plans by shopping malls to offer Covid-19 vaccination to retail tenants\u2019 staff at RM50 per person for two doses (with some giving a breakdown of RM15 for administration per dose and RM10 for logistics per dose).\n\nPPK Malaysia said the planned collection of RM50 was meant partly to secure commitment by retail staff to ensure that they would show up for the vaccination, as well as to pay for the services of administering the Covid-19 vaccine to be provided by the private healthcare providers coordinated by ProtectHealth Corporation.\n\n\u201cOur Association members estimated that the cost of providing the venue, logistics, manpower, standby ambulance service etc for the on-site vaccination centre will amount to RM100 to RM150 per pax, depending on volume and total number of doses available each day, the total population to be vaccinated and the duration to complete all the doses.\n\n\u201cIn the interests of the national agenda, it was decided that the malls shall largely subsidise these costs and be allowed to charge merely RM10 x 2 doses = RM20 per pax to partially defray their expenses and as a commitment by the registrant so as to mitigate absenteeism, leading to wastage of vaccines which would otherwise could be administered to those yet to be scheduled and in order to reach herd immunity of the community in the shortest possible time.\n\n\u201cWe were also informed that the doctors and nurses providing their service will be allocated by the Protect Health Corporation who will charge to administer per dose at RM15.\n\n\u201cTherefore, at RM15 per dose x 2 doses equalling RM30, plus the above nominal sum of RM20 to partially defray logistic expenses, a total of RM50 for 2 doses will be charged to participants, principally only our shopping frontliners,\u201d the shopping malls association explained in a statement today.\n\nCovid-19 vaccination urgently needed, speed is key\n\nIn the same statement, PPK Malaysia said it appreciates shopping malls for recognising the need to subsidise the Covid-19 vaccination costs for retail frontliners, in order to protect the retail industry through immunisation and as an overall corporate social responsibility (CSR) contribution towards the national agenda of urgently achieving herd immunity.\n\n\u201cIt has been proven in several overseas countries that the speed of vaccinations is the way to bring down the rate of infections, coupled with self-discipline and strict adherence to SOPs instead of prolonging the need for further MCOs,\u201d it said, referring to the movement control orders (MCO) in the country.\n\nNoting that the Covid-19 vaccination for the public is being planned on a different schedule, the association said the primary purpose for the partnership with the government was to vaccinate all employees of shopping malls and malls\u2019 business outlets, adding that it is believed that the malls would be \u201cmuch safer places for the public to shop with confidence and with peace of mind\u201d once such vaccination is carried out.\n\n\u201cDespite our good intentions, we are distraught with the negative comments in the media that malls are profiteering from this exercise which is extremely far from the truth,\u201d it said, adding that this statement was issued in order to correct and put the record straight.\n\nIt noted that the \u201curgent need for access to vaccination\u201d was reflected in the shopping malls\u2019 \u201centhusiastic participation\u201d and the \u201coverwhelming registration\u201d by mall employees and mall tenants for the proposed onsite Covid-19 vaccination at malls.\n\n\u201cWe truly look forward to the success of this win-win collaboration with the authorities towards the national objective of achieving herd immunity urgently and the ultimate recovery of the economy in due course,\u201d the association said.\n\nEarlier in the statement, PPK Malaysia explained the reasoning for the idea of vaccinating mall tenants\u2019 staff onsite at shopping malls, while also providing updates on the progress of this plan.\n\nCiting the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi\u2019s May 28 announcement of plans to vaccinate an estimated 500,000 employees in the retail industry under the country\u2019s economic frontliners (retail sector) Covid-19 immunisation programme, PPK Malaysia said it lauded the government\u2019s targeting of the relevant economic sectors to speed up the Covid-19 vaccination programme.\n\n\u201cShopping malls together with all retail tenants\u2019 staff are effectively frontliners and we feel that it is imperative for the vaccination exercise to be implemented expeditiously. When vaccinated, our frontliners will not only protect themselves but more importantly, duly protect the shoppers and the public.\n\n\u201cWe are also appreciative that our proposal for on-site vaccination centres at shopping malls is adopted as it is more efficient and logical to bring the medical personnel to come on-site to administer the vaccinations instead of all the staff having to take time off work to travel to outside vaccination centres, thus interrupting business and daily operations,\u201d PPK Malaysia said.\n\nIn the May 28 statement by the KPDNHEP minister, he too had spoken of his ministry\u2019s cooperation with the Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) for the vaccination of \u201ceconomic frontliners\u201d in the retail sector expected to start in June, and had also spoke on discussions involving CITF on the same day with 60 representatives from the retail industry.\n\nThe minister had also on May 28 spoken of his ministry\u2019s cooperation with PPK Malaysia, the Malaysia Retailers Association (MRA), and Malaysia Retail Chain Association (MRCA) to establish Covid-19 vaccination centres (PPVs) at strategic locations nationwide, while also urging all retail companies to join this vaccination programme to help achieve the government\u2019s target of vaccinating 80 per cent of the population before the year ends.\n\nToday, PPK Malaysia said such an initiative in collaboration with the authorities has received \u201centhusiastic response\u201d from its members malls and retailers, noting that more than 50 malls have already notified their interest to host PPVs nationwide.\n\n\u201cDetails of this programme and the confirmed locations are being finalised and will be announced, once approved in due course, and we do look forward to the rollout by end of June 2021 onwards as scheduled,\u201d it said, having noted that it had already had several meetings with the authorities on this public-private sector partnership for Covid-19 vaccination.\n\nAbout ProtectHealth Corporation\n\nOn its website, ProtectHealth Corporation Sdn Bhd states that the not-for-profit company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Health Ministry\u2019s ProtectHealth Malaysia. It further states that it was appointed by the ministry to implement the participation of private medical practitioners in the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme.\n\nBased on information on ProtectHealth\u2019s website, private general practitioners do not need to pay to participate in the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme, but would have to receive training and also prepare their own personal protective equipment.\n\nThe website also states that ProtectHealth would pay general practitioners RM14 for their administration of each dose of Covid-19 vaccines through clinic and community outreach models, while payment of RM45 per hour would be paid to them for Covid-19 vaccination under government-organised mass vaccination models.\n\nProtectHealth Corporation denied collecting payments from shopping centres purportedly rolling out Covid-19 inoculation drives with vaccinators from ProtectHealth Corp.\n\n\u201cProtectHealth involvement remains the same for all vaccination centres. We pay private medical practitioners RM14 per dose administered,\u201d Khairul Faizi from the corporate communications unit of ProtectHealth Corp told CodeBlue today.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t supply vaccines as our role is managing the private medical practitioners. The vaccine supply is done by the government, similar to other vaccination centres.\u201d\n\nHealth news portal CodeBlue yesterday reported ProtectHealth Corporation as stating its role as merely managing the private medical practitioners carrying out Covid-19 vaccination work and that it pays RM14 per dose administered to such private healthcare personnel.\n\nCodeBlue yesterday also reported ProtectHealth Corporation as denying collecting payments from shopping malls for Covid-19 vaccination in collaboration with the company. \u2013 MalayMail", "keyword": ["shopping", "fee",

a landmark decision, the Intellectual Property High Court in Kuala Lumpur has declared that the sale, offer for sale, distribution and/or supply of TV Boxes or illicit streaming devices (ISDs) that can provide unauthorised access to copyrighted works, constitutes copyright infringement under the Copyright Act 1987.\n\nThe action in the Intellectual Property High Court was brought by satellite operator Measat Broadcast Networks, the service provider for Malaysian pay-TV platform Astro, against a seller of ISDs preloaded with applications which act as gateways to websites or content servers streaming pirated content.\n\nThe historic judgment, considered to be the first by the Intellectual Property High Court, is positively received by the authorities and industry players in their battle against digital piracy. Industry leaders including Astro laud the High Court\u2019s judgement as a bold step in the right direction against piracy in Malaysia.\n\n\u201cThe declaration by the High Court that sale of ISD which allows access to unauthorised copyright content amounts to copyright infringement sets a precedent for future civil claims on copyright infringement against ISD sellers in the market, including those on e-commerce platforms,\u201d stated Laila Saat, Director, Regulatory of Astro. \u201cThis ground-breaking declaration will strengthen intellectual property protection in the country and ongoing anti-piracy efforts, which are pivotal to ensure continuous investment and job creation in Malaysia\u2019s media and entertainment industry. We will continue to work with authorities and content partners to send a strong message that content piracy is theft, illegal and punishable by law.\u201d\n\n\u201cMCMC welcomes the court\u2019s decision, this will strengthen the legal aspects in protecting copyright infringement and battle against piracy, especially in digital and networked forms,\u201d added Zulkarnain Mohd Yasin, Chief Regulatory Officer of the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC).\n\n\u201cAcknowledging that more proactive action is needed to fight digital piracy in the country, FINAS expresses full support for legal action taken by Astro against ISD sellers and all digital piracy activities as these illegal activities has caused the local creative industry a huge loss in revenue every year,\u201d commented Dr. Ahmad Idham Ahmad Nadzri, CEO of the National Film Development Corporation Malaysia (FINAS). \u201cIn driving more holistic and effective strategy battling digital piracy, FINAS has established the Digital Piracy Eradication Committee with the collective support and involvement of relevant law enforcement agencies to further empower and strengthen enforcement, regulations and the terms of distribution licences in line with the provisions under the FINAS Act 244 1981\u201d.\n\n\u201cMyIPO looks forward for cases concerning ISDs to be brought forward to the Malaysian court,\u201d said Zulkarnain Muhammad, Deputy Director General of the Intellectual Property Corporation of Malaysia (MyIPO). \u201cPrevalent and widespread use of ISDs cause far more economic harm than physical copyright piracy. These devices are part of a wider network of online copyright piracy, which will in the long run disincentive original creators from producing creative work. Copyright piracy in any form should be curbed and deterred.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision is the correct one and we welcome it whole-heartedly,\u201d declared Louis Boswell, CEO of the Asia Video Industry Association (AVIA). \u201cContent is not made for free, and it is the right of creators and distributors to charge for it. To circumvent this and steal it is theft, and I see little difference between the theft of physical goods and the theft of video streams. As a society we need to do more to recognise theft for what it is and this ruling is a strong step in that direction.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is an important and welcome declaration by the Intellectual Property High Court, and sends a clear message that the sale of ISDs that provide unauthorised access to copyrighted works constitutes copyright infringement,\u201d asserted Kevin Plumb, Premier League Director of Legal Services. \u201cThe Premier League is committed to pursuing all those involved with providing illegal access to Premier League content as well as working to raise awareness of the risks fans face when watching via unauthorised sources. We will continue to work with Astro and local authorities as part of our ongoing anti-piracy programme in Malaysia.\u201d\n\nThe estimated loss to the industry and Malaysian economy due to piracy is over RM3 billion (\u20ac590m) annually with RM500 million in taxes and thousands of jobs at risk.\n\nThe declaration by the High Court follows recent criminal cases successfully brought against ISD retailers. On February 8th, a company director of an IT company was charged at the Shah Alam Sessions Court under Section 41 (1) (ha) of the Copyright Act 1987 with promoting Long TV Android boxes which allow the bypassing of technological protection measures on copyright broadcast work. On February 16th, a woman director of a mobile accessory company pleaded guilty to a charge of possessing TV media boxes that contains software to illegally stream Astro\u2019s content via the Internet. She was fined RM30,000 under Section 232(2) of the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998, making her the first ISD seller to be charged under this provision.\n\nThe Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) reiterated that it will take stern action against suppliers and sellers who misuse devices and software to illegally access content protected by their copyright work

Court in Luak, Miri on last Friday as blatant abuse of power and inhumane by the police.\n\nAccording to Aidi, a team from the Miri district police station was sent to the premises at around 9.30am after they received a public tip-off that the stalls there were serving dine-in breakfast to customers.\n\n\u201cAt the premises, the team witnessed that one of the stall operator was in the midst of preparing dine-in dishes for her customers,\u201d said Aidi.\n\nThe team also reported that upon realising the presence of the police, a few of the customers quickly left the premises and a worker quickly cleared-up the table.\n\nAidi said the premises had violated the current SOP of \u2018no dining-in\u2019 as the tables and chairs appeared to have been arranged for dine-in purposes.\n\n\u201cInside the premises, a man was sitting alone at a table and ignored the presence of the police. He also refused to cooperate with the team when questioned,\u201d said Aidi, adding that police had no choice but to issue him a compound.\n\nHe said it was only after the issuance of compound that the man claimed that he was a stall operator and voiced out his dissatisfaction for being issued with a compound.\n\nAidi said the stall operator, who was eating at a table in the premises, had indirectly encouraged other customers to dine-in at the premises.\n\n\u201cFurther checks on the stall operator revealed that he only has a business licence and not a licence from the Miri City Council,\u201d Aidi added.\n\nTherefore, he said what Ling had claimed in his statement was utterly wrong as evidence could be found from the premises\u2019 closed-circuit television (CCTV).\n\n\u201cFrom this, there was no blatant abuse of power and inhumane act by the police as claimed by Ling,\u201d Aidi added.\n\nThe owner of the premise is also urged to handover a copy of the CCTV footage to the police for further investigation under the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Act 1988.\n\nMeanwhile, Aidi said the police are working together with the government in the fight to break the infection chain of the Covid-19 virus in Sarawak.\n\n\u201cThe infection rate of the virus in Sarawak is worrying and everyone is urged to abide to the SOP as set by the Malaysian National Security Council,\u201d he added.", "keyword": ["aidi", "dinein", "senator", "team", "claim", "sop", "abuse", "stall", "miri", "statement", "operator", "act", "premises", "denies", "power", "lings", "chief"], "summary": "\u201cAt the premises, the team witnessed that one of the stall operator was in the midst of preparing dine-in dishes for her customers,\u201d said Aidi.\nHe said it was only after the issuance of compound that the man claimed that he was a stall operator and voiced out his dissatisfaction for being issued with a compound.\nAidi said the stall operator, who was eating at a table in the premises, had indirectly encouraged other customers to dine-in at the premises.\n\u201cFurther checks on the stall operator revealed that he only has a business licence and not a licence from the Miri City Council,\u201d Aidi added.\n\u201cFrom this, there was no blatant abuse of power and inhumane act by the police as claimed by Ling,\u201d Aidi added.", "news": "The Borneo Post", "date": "2021-05-23 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Lead example, Lo tells politicians in curbing Covid-19 pandemic", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWJvcm5lb3Bvc3QuY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvMjIvbGVhZC1leGFtcGxlLWxvLXRlbGxzLXBvbGl0aWNpYW5zLWluLWN1cmJpbmctY292aWQtMTktcGFuZGVtaWMv0gEA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2019/04/Andrew-Lo.jpeg", "text": "KUCHING (May 22): The Malaysian Trade Union Congress (MTUC) Sarawak has demanded for leadership by example in efforts to flatten the Covid-19 pandemic curve in the country.\n\nIts secretary Andrew Lo said until and unless the national and state political leaders step up and demonstrate leadership by example, Malaysia, including Sarawak, will not see an end to the Covid-19 pandemic any time soon.\n\nHe said MTUC Sarawak was quite amused by the Prime Minister\u2019s announcement that the National Security Council will tighten enforcement of the Movement Control Order (MCO) 3.0.\n\nThe Prime Minister, he noted, had inadvertently admitted that there had been loose enforcement the past 15 months.\n\n\u201cMTUC certainly does not condone any non-compliance of the standard operating procedures (SOP) and MCO.\n\n\u201cHowever we must question the many cases of Ministers and very important peoples (VIPs) that appears not to follow these restrictions and got off with a slap of the wrist, at most.\n\n\u201cWe even have Minister that was out of the country for weeks.

Could it be that PBS, just like Warisan, had also rejected Kitingan\u2019s overtures to officially join PN?\u201d he said in a statement today.\n\nKitingan, who heads STAR, a PN component party, had earlier today said he was open to the idea of opposition party Warisan joining the ruling coalition.\n\nThe Keningau MP said STAR was open to the idea and believed everybody should be invited into PN, including Warisan.\n\n\u201cThey have assemblymen who want to serve their constituencies. So, why not do this together?\n\n\u201cGRS is open (to the idea) and we have discussed it actually. Even the chief minister is open to it,\u201d Kitingan said.\n\nAlthough Warisan has rejected Kitingan\u2019s offer, the party has not, however, addressed the invitation initially made by PBS president Maximus Ongkili to join PN.\n\nOngkili had yesterday clarified remarks he made that he was willing to work with any opposition party, including Warisan.\n\nOngkili said his actual intention was to express PBS\u2019 openness to have Warisan cooperate with the state and federal governments to achieve their common development goals for the good of Sabah and Sabahans.\n\nIn his statement today, Siambun said Kitingan should realise that Warisan president Shafie Apdal\u2019s reply on his preference to work with PBS was merely a response to a question by a journalist on whether there had been any discussion with other parties on a potential partnership.\n\n\u201cShafie\u2019s preference to work with PBS was because it shares similar struggles for Sabahans as Warisan and that Ongkili is a long-time personal friend of Shafie and a consistent advocate on Sabah\u2019s rights as well.\n\n\u201cPBS is also a state-based party that had been consistent throughout these years since its formation and had been a victim of party-hopping,\u201d he said, referring to the fall of the PBS government after the state elections in 1994.\n\nSiambun also pointed out that the unique position held by PBS in the government allows it to determine the course and direction of the party without being dictated by others.\n\n\u201cPBS is not an official component member of Barisan Nasional or PN but only supports the government of the day. The support we give is contingent upon ensuring the Malaysia Agreement 1963 is wholly implemented.\n\n\u201cThis could be the reason why Ongkili was given the task to helm the Sabah and Sarawak affairs ministry in the Prime Minister\u2019s Department,\u201d he said.\n\nSiambun also said Warisan did not wish to be associated with PAS that had rejected a bill to amend Article 1(2) of the Federal Constitution.\n\nThe bill was intended to reinstate Sabah and Sarawak to their original status prior to a 1976 constitutional amendment.\n\nHe said Kitingan, whose STAR party is a formal member of PN, also worked closely with PAS, which had outrightly rejected the bill initiated by the late Liew Vui Keong, the former de facto law minister.\n\nHe said Kitingan should clarify why he is willing to work with PAS which has a nominated assemblyman in the Sabah state assembly now.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["open", "laughs", "party", "work", "warisan", "state", "pbs", "pn", "join", "invitation", "kitingan", "rejected", "jeffreys"], "summary": "KOTA KINABALU: State opposition party Warisan has declined an invitation by Perikatan Nasional deputy chairman Jeffrey Kitingan to join the ruling coalition, saying the invite was \u201chumorous\u201d.\nCould it be that PBS, just like Warisan, had also rejected Kitingan\u2019s overtures to officially join PN?\u201d he said in a statement today.\nKitingan, who heads STAR, a PN component party, had earlier today said he was open to the idea of opposition party Warisan joining the ruling coalition.\nThe Keningau MP said STAR was open to the idea and believed everybody should be invited into PN, including Warisan.\nAlthough Warisan has rejected Kitingan\u2019s offer, the party has not, however, addressed the invitation initially made by PBS president Maximus Ongkili to join PN.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-05-21 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "AirAsia\u2019s digital businesses to become Asean\u2019s leading super app", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWFsYXlzaWFucmVzZXJ2ZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNS8yOC9haXJhc2lhcy1kaWdpdGFsLWJ1c2luZXNzZXMtdG8tYmVjb21lLWFzZWFucy1sZWFkaW5nLXN1cGVyLWFwcC_SAW5odHRwczovL3RoZW1hbGF5c2lhbnJlc2VydmUuY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvMjgvYWlyYXNpYXMtZGlnaXRhbC1idXNpbmVzc2VzLXRvLWJlY29tZS1hc2VhbnMtbGVhZGluZy1zdXBlci1hcHAvYW1wLw?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://themalaysianreserve.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/AIRASIA-APP.jpg", "text": "By AZALEA AZUAR / Pic credit: airasia.com\n\nAirAsia Group Bhd\u2019s non-airline digital businesses is on the right track to becoming Asean\u2019s digital travel and lifestyle platform as it meets strong consumer demands.\n\nIts super app is now considered one of the region\u2019s top three online travel agencies (OTA) while AirAsia\u2019s e-wallet BigPay is set to become the first virtual bank and its delivery service Teleport is strengthening.\n\nDuring the group\u2019s first quarter of 2021 (1Q21) financial performance announcement on May 27, AirAsia super app posted a 45% year-on-year (YoY) increase in its revenue to RM10 million supported by solid growth of products and services available on the platform.\n\nTeleport\u2019s revenue has also tripled compared to its 1Q20 performance.\n\nAccording to AirAsia Group CEO Tan Sri Tony Fernandes, just as they revolutionised air travel 20 years ago with their low-cost carrier, AirAsia is now disrupting and democratising the lifestyle industry again through the development of their super app with over 17 travel and products leveraging off one another.\n\n\u201cIn just over a year we are now one of the top three leading online travel agencies (OTAs) in Asean based on website traffic, with over 100 million average page views monthly on airasia.com.\n\n\u201cIn the future, when travel resumes in our key markets, we can guarantee best value prices for our flight and hotel packages because we own our own airline,\u201d he explained in a press release today.\n\nExpansion of its popular products and services to its Asean markets for its super app is in AirAsia\u2019s pipeline.\n\n\u201cWe are working on expanding our health services in Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines, while offering SNAP hotel and accommodation deals in Vietnam and Singapore in the near future,\u201d said Fernandes.\n\nHe also said that Teleport not only provides the usual deliveries but has now been delivering vaccines all over Malaysia and the Asean region. Hence, it has created more than 4,000 delivery driver jobs in 17 key markets.\n\n\u201cWe are also looking forward to converting passenger planes into freighters in the coming months to cater for unprecedented cargo demand,\u201d he said.\n\nFernandes added that the group has plans to improve its BigPay e-wallet to become the best virtual bank in Asean.\n\n\u201cWe are tapping into the full potential of our loyalty platform BIG Rewards, to provide the best range for rewards and redemption in Asean and beyond.\n\n\u201cThrough our digital ecosystem, we have already created thousands of jobs and supported more than 3,500 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Malaysia.\n\n\u201cOur training centre, AirAsia Academy (currently known as Redbeat Academy), offers affordable digital and tech training courses to equip not only our own employees, but also SMEs and members of the public, with skills to bridge the technology gap in Malaysia and beyond in this ever changing digital world,\u201d he said.\n\nApart from AirAsia\u2019s digital services, its other non-airline businesses such as AirAsia Food, AirAsia Fresh, AirAsia Shop and its Santan franchise restaurants are also penetrating into new markets.\n\n\u201cAs we continue to expand our digital footprint in Malaysia and other Asean countries, our contribution in the region will only increase and become more significant from here onwards.\n\n\u201cWe saw the crisis as an opportunity to use the downtime in flying caused by the pandemic to leverage the strength of our database of over 60 million customers and to focus on developing new non airline revenue streams in the key areas of e-commerce, fintech and logistics,\u201d Fernandes commented.\n\nAirAsia has more innovations to roll out such as the ride-hailing \u201cAirAsia Ride\u201d, which will be launched in the coming months, as well as the potential of drone delivery.\n\nThe group is also planning for electric or hydronic aeroplanes to meet consumer\u2019s sustainability needs.\n\n\u201cIn the airline business, Asia Digital Engineering (ADE) is set to become one of the region\u2019s best value aircraft maintenance and overhaul providers for both short term line maintenance and longer-term base maintenance, a space previously dominated by Singapore-based maintenance and overhaul companies (MROs).\n\n\u201cI firmly believe ADE will become the leading aircraft maintenance/overhaul company in the region in the near future with significant potential growth opportunities in Asean and beyond with service excellence and the lowest cost base,\u201d he said.\n\nAirAsia is also working to launch more contactless technologies to make flying a seamless and hygienic experience when it resumes.\n\nThis includes a digital passport called Scan2Fly where passengers can upload required medical documentation and have it verified in real time online, before heading to the airport.\n\nThe group would also be introducing FACES, its biometric facial recognition technology at Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2 (KLIA 2) and it will be rolled out across all key destinations.\n\n\u201cThere is a silver lining to every crisis and the best thing to come out of this pandemic is our recovery as a stronger, more resilient travel and lifestyle platform \u2013 not solely reliant on airfares alone anymore,\u201d said Fernandes.\n\nThe \u201cnew look\u201d AirAsia would be embarking on an exciting new phase of growth, with the right focus and foundations to better meet the needs of the digital revolution.\n\nFernandes stressed that they would remain true to their promise of delivering high quality service serving the underserved by making it affordable to fly, stay, shop, eat and upskill.\n\n\u201cLooking out for the everyday people is what we do best and we aim to continue to support them, not only in the major cities, but also in the smaller cities we serve, where many people are struggling the most and access to products and services are more limited.\u201d", "keyword": ["asean", "maintenance", "aseans", "travel", "services", "super", "app", "airasias", "airasia",

open and detailed revelation of an intrusion by China\u2019s air force has raised many questions that the government needs to answer, says an expert in defence and diplomacy matters.\n\n\u201cThe biggest question is how the government, in particular Wisma Putra, is going to resolve it?\u201d asked the expert, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nThe expert said, however, that the RMAF\u2019s \u201cextremely rare\u201d move to reveal details of the incident which saw its fighter jets being scrambled to intercept 16 People\u2019s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) planes in Malaysia\u2019s maritime zone (ZMM), provided a \u201cgolden opportunity\u201d for the country.\n\nThe source said while the possibility that the PLAAF was carrying out surveillance in the area could not be ruled out, the Chinese could also have been \u201ctesting the waters\u201d over Malaysia\u2019s air defence systems and its reaction.\n\nThe \u201cbreach of Malaysian airspace and sovereignty\u201d \u2013 as foreign affairs minister Hishammuddin Hussein termed it \u2013 by the Chinese aircraft is the latest in a series of actions by China in the disputed South China Sea that has its neighbours worried.\n\nFor years, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei, Taiwan and Vietnam have been contesting China\u2019s claim to almost all of the South China Sea. These countries have often protested against China over what they claimed were intrusions into their territories.\n\nIn recent years, the dispute over the sea has seen a rise in tensions not only between China and these nations but also between China and the US. As recent as May 20, China and the US exchanged strong words over US naval activity in the region.\n\nThe expert asked what the rules of engagement would have been had the Chinese planes not turned back when the RMAF scrambled its jets.\n\n\u201cTypically, when an air force is confronted with such a situation, they would fire a warning shot or resort to aggressive manoeuvres to \u2018force\u2019 the foreign planes to turn back. Were our Hawks armed for engagement? How many Hawks were deployed?\n\n\u201cMy question is why did we scramble our Hawk 208 fighters? Those are advanced trainer jets, light fighter jets. They do not have the same interception capabilities of our Sukhoi Su-30MKM or F/A-18 Hornets.\n\n\u201cAre they airworthy? Or were the Hawks deployed because they are closest to that part of the South China Sea? If so, why are we not stationing more advanced fighters closer to the region?\u201d\n\nHe commended Hishammuddin for saying Wisma Putra would summon the Chinese ambassador to explain the incident.\n\nThe Chinese, the expert said, had already said the flight by the 16 planes was routine training and that it had not entered any other country\u2019s territorial air space under international law.\n\n\u201cEssentially, the Chinese are saying they have done nothing wrong. But Wisma Putra wants an explanation on the breach of Malaysian airspace and sovereignty.\n\n\u201cSo who is telling the truth? And what happens next? Will China apologise? I doubt they will, given their stance on the South China Sea.\u201d\n\nThe expert said if Wisma Putra was not satisfied with China\u2019s explanation and if the country refused to apologise, Malaysia should take the \u201cbold\u201d step of expelling the Chinese ambassador and recalling the Malaysian ambassador in China.\n\n\u201cIn diplomatic lexicon, expelling an ambassador is a very serious statement. I think if we do not do so, we (Malaysia) run the risk of looking weak.\u201d\n\nStill, the expert said, the incident provided Malaysia with the \u201cgolden opportunity\u201d to analyse and address defence issues, including the placement of frontline fighter jets and pattern of violations by foreign forces, particularly in the hotly disputed South China Sea.\n\nMeanwhile, defence analyst Lam Choong Wah said Asean and China were currently negotiating a code of conduct (CoC) for the South China Sea and that these negotiations needed to be sped up to regulate the behaviour of military operations in the region.\n\n\u201cMalaysia should utilise all available diplomatic channels to handle the issue to preserve national interests,\u201d Lam said.\n\n\u201cBeing firm or soft is not the crux of the problem. The core issue is there is no CoC in place to regulate military behavior in disputed areas, and until there is a CoC, military or maritime enforcement standoffs will take place from time to time.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["expert", "force", "wisma", "planes", "south", "malaysian", "chinese", "jets", "chinas", "intrusion", "putrajaya", "resolve", "sea", "putra"], "summary": "\u201cThe biggest question is how the government, in particular Wisma Putra, is going to resolve it?\u201d asked the expert, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.\nFor years, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei, Taiwan and Vietnam have been contesting China\u2019s claim to almost all of the South China Sea.\nThe expert asked what the rules of engagement would have been had the Chinese planes not turned back when the RMAF scrambled its jets.\n\u201cTypically, when an air force is confronted with such a situation, they would fire a warning shot or resort to aggressive manoeuvres to \u2018force\u2019 the foreign planes to turn back.\nBut Wisma Putra wants an explanation on the breach of Malaysian airspace and sovereignty.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-06-03 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Take more from KWAN to help M40, B40 groups, says Najib", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wNi8wMi90YWtlLW1vcmUtZnJvbS1rd2FuLXRvLWhlbHAtbTQwLWI0MC1ncm91cHMtc2F5cy1uYWppYi_SAQA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Fmt Reporters"], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/02-PANIC-BUYING-MC0-3.0.jpg", "text": "PETALING JAYA: Former prime minister Najib Razak has urged the government to take another RM4.2 billion from the National Trust Fund (KWAN) to assist the (bottom 40) B40 and (middle 40) M40 groups during the total lockdown.\n\nIn a Facebook post, he assured that Barisan Nasional would replenish the funds in the future.\n\nNajib also questioned if the current allocation of RM100 each for single Malaysians and RM500 for each B40 household with at least three children was sufficient.\n\n\u201cOn top of that, this assistance comes after they have faced MCO 2.0 and MCO 3.0/3.1 for five months, and now the total lockdown,\u201d he said.\n\nNajib noted that the payments would only come in by the end of June, while the additional RM500 for the Prihatin Special Grant (GKP) recipients was due in July.\n\nHe added that GKP recipients should also be eligible for Bantuan Prihatin Rakyat, as they had the additional burden of bearing the losses faced by their businesses.\n\nNajib said the Perikatan Nasional administration could dip into KWAN again if it wished to avoid borrowing more money, since it had already borrowed over RM100 billion for BPR aid within the first five months of the year.\n\nWith the additional funds from KWAN, Najib said, more could be handed out under the Bantuan Prihatin aid scheme.\n\n\u201cThe RM300 to RM500 will become RM900 to RM1,500 for B40 families.

It\u2019s sad at first, but whatever happened, happened and it\u2019s best to move on and be strong,\u201d said the 33-year-old content creator from Selangor, when we spoke on Sunday (30 May).\n\nFahmi had been confirmed positive with Covid-19 after getting tested at the Covid Assessment Centre (CAC) in Stadium Melawati, Shah Alam on 21 May. That same day, he was sent straight to the PKRC to undergo more than a week of mandatory quarantine.\n\n\u201cI have three days to go. They count it from the day you first did your swab test and 10 days after that.\u201d he explained, mentioning how all of his close contacts were fortunate enough to have not contracted the virus.\n\nSharing his experiences, Fahmi revealed how his body had reacted over the course of his infection.\n\nMy symptoms came in pretty late, each day one symptom. First came the sore throat, fever the day after, then I started to lose my sense of smell and taste, then I started to feel heavy breathing and panting. But nothing serious. That\u2019s why they sent me to MAEPS because here they have the equipment to scan my lungs.\n\nFahmi also said that the medical staff stationed at the PKRC had been very reliable and responsive to his needs and everyone else who\u2019s there.\n\nQuarantine life\n\nWith thousands of other Covid-19 patients confined together at the \u2018DG Hall\u2019 in MAEPS, Fahmi noted his shock when first arriving at the PKRC and said that quarantine life took some getting used to.\n\n\u201cI was of course surprised by the insane number of people here, to the point that there are not enough beds. People have to sleep on mattresses on the floor,\u201d he said, adding that without any appropriate shower facility there, patients also have to contend with long bathroom lines and having to bathe on the toilet.\n\nHowever, despite the minor discomforts, Fahmi said everything at the PKRC had been satisfactory and personally relates life in quarantine to what people might find in boarding schools.\n\n\u201cFood is served three times a day. Breakfast is at 8 am, lunch at 12 noon and dinner at 6 pm.

The key to surviving here is to just make friends to keep yourself sane.\n\nWith the time spent living with a deadly disease and after having been in the Covid-19 isolation camp, Fahmi said that the best way to overcome it all is with positive thinking and not giving up.\n\nI was scared, anything could happen and I was afraid I wasn\u2019t going to come back.

Let\u2019s find out.\n\nThe phone looks pretty good on the back too, so when you\u2019re taking pictures of other people at least they\u2019ll be looking towards you. (Credit: TRP)\n\nA phone catered to selfie enthusiasts\n\nAs advertised by the company, the V21\u2019s main selling point has to be its selfie camera with tonnes of options for you to play with such as adjusting brightness all the way, to toning your cheeks.\n\nAnd apparently, having nifty software tricks is not enough for the Chinese manufacturer as the phone is also fitted with \u2013 wait for it \u2013 two built-in flashlights which the company calls Dual Selfie Spotlight located on the front of the phone.\n\nYou know, just in case you\u2019re in a really, really, dark room and thought that this might be the best time to take a selfie.\n\nCredit: TRP\n\nThe V21 can even guide you on how to take a good selfie \u2013 complete with outlines showing you how to pose and take the shot.\n\nThe back camera is pretty good too if you\u2019re under good sunlight and it has three different lenses for you to choose from.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good in the hand and it\u2019s pretty too\n\nAlthough this phone has a screen size of 6.44 inches, the phone actually feels good in the hand and isn\u2019t super huge thanks to a design that stretches the panel out to the edge of the phone.\n\nIf you\u2019re a bit conservative and want your phone to blend in the background, there\u2019s the Dusk Blue colour option, but if you want it to get everyone\u2019s attention including your own, there\u2019s also Sunset Dazzle which is a real looker.\n\nThe colours on the body of the phone shift when you look at it from different angles which might entice some folks who want their phone to have a slightly funkier colour palette rather than having it just plain old black or white.\n\nCredit: TRP\n\nAll day phone\n\nThe Vivo V21 has quite a slim profile but don\u2019t think that it\u2019s not beefed up in the battery department because the phone can last you a full day even if you\u2019re consuming a lot of content.\n\nThere\u2019s also the option of fast charging if you manage to drain that big battery and they\u2019re not messing about. It\u2019s actually possible to get this thing from 0 to roughly above 50% within half an hour.\n\nCredit: TRP\n\nNot really a gaming phone\n\nThe phone might tick many boxes but gaming is not one of them.\n\nYes, you can play graphic intensive games like COD Mobile or PUBG Mobile, but I noticed that the V21 doesn\u2019t allow you to max out the settings, which might be a dealbreaker for some but if you\u2019re playing casual games, it will work just fine.\n\nShould you get the V21?\n\nIt\u2019s a great phone if you\u2019re someone who likes to take a lot of selfies as this where the phone truly shines. Literally.\n\nThere are not many phones that can say that they have one, let alone two flashes for the front camera and the amount of options is great for those who want to tweak their selfies.\n\nApart from the front camera, the V21 is also capable in other areas such as having a great screen for watching stuff like YouTube or Netflix, a pretty design, and also a large battery with the option of fast charging that borders on ridiculous.\n\nThe Vivo V21 is an affordable package and that not only looks good, but it feels good to use too.\n\nCredit: TRP\n\nShare your thoughts with us via TRP\u2019s Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.", "keyword": ["really", "youre", "camera", "phone", "good", "v21", "pretty", "taking", "having", "selfies", "vivo", "selfie", "review", "option"], "summary": "Vivo recently came out with the V21, a phone that takes aim at those who like to take a lot of selfies.\nBut, is a selfie camera really enough to entice you to get this phone?\nThe phone looks pretty good on the back too, so when you\u2019re taking pictures of other people at least they\u2019ll be looking towards you.\nYou know, just in case you\u2019re in a really, really, dark room and thought that this might be the best time to take a selfie.\nIt\u2019s a great phone if you\u2019re someone who likes to take a lot of selfies as this where the phone truly shines.", "news": "The Rakyat Post", "date": "2021-06-02 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "We need to prepare for the worst, says health DG", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wNS8yNS93ZS1uZWVkLXRvLXByZXBhcmUtZm9yLXRoZS13b3JzdC1zYXlzLWhlYWx0aC1kZy_SAQA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/noor-hisham-abdullah-fmt-080521-2.jpg", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: Health director-general Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah urged the public to prepare for the worst in facing the Covid-19 wave following an exponential trend indicated by the Covid-19 graph in this country.\n\n\u201cThe rise in cases started from April 1 and could trigger a vertical surge.

Earlier today, we were told that Perodua\u2019s Sentral facility in Section 19, Petaling Jaya remained closed, including its after-sales department. According to a source, the company is expected to make an announcement on the matter soon.\n\nLikewise, Edaran Tan Chong Motor (ETCM) announced yesterday via a FB post that all Nissan workshops are temporarily closed, pending application for operation. The company has not yet updated the status of its after-sales activities as of this point.\n\nMeanwhile, Honda dealerships that have obtained approval for after-sales service to continue have begun doing so.

All businesses will have to comply with tight standard operating procedures (SOPs) and all local authority directives.\n\nCar sales have of course stopped during the two-week period, as well as that for vehicle inspections and registrations, as both Puspakom and the road transport department (JPJ) have announced that no business will be done during the lockdown.

According to the statement released by the ministry yesterday, customers can only stay in retail stores or shopping malls for a maximum duration of two hours once the new directive is put in place tomorrow.\n\nSo, who will be responsible for monitoring this time limit? Based on another document that was released earlier today, the responsibility falls on the retail store and shopping mall operators themselves.

A brutal new wave of the Covid-19 epidemic killed a record high 1,290 people last month.\n\nPPK Malaysia\u2019s circular stated that a total of RM30 per person will be charged as administration fee (RM15 per dose) and another RM20 per person for logistic expenditure (RM10 per dose). The RM30 fee for two doses is supposedly paid to ProtectHealth Corporation, a company owned by the Ministry of Health (MOH) that manages private medical practitioners who sign up as vaccinators under PICK.\n\nCodeBlue contacted PPK Malaysia \u2014 which represents major shopping centres in the Klang Valley and other states \u2014 to verify the authenticity of the circular. A representative from PPK Malaysia said: \u201cYes, we sent the circular. We want to vaccinate the staff to make shopping malls a safer place.\u201d\n\nPPK Malaysia\u2019s circular stated that their coronavirus vaccination programme will be conducted together with the Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) under the Science, Technology and Innovation Ministry (MOSTI) and the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP).\n\n\u201cAs mentioned panel doctors and medical personnel, for example nurses registered under ProtectHealth Corporation (PHC) will administer the vaccinations and malls will need to pay RM15 per dose to PHC,\u201d PPK Malaysia president Teo Chiang Kok said in his May 29 circular to the association\u2019s members.\n\n\u201cAs each course requires two rounds of vaccination, the total cost to be paid to PHC will be RM30 per pax which we will strongly encourage malls to undertake for their own employees.\u201d\n\nHowever, ProtectHealth Corporation denied collecting payments from shopping centres purportedly rolling out Covid-19 inoculation drives with vaccinators from ProtectHealth Corp.\n\n\u201cProtectHealth involvement remains the same for all vaccination centres. We pay private medical practitioners RM14 per dose administered,\u201d Khairul Faizi from the corporate communications unit of ProtectHealth Corp told CodeBlue today.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t supply vaccines as our role is managing the private medical practitioners. The vaccine supply is done by the government, similar to other vaccination centres.\u201d\n\nKPDNHEP corporate communications unit head Yunus Tasim firmly denied collecting money from any party for the shopping centres\u2019 Covid-19 vaccination programmes.\n\n\u201cWe are finding ways to vaccinate the economic frontliners in the country who are in constant interaction with consumers,\u201d Yunus told CodeBlue.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t collect money from anyone for the vaccines. The vaccines are from the government and it is free of charge,\u201d he added.\n\nMalls like Suria KLCC, KL Gateway, Bangsar Village, Aeon, and Damansara Uptown Two have already informed tenants on their Covid-19 vaccination programmes, charging RM50 per vaccine recipient.\n\nKPDNHEP previously announced last May 28 that the \u201cEconomic Frontliners Vaccination Programme\u201d for the retail sector will begin this month, covering more than 500,000 retail workers.\n\nNonetheless, CITF has yet to announce the launch date of this inoculation programme, nor explained whether it would involve charging vaccine recipients or their employers. The source of the Covid-19 vaccine supply for retail workers or other \u201ceconomic frontliners\u201d was not mentioned by any involved stakeholders.\n\nMOSTI did not respond to CodeBlue\u2019s requests for clarification at the time of writing.\n\nVaccine Minister Khairy Jamaluddin said earlier today that the government would begin to vaccinate workers in industries and economic sectors that must remain open during the Movement Control Order (MCO).

ProtectHealth Corporation \u2013 a Ministry of Health (MOH) owned company whose board includes the Health director-general and MOH secretary-general \u2013 and the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) \u2013 which appears to oversee the so-called \u201ceconomic frontliners vaccination programme\u201d for the retail sector \u2013 have denied collecting payments for the vaccine rollouts by shopping centres.\n\nSo, what are shopping centres collecting the money for? If ProtectHealth is already covering the cost of vaccine administration by paying vaccinators RM14 per dose administered, is the RM50 fee to cover the cost of venue rental for setting up vaccination centres (PPVs) at malls? Even then, this seems excessive.\n\nPharmaniaga Bhd, on the other hand, is expected to immediately deliver Sinovac\u2019s coronavirus vaccines to state governments and the private sector, despite Vaccine Minister Khairy Jamaluddin\u2019s previous assertion that the federal government\u2019s order of 12 million doses must be fulfilled in its entirety \u2013 estimated end July \u2013 before Pharmaniaga begins work on other orders.\n\nWith Health Minister Dr Adham Baba and Senior Defence Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob\u2019s latest statement yesterday (Pharmaniaga is controlled by the Armed Forces Fund Board) on Pharmaniaga\u2019s vaccine distribution to states and companies running parallel with PICK, it is unclear if Pharmaniaga can fully deliver the federal government\u2019s order by the end-July target.\n\nWhy is CITF diverting Covid-19 vaccines away from PICK when we have inoculated just a fraction of the 9.4 million targeted individuals who face the highest risk of developing severe disease or dying from Covid-19 \u2013 the elderly, people with comorbidities, and the disabled community?\n\nAs of May 31, just about two million people have received at least one dose of the vaccine. Assuming that about a million of these individuals are frontline workers from the first phase of PICK and young adults who signed up for the AstraZeneca-Oxford jab (numbers are likely higher), that means Malaysia has vaccinated only a million high-risk individuals, or 11 per cent of the 9.4 million targeted.\n\nCITF has yet to publish statistics on the number of high-risk people who have received Covid-19 vaccines so far.\n\nIn the month of May alone, 1,290 people lost their lives to Covid-19 in Malaysia, nearly triple the 471 fatalities recorded in the whole of last year. Although an increasing number of younger adults are dying from Covid-19 in the new wave of the Malaysian epidemic, the elderly remain the primary victims.\n\nAbout 74 per cent of 1,290 people who died from Covid-19 last month, or 955 individuals, were aged 60 years and above. Nearly nine in 10 victims had underlying health conditions, 75 per cent of whom were aged 60 or older.\n\nDozens of people have been dying from Covid-19 every day in Malaysia in the past three weeks. When hospitals and intensive care units (ICUs) are full, our vaccination strategy should focus on reducing the number of people with Covid-19 requiring hospital or critical care, not to cut infections.\n\nPeople who receive vaccination can still contract Covid-19 and possibly infect others, but all approved coronavirus vaccines prevent severe disease and death.\n\nChasing illusory single-digit daily infections \u2013 or even triple-digit infections at this point \u2013 is an impossible endeavour that will take at least six months or even a year, depending on how fast we can inoculate two-thirds of our adult population. As of yesterday, only about 8 per cent of Malaysia\u2019s adult population has received at least one dose.\n\nIf CITF is now changing its vaccination strategy to focus on working adults to prevent further economically devastating lockdowns, then CITF should make this clear. In a scenario with limited resources \u2013 vaccine supply, manpower to run PPVs, and outreach efforts \u2013 there must be priority groups in whichever strategy, whether it\u2019s to protect the most vulnerable or to keep the economy going.\n\nThe UK recorded zero new Covid-19 deaths yesterday for the first time since July 2020. This achievement came after the UK took about six months to vaccinate nearly 75 per cent of the adult population, or over 39 million people, with at least one vaccine dose.\n\nThe UK\u2019s coronavirus vaccination programme, which opened up in phases according to age, hit its target of offering a first jab to all those in top priority groups \u2013 those aged 50 or older as well as people in high-risk categories \u2013 before April 15.\n\nEngland and Scotland have now started offering first vaccines to people aged 30 and above, while Northern Ireland and Wales have begun vaccinating over-18s. Due to the emergence of the variant first discovered in India, renamed the \u201cDelta\u201d variant, England is accelerating second vaccine doses to adults aged 50 and above.\n\nThe UK has the benefit of most residents, including non-nationals, being registered with its NHS, making it easy to reach out to senior citizens for Covid-19 vaccination. Malaysia, on the other hand, has serious challenges in providing vaccine access to the elderly, many of whom live in the community with their families or on their own instead of care homes.\n\nThe over 62,000 no-shows at Covid-19 vaccination appointments in Kedah, Pahang, Kelantan, Perak, Negeri Sembilan, Melaka, Perlis, and Terengganu \u2013 attributed to lack of transport to PPVs and not checking the MySejahtera app for appointment dates \u2013 illustrate the immense difficulty in reaching the elderly population.\n\nBut this does not mean the government should abandon senior citizens and switch focus to easier targets.

Covid-19 vaccinations onsite at shopping malls for participating retail tenants is not profiteering, the Malaysia Shopping Malls Association (PPK Malaysia) said today.\n\nInstead, the association representing shopping malls claimed that the actual estimated cost for logistics and the health personnel needed to administer the Covid-19 vaccines could go up to RM100 and even RM150, and that the malls had actually decided to subsidise the cost with plans to only collect RM50.\n\nPPK Malaysia was speaking of the plans to have onsite Covid-19 vaccination at shopping malls for employees of retail outlets in the malls, through a \u201cpublic-private sector partnership\u201d model.\n\nWhile confirming that the Covid-19 vaccines will be provided by the Malaysian government for free under this partnership PPK Malaysia said shopping malls will be paying for the fees for doctors, nurses and medical officers to Health Ministry-owned ProtectHealth Corporation and all other antecedent costs.\n\nEarlier this week, notices had circulated on social media of purported plans by shopping malls to offer Covid-19 vaccination to retail tenants\u2019 staff at RM50 per person for two doses (with some giving a breakdown of RM15 for administration per dose and RM10 for logistics per dose).\n\nPPK Malaysia said the planned collection of RM50 was meant partly to secure commitment by retail staff to ensure that they would show up for the vaccination, as well as to pay for the services of administering the Covid-19 vaccine to be provided by the private healthcare providers coordinated by ProtectHealth Corporation.\n\n\u201cOur Association members estimated that the cost of providing the venue, logistics, manpower, standby ambulance service etc for the on-site vaccination centre will amount to RM100 to RM150 per pax, depending on volume and total number of doses available each day, the total population to be vaccinated and the duration to complete all the doses.\n\n\u201cIn the interests of the national agenda, it was decided that the malls shall largely subsidise these costs and be allowed to charge merely RM10 x 2 doses = RM20 per pax to partially defray their expenses and as a commitment by the registrant so as to mitigate absenteeism, leading to wastage of vaccines which would otherwise could be administered to those yet to be scheduled and in order to reach herd immunity of the community in the shortest possible time.\n\n\u201cWe were also informed that the doctors and nurses providing their service will be allocated by the Protect Health Corporation who will charge to administer per dose at RM15.\n\n\u201cTherefore, at RM15 per dose x 2 doses equalling RM30, plus the above nominal sum of RM20 to partially defray logistic expenses, a total of RM50 for 2 doses will be charged to participants, principally only our shopping frontliners,\u201d the shopping malls association explained in a statement today.\n\nCovid-19 vaccination urgently needed, speed is key\n\nIn the same statement, PPK Malaysia said it appreciates shopping malls for recognising the need to subsidise the Covid-19 vaccination costs for retail frontliners, in order to protect the retail industry through immunisation and as an overall corporate social responsibility (CSR) contribution towards the national agenda of urgently achieving herd immunity.\n\n\u201cIt has been proven in several overseas countries that the speed of vaccinations is the way to bring down the rate of infections, coupled with self-discipline and strict adherence to SOPs instead of prolonging the need for further MCOs,\u201d it said, referring to the movement control orders (MCO) in the country.\n\nNoting that the Covid-19 vaccination for the public is being planned on a different schedule, the association said the primary purpose for the partnership with the government was to vaccinate all employees of shopping malls and malls\u2019 business outlets, adding that it is believed that the malls would be \u201cmuch safer places for the public to shop with confidence and with peace of mind\u201d once such vaccination is carried out.\n\n\u201cDespite our good intentions, we are distraught with the negative comments in the media that malls are profiteering from this exercise which is extremely far from the truth,\u201d it said, adding that this statement was issued in order to correct and put the record straight.\n\nIt noted that the \u201curgent need for access to vaccination\u201d was reflected in the shopping malls\u2019 \u201centhusiastic participation\u201d and the \u201coverwhelming registration\u201d by mall employees and mall tenants for the proposed onsite Covid-19 vaccination at malls.\n\n\u201cWe truly look forward to the success of this win-win collaboration with the authorities towards the national objective of achieving herd immunity urgently and the ultimate recovery of the economy in due course,\u201d the association said.\n\nEarlier in the statement, PPK Malaysia explained the reasoning for the idea of vaccinating mall tenants\u2019 staff onsite at shopping malls, while also providing updates on the progress of this plan.\n\nCiting the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi\u2019s May 28 announcement of plans to vaccinate an estimated 500,000 employees in the retail industry under the country\u2019s economic frontliners (retail sector) Covid-19 immunisation programme, PPK Malaysia said it lauded the government\u2019s targeting of the relevant economic sectors to speed up the Covid-19 vaccination programme.\n\n\u201cShopping malls together with all retail tenants\u2019 staff are effectively frontliners and we feel that it is imperative for the vaccination exercise to be implemented expeditiously. When vaccinated, our frontliners will not only protect themselves but more importantly, duly protect the shoppers and the public.\n\n\u201cWe are also appreciative that our proposal for on-site vaccination centres at shopping malls is adopted as it is more efficient and logical to bring the medical personnel to come on-site to administer the vaccinations instead of all the staff having to take time off work to travel to outside vaccination centres, thus interrupting business and daily operations,\u201d PPK Malaysia said.\n\nIn the May 28 statement by the KPDNHEP minister, he too had spoken of his ministry\u2019s cooperation with the Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) for the vaccination of \u201ceconomic frontliners\u201d in the retail sector expected to start in June, and had also spoke on discussions involving CITF on the same day with 60 representatives from the retail industry.\n\nThe minister had also on May 28 spoken of his ministry\u2019s cooperation with PPK Malaysia, the Malaysia Retailers Association (MRA), and Malaysia Retail Chain Association (MRCA) to establish Covid-19 vaccination centres (PPVs) at strategic locations nationwide, while also urging all retail companies to join this vaccination programme to help achieve the government\u2019s target of vaccinating 80 per cent of the population before the year ends.\n\nToday, PPK Malaysia said such an initiative in collaboration with the authorities has received \u201centhusiastic response\u201d from its members malls and retailers, noting that more than 50 malls have already notified their interest to host PPVs nationwide.\n\n\u201cDetails of this programme and the confirmed locations are being finalised and will be announced, once approved in due course, and we do look forward to the rollout by end of June 2021 onwards as scheduled,\u201d it said, having noted that it had already had several meetings with the authorities on this public-private sector partnership for Covid-19 vaccination.\n\nAbout ProtectHealth Corporation\n\nOn its website, ProtectHealth Corporation Sdn Bhd states that the not-for-profit company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Health Ministry\u2019s ProtectHealth Malaysia. It further states that it was appointed by the ministry to implement the participation of private medical practitioners in the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme.\n\nBased on information on ProtectHealth\u2019s website, private general practitioners do not need to pay to participate in the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme, but would have to receive training and also prepare their own personal protective equipment.\n\nThe website also states that ProtectHealth would pay general practitioners RM14 for their administration of each dose of Covid-19 vaccines through clinic and community outreach models, while payment of RM45 per hour would be paid to them for Covid-19 vaccination under government-organised mass vaccination models.\n\nProtectHealth Corporation denied collecting payments from shopping centres purportedly rolling out Covid-19 inoculation drives with vaccinators from ProtectHealth Corp.\n\n\u201cProtectHealth involvement remains the same for all vaccination centres. We pay private medical practitioners RM14 per dose administered,\u201d Khairul Faizi from the corporate communications unit of ProtectHealth Corp told CodeBlue today.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t supply vaccines as our role is managing the private medical practitioners. The vaccine supply is done by the government, similar to other vaccination centres.\u201d\n\nHealth news portal CodeBlue yesterday reported ProtectHealth Corporation as stating its role as merely managing the private medical practitioners carrying out Covid-19 vaccination work and that it pays RM14 per dose administered to such private healthcare personnel.\n\nCodeBlue yesterday also reported ProtectHealth Corporation as denying collecting payments from shopping malls for Covid-19 vaccination in collaboration with the company. \u2013 MalayMail", "keyword": ["shopping", "fee",

a landmark decision, the Intellectual Property High Court in Kuala Lumpur has declared that the sale, offer for sale, distribution and/or supply of TV Boxes or illicit streaming devices (ISDs) that can provide unauthorised access to copyrighted works, constitutes copyright infringement under the Copyright Act 1987.\n\nThe action in the Intellectual Property High Court was brought by satellite operator Measat Broadcast Networks, the service provider for Malaysian pay-TV platform Astro, against a seller of ISDs preloaded with applications which act as gateways to websites or content servers streaming pirated content.\n\nThe historic judgment, considered to be the first by the Intellectual Property High Court, is positively received by the authorities and industry players in their battle against digital piracy. Industry leaders including Astro laud the High Court\u2019s judgement as a bold step in the right direction against piracy in Malaysia.\n\n\u201cThe declaration by the High Court that sale of ISD which allows access to unauthorised copyright content amounts to copyright infringement sets a precedent for future civil claims on copyright infringement against ISD sellers in the market, including those on e-commerce platforms,\u201d stated Laila Saat, Director, Regulatory of Astro. \u201cThis ground-breaking declaration will strengthen intellectual property protection in the country and ongoing anti-piracy efforts, which are pivotal to ensure continuous investment and job creation in Malaysia\u2019s media and entertainment industry. We will continue to work with authorities and content partners to send a strong message that content piracy is theft, illegal and punishable by law.\u201d\n\n\u201cMCMC welcomes the court\u2019s decision, this will strengthen the legal aspects in protecting copyright infringement and battle against piracy, especially in digital and networked forms,\u201d added Zulkarnain Mohd Yasin, Chief Regulatory Officer of the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC).\n\n\u201cAcknowledging that more proactive action is needed to fight digital piracy in the country, FINAS expresses full support for legal action taken by Astro against ISD sellers and all digital piracy activities as these illegal activities has caused the local creative industry a huge loss in revenue every year,\u201d commented Dr. Ahmad Idham Ahmad Nadzri, CEO of the National Film Development Corporation Malaysia (FINAS). \u201cIn driving more holistic and effective strategy battling digital piracy, FINAS has established the Digital Piracy Eradication Committee with the collective support and involvement of relevant law enforcement agencies to further empower and strengthen enforcement, regulations and the terms of distribution licences in line with the provisions under the FINAS Act 244 1981\u201d.\n\n\u201cMyIPO looks forward for cases concerning ISDs to be brought forward to the Malaysian court,\u201d said Zulkarnain Muhammad, Deputy Director General of the Intellectual Property Corporation of Malaysia (MyIPO). \u201cPrevalent and widespread use of ISDs cause far more economic harm than physical copyright piracy. These devices are part of a wider network of online copyright piracy, which will in the long run disincentive original creators from producing creative work. Copyright piracy in any form should be curbed and deterred.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision is the correct one and we welcome it whole-heartedly,\u201d declared Louis Boswell, CEO of the Asia Video Industry Association (AVIA). \u201cContent is not made for free, and it is the right of creators and distributors to charge for it. To circumvent this and steal it is theft, and I see little difference between the theft of physical goods and the theft of video streams. As a society we need to do more to recognise theft for what it is and this ruling is a strong step in that direction.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is an important and welcome declaration by the Intellectual Property High Court, and sends a clear message that the sale of ISDs that provide unauthorised access to copyrighted works constitutes copyright infringement,\u201d asserted Kevin Plumb, Premier League Director of Legal Services. \u201cThe Premier League is committed to pursuing all those involved with providing illegal access to Premier League content as well as working to raise awareness of the risks fans face when watching via unauthorised sources. We will continue to work with Astro and local authorities as part of our ongoing anti-piracy programme in Malaysia.\u201d\n\nThe estimated loss to the industry and Malaysian economy due to piracy is over RM3 billion (\u20ac590m) annually with RM500 million in taxes and thousands of jobs at risk.\n\nThe declaration by the High Court follows recent criminal cases successfully brought against ISD retailers. On February 8th, a company director of an IT company was charged at the Shah Alam Sessions Court under Section 41 (1) (ha) of the Copyright Act 1987 with promoting Long TV Android boxes which allow the bypassing of technological protection measures on copyright broadcast work. On February 16th, a woman director of a mobile accessory company pleaded guilty to a charge of possessing TV media boxes that contains software to illegally stream Astro\u2019s content via the Internet. She was fined RM30,000 under Section 232(2) of the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998, making her the first ISD seller to be charged under this provision.\n\nThe Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) reiterated that it will take stern action against suppliers and sellers who misuse devices and software to illegally access content protected by their copyright work

Court in Luak, Miri on last Friday as blatant abuse of power and inhumane by the police.\n\nAccording to Aidi, a team from the Miri district police station was sent to the premises at around 9.30am after they received a public tip-off that the stalls there were serving dine-in breakfast to customers.\n\n\u201cAt the premises, the team witnessed that one of the stall operator was in the midst of preparing dine-in dishes for her customers,\u201d said Aidi.\n\nThe team also reported that upon realising the presence of the police, a few of the customers quickly left the premises and a worker quickly cleared-up the table.\n\nAidi said the premises had violated the current SOP of \u2018no dining-in\u2019 as the tables and chairs appeared to have been arranged for dine-in purposes.\n\n\u201cInside the premises, a man was sitting alone at a table and ignored the presence of the police. He also refused to cooperate with the team when questioned,\u201d said Aidi, adding that police had no choice but to issue him a compound.\n\nHe said it was only after the issuance of compound that the man claimed that he was a stall operator and voiced out his dissatisfaction for being issued with a compound.\n\nAidi said the stall operator, who was eating at a table in the premises, had indirectly encouraged other customers to dine-in at the premises.\n\n\u201cFurther checks on the stall operator revealed that he only has a business licence and not a licence from the Miri City Council,\u201d Aidi added.\n\nTherefore, he said what Ling had claimed in his statement was utterly wrong as evidence could be found from the premises\u2019 closed-circuit television (CCTV).\n\n\u201cFrom this, there was no blatant abuse of power and inhumane act by the police as claimed by Ling,\u201d Aidi added.\n\nThe owner of the premise is also urged to handover a copy of the CCTV footage to the police for further investigation under the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Act 1988.\n\nMeanwhile, Aidi said the police are working together with the government in the fight to break the infection chain of the Covid-19 virus in Sarawak.\n\n\u201cThe infection rate of the virus in Sarawak is worrying and everyone is urged to abide to the SOP as set by the Malaysian National Security Council,\u201d he added.", "keyword": ["aidi", "dinein", "senator", "team", "claim", "sop", "abuse", "stall", "miri", "statement", "operator", "act", "premises", "denies", "power", "lings", "chief"], "summary": "\u201cAt the premises, the team witnessed that one of the stall operator was in the midst of preparing dine-in dishes for her customers,\u201d said Aidi.\nHe said it was only after the issuance of compound that the man claimed that he was a stall operator and voiced out his dissatisfaction for being issued with a compound.\nAidi said the stall operator, who was eating at a table in the premises, had indirectly encouraged other customers to dine-in at the premises.\n\u201cFurther checks on the stall operator revealed that he only has a business licence and not a licence from the Miri City Council,\u201d Aidi added.\n\u201cFrom this, there was no blatant abuse of power and inhumane act by the police as claimed by Ling,\u201d Aidi added.", "news": "The Borneo Post", "date": "2021-05-23 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Lead example, Lo tells politicians in curbing Covid-19 pandemic", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWJvcm5lb3Bvc3QuY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvMjIvbGVhZC1leGFtcGxlLWxvLXRlbGxzLXBvbGl0aWNpYW5zLWluLWN1cmJpbmctY292aWQtMTktcGFuZGVtaWMv0gEA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2019/04/Andrew-Lo.jpeg", "text": "KUCHING (May 22): The Malaysian Trade Union Congress (MTUC) Sarawak has demanded for leadership by example in efforts to flatten the Covid-19 pandemic curve in the country.\n\nIts secretary Andrew Lo said until and unless the national and state political leaders step up and demonstrate leadership by example, Malaysia, including Sarawak, will not see an end to the Covid-19 pandemic any time soon.\n\nHe said MTUC Sarawak was quite amused by the Prime Minister\u2019s announcement that the National Security Council will tighten enforcement of the Movement Control Order (MCO) 3.0.\n\nThe Prime Minister, he noted, had inadvertently admitted that there had been loose enforcement the past 15 months.\n\n\u201cMTUC certainly does not condone any non-compliance of the standard operating procedures (SOP) and MCO.\n\n\u201cHowever we must question the many cases of Ministers and very important peoples (VIPs) that appears not to follow these restrictions and got off with a slap of the wrist, at most.\n\n\u201cWe even have Minister that was out of the country for weeks.

Could it be that PBS, just like Warisan, had also rejected Kitingan\u2019s overtures to officially join PN?\u201d he said in a statement today.\n\nKitingan, who heads STAR, a PN component party, had earlier today said he was open to the idea of opposition party Warisan joining the ruling coalition.\n\nThe Keningau MP said STAR was open to the idea and believed everybody should be invited into PN, including Warisan.\n\n\u201cThey have assemblymen who want to serve their constituencies. So, why not do this together?\n\n\u201cGRS is open (to the idea) and we have discussed it actually. Even the chief minister is open to it,\u201d Kitingan said.\n\nAlthough Warisan has rejected Kitingan\u2019s offer, the party has not, however, addressed the invitation initially made by PBS president Maximus Ongkili to join PN.\n\nOngkili had yesterday clarified remarks he made that he was willing to work with any opposition party, including Warisan.\n\nOngkili said his actual intention was to express PBS\u2019 openness to have Warisan cooperate with the state and federal governments to achieve their common development goals for the good of Sabah and Sabahans.\n\nIn his statement today, Siambun said Kitingan should realise that Warisan president Shafie Apdal\u2019s reply on his preference to work with PBS was merely a response to a question by a journalist on whether there had been any discussion with other parties on a potential partnership.\n\n\u201cShafie\u2019s preference to work with PBS was because it shares similar struggles for Sabahans as Warisan and that Ongkili is a long-time personal friend of Shafie and a consistent advocate on Sabah\u2019s rights as well.\n\n\u201cPBS is also a state-based party that had been consistent throughout these years since its formation and had been a victim of party-hopping,\u201d he said, referring to the fall of the PBS government after the state elections in 1994.\n\nSiambun also pointed out that the unique position held by PBS in the government allows it to determine the course and direction of the party without being dictated by others.\n\n\u201cPBS is not an official component member of Barisan Nasional or PN but only supports the government of the day. The support we give is contingent upon ensuring the Malaysia Agreement 1963 is wholly implemented.\n\n\u201cThis could be the reason why Ongkili was given the task to helm the Sabah and Sarawak affairs ministry in the Prime Minister\u2019s Department,\u201d he said.\n\nSiambun also said Warisan did not wish to be associated with PAS that had rejected a bill to amend Article 1(2) of the Federal Constitution.\n\nThe bill was intended to reinstate Sabah and Sarawak to their original status prior to a 1976 constitutional amendment.\n\nHe said Kitingan, whose STAR party is a formal member of PN, also worked closely with PAS, which had outrightly rejected the bill initiated by the late Liew Vui Keong, the former de facto law minister.\n\nHe said Kitingan should clarify why he is willing to work with PAS which has a nominated assemblyman in the Sabah state assembly now.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["open", "laughs", "party", "work", "warisan", "state", "pbs", "pn", "join", "invitation", "kitingan", "rejected", "jeffreys"], "summary": "KOTA KINABALU: State opposition party Warisan has declined an invitation by Perikatan Nasional deputy chairman Jeffrey Kitingan to join the ruling coalition, saying the invite was \u201chumorous\u201d.\nCould it be that PBS, just like Warisan, had also rejected Kitingan\u2019s overtures to officially join PN?\u201d he said in a statement today.\nKitingan, who heads STAR, a PN component party, had earlier today said he was open to the idea of opposition party Warisan joining the ruling coalition.\nThe Keningau MP said STAR was open to the idea and believed everybody should be invited into PN, including Warisan.\nAlthough Warisan has rejected Kitingan\u2019s offer, the party has not, however, addressed the invitation initially made by PBS president Maximus Ongkili to join PN.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-05-21 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "AirAsia\u2019s digital businesses to become Asean\u2019s leading super app", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWFsYXlzaWFucmVzZXJ2ZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNS8yOC9haXJhc2lhcy1kaWdpdGFsLWJ1c2luZXNzZXMtdG8tYmVjb21lLWFzZWFucy1sZWFkaW5nLXN1cGVyLWFwcC_SAW5odHRwczovL3RoZW1hbGF5c2lhbnJlc2VydmUuY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvMjgvYWlyYXNpYXMtZGlnaXRhbC1idXNpbmVzc2VzLXRvLWJlY29tZS1hc2VhbnMtbGVhZGluZy1zdXBlci1hcHAvYW1wLw?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://themalaysianreserve.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/AIRASIA-APP.jpg", "text": "By AZALEA AZUAR / Pic credit: airasia.com\n\nAirAsia Group Bhd\u2019s non-airline digital businesses is on the right track to becoming Asean\u2019s digital travel and lifestyle platform as it meets strong consumer demands.\n\nIts super app is now considered one of the region\u2019s top three online travel agencies (OTA) while AirAsia\u2019s e-wallet BigPay is set to become the first virtual bank and its delivery service Teleport is strengthening.\n\nDuring the group\u2019s first quarter of 2021 (1Q21) financial performance announcement on May 27, AirAsia super app posted a 45% year-on-year (YoY) increase in its revenue to RM10 million supported by solid growth of products and services available on the platform.\n\nTeleport\u2019s revenue has also tripled compared to its 1Q20 performance.\n\nAccording to AirAsia Group CEO Tan Sri Tony Fernandes, just as they revolutionised air travel 20 years ago with their low-cost carrier, AirAsia is now disrupting and democratising the lifestyle industry again through the development of their super app with over 17 travel and products leveraging off one another.\n\n\u201cIn just over a year we are now one of the top three leading online travel agencies (OTAs) in Asean based on website traffic, with over 100 million average page views monthly on airasia.com.\n\n\u201cIn the future, when travel resumes in our key markets, we can guarantee best value prices for our flight and hotel packages because we own our own airline,\u201d he explained in a press release today.\n\nExpansion of its popular products and services to its Asean markets for its super app is in AirAsia\u2019s pipeline.\n\n\u201cWe are working on expanding our health services in Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines, while offering SNAP hotel and accommodation deals in Vietnam and Singapore in the near future,\u201d said Fernandes.\n\nHe also said that Teleport not only provides the usual deliveries but has now been delivering vaccines all over Malaysia and the Asean region. Hence, it has created more than 4,000 delivery driver jobs in 17 key markets.\n\n\u201cWe are also looking forward to converting passenger planes into freighters in the coming months to cater for unprecedented cargo demand,\u201d he said.\n\nFernandes added that the group has plans to improve its BigPay e-wallet to become the best virtual bank in Asean.\n\n\u201cWe are tapping into the full potential of our loyalty platform BIG Rewards, to provide the best range for rewards and redemption in Asean and beyond.\n\n\u201cThrough our digital ecosystem, we have already created thousands of jobs and supported more than 3,500 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Malaysia.\n\n\u201cOur training centre, AirAsia Academy (currently known as Redbeat Academy), offers affordable digital and tech training courses to equip not only our own employees, but also SMEs and members of the public, with skills to bridge the technology gap in Malaysia and beyond in this ever changing digital world,\u201d he said.\n\nApart from AirAsia\u2019s digital services, its other non-airline businesses such as AirAsia Food, AirAsia Fresh, AirAsia Shop and its Santan franchise restaurants are also penetrating into new markets.\n\n\u201cAs we continue to expand our digital footprint in Malaysia and other Asean countries, our contribution in the region will only increase and become more significant from here onwards.\n\n\u201cWe saw the crisis as an opportunity to use the downtime in flying caused by the pandemic to leverage the strength of our database of over 60 million customers and to focus on developing new non airline revenue streams in the key areas of e-commerce, fintech and logistics,\u201d Fernandes commented.\n\nAirAsia has more innovations to roll out such as the ride-hailing \u201cAirAsia Ride\u201d, which will be launched in the coming months, as well as the potential of drone delivery.\n\nThe group is also planning for electric or hydronic aeroplanes to meet consumer\u2019s sustainability needs.\n\n\u201cIn the airline business, Asia Digital Engineering (ADE) is set to become one of the region\u2019s best value aircraft maintenance and overhaul providers for both short term line maintenance and longer-term base maintenance, a space previously dominated by Singapore-based maintenance and overhaul companies (MROs).\n\n\u201cI firmly believe ADE will become the leading aircraft maintenance/overhaul company in the region in the near future with significant potential growth opportunities in Asean and beyond with service excellence and the lowest cost base,\u201d he said.\n\nAirAsia is also working to launch more contactless technologies to make flying a seamless and hygienic experience when it resumes.\n\nThis includes a digital passport called Scan2Fly where passengers can upload required medical documentation and have it verified in real time online, before heading to the airport.\n\nThe group would also be introducing FACES, its biometric facial recognition technology at Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2 (KLIA 2) and it will be rolled out across all key destinations.\n\n\u201cThere is a silver lining to every crisis and the best thing to come out of this pandemic is our recovery as a stronger, more resilient travel and lifestyle platform \u2013 not solely reliant on airfares alone anymore,\u201d said Fernandes.\n\nThe \u201cnew look\u201d AirAsia would be embarking on an exciting new phase of growth, with the right focus and foundations to better meet the needs of the digital revolution.\n\nFernandes stressed that they would remain true to their promise of delivering high quality service serving the underserved by making it affordable to fly, stay, shop, eat and upskill.\n\n\u201cLooking out for the everyday people is what we do best and we aim to continue to support them, not only in the major cities, but also in the smaller cities we serve, where many people are struggling the most and access to products and services are more limited.\u201d", "keyword": ["asean", "maintenance", "aseans", "travel", "services", "super", "app", "airasias", "airasia",

open and detailed revelation of an intrusion by China\u2019s air force has raised many questions that the government needs to answer, says an expert in defence and diplomacy matters.\n\n\u201cThe biggest question is how the government, in particular Wisma Putra, is going to resolve it?\u201d asked the expert, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nThe expert said, however, that the RMAF\u2019s \u201cextremely rare\u201d move to reveal details of the incident which saw its fighter jets being scrambled to intercept 16 People\u2019s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) planes in Malaysia\u2019s maritime zone (ZMM), provided a \u201cgolden opportunity\u201d for the country.\n\nThe source said while the possibility that the PLAAF was carrying out surveillance in the area could not be ruled out, the Chinese could also have been \u201ctesting the waters\u201d over Malaysia\u2019s air defence systems and its reaction.\n\nThe \u201cbreach of Malaysian airspace and sovereignty\u201d \u2013 as foreign affairs minister Hishammuddin Hussein termed it \u2013 by the Chinese aircraft is the latest in a series of actions by China in the disputed South China Sea that has its neighbours worried.\n\nFor years, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei, Taiwan and Vietnam have been contesting China\u2019s claim to almost all of the South China Sea. These countries have often protested against China over what they claimed were intrusions into their territories.\n\nIn recent years, the dispute over the sea has seen a rise in tensions not only between China and these nations but also between China and the US. As recent as May 20, China and the US exchanged strong words over US naval activity in the region.\n\nThe expert asked what the rules of engagement would have been had the Chinese planes not turned back when the RMAF scrambled its jets.\n\n\u201cTypically, when an air force is confronted with such a situation, they would fire a warning shot or resort to aggressive manoeuvres to \u2018force\u2019 the foreign planes to turn back. Were our Hawks armed for engagement? How many Hawks were deployed?\n\n\u201cMy question is why did we scramble our Hawk 208 fighters? Those are advanced trainer jets, light fighter jets. They do not have the same interception capabilities of our Sukhoi Su-30MKM or F/A-18 Hornets.\n\n\u201cAre they airworthy? Or were the Hawks deployed because they are closest to that part of the South China Sea? If so, why are we not stationing more advanced fighters closer to the region?\u201d\n\nHe commended Hishammuddin for saying Wisma Putra would summon the Chinese ambassador to explain the incident.\n\nThe Chinese, the expert said, had already said the flight by the 16 planes was routine training and that it had not entered any other country\u2019s territorial air space under international law.\n\n\u201cEssentially, the Chinese are saying they have done nothing wrong. But Wisma Putra wants an explanation on the breach of Malaysian airspace and sovereignty.\n\n\u201cSo who is telling the truth? And what happens next? Will China apologise? I doubt they will, given their stance on the South China Sea.\u201d\n\nThe expert said if Wisma Putra was not satisfied with China\u2019s explanation and if the country refused to apologise, Malaysia should take the \u201cbold\u201d step of expelling the Chinese ambassador and recalling the Malaysian ambassador in China.\n\n\u201cIn diplomatic lexicon, expelling an ambassador is a very serious statement. I think if we do not do so, we (Malaysia) run the risk of looking weak.\u201d\n\nStill, the expert said, the incident provided Malaysia with the \u201cgolden opportunity\u201d to analyse and address defence issues, including the placement of frontline fighter jets and pattern of violations by foreign forces, particularly in the hotly disputed South China Sea.\n\nMeanwhile, defence analyst Lam Choong Wah said Asean and China were currently negotiating a code of conduct (CoC) for the South China Sea and that these negotiations needed to be sped up to regulate the behaviour of military operations in the region.\n\n\u201cMalaysia should utilise all available diplomatic channels to handle the issue to preserve national interests,\u201d Lam said.\n\n\u201cBeing firm or soft is not the crux of the problem. The core issue is there is no CoC in place to regulate military behavior in disputed areas, and until there is a CoC, military or maritime enforcement standoffs will take place from time to time.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["expert", "force", "wisma", "planes", "south", "malaysian", "chinese", "jets", "chinas", "intrusion", "putrajaya", "resolve", "sea", "putra"], "summary": "\u201cThe biggest question is how the government, in particular Wisma Putra, is going to resolve it?\u201d asked the expert, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.\nFor years, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei, Taiwan and Vietnam have been contesting China\u2019s claim to almost all of the South China Sea.\nThe expert asked what the rules of engagement would have been had the Chinese planes not turned back when the RMAF scrambled its jets.\n\u201cTypically, when an air force is confronted with such a situation, they would fire a warning shot or resort to aggressive manoeuvres to \u2018force\u2019 the foreign planes to turn back.\nBut Wisma Putra wants an explanation on the breach of Malaysian airspace and sovereignty.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-06-03 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Take more from KWAN to help M40, B40 groups, says Najib", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wNi8wMi90YWtlLW1vcmUtZnJvbS1rd2FuLXRvLWhlbHAtbTQwLWI0MC1ncm91cHMtc2F5cy1uYWppYi_SAQA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Fmt Reporters"], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/02-PANIC-BUYING-MC0-3.0.jpg", "text": "PETALING JAYA: Former prime minister Najib Razak has urged the government to take another RM4.2 billion from the National Trust Fund (KWAN) to assist the (bottom 40) B40 and (middle 40) M40 groups during the total lockdown.\n\nIn a Facebook post, he assured that Barisan Nasional would replenish the funds in the future.\n\nNajib also questioned if the current allocation of RM100 each for single Malaysians and RM500 for each B40 household with at least three children was sufficient.\n\n\u201cOn top of that, this assistance comes after they have faced MCO 2.0 and MCO 3.0/3.1 for five months, and now the total lockdown,\u201d he said.\n\nNajib noted that the payments would only come in by the end of June, while the additional RM500 for the Prihatin Special Grant (GKP) recipients was due in July.\n\nHe added that GKP recipients should also be eligible for Bantuan Prihatin Rakyat, as they had the additional burden of bearing the losses faced by their businesses.\n\nNajib said the Perikatan Nasional administration could dip into KWAN again if it wished to avoid borrowing more money, since it had already borrowed over RM100 billion for BPR aid within the first five months of the year.\n\nWith the additional funds from KWAN, Najib said, more could be handed out under the Bantuan Prihatin aid scheme.\n\n\u201cThe RM300 to RM500 will become RM900 to RM1,500 for B40 families.

It\u2019s sad at first, but whatever happened, happened and it\u2019s best to move on and be strong,\u201d said the 33-year-old content creator from Selangor, when we spoke on Sunday (30 May).\n\nFahmi had been confirmed positive with Covid-19 after getting tested at the Covid Assessment Centre (CAC) in Stadium Melawati, Shah Alam on 21 May. That same day, he was sent straight to the PKRC to undergo more than a week of mandatory quarantine.\n\n\u201cI have three days to go. They count it from the day you first did your swab test and 10 days after that.\u201d he explained, mentioning how all of his close contacts were fortunate enough to have not contracted the virus.\n\nSharing his experiences, Fahmi revealed how his body had reacted over the course of his infection.\n\nMy symptoms came in pretty late, each day one symptom. First came the sore throat, fever the day after, then I started to lose my sense of smell and taste, then I started to feel heavy breathing and panting. But nothing serious. That\u2019s why they sent me to MAEPS because here they have the equipment to scan my lungs.\n\nFahmi also said that the medical staff stationed at the PKRC had been very reliable and responsive to his needs and everyone else who\u2019s there.\n\nQuarantine life\n\nWith thousands of other Covid-19 patients confined together at the \u2018DG Hall\u2019 in MAEPS, Fahmi noted his shock when first arriving at the PKRC and said that quarantine life took some getting used to.\n\n\u201cI was of course surprised by the insane number of people here, to the point that there are not enough beds. People have to sleep on mattresses on the floor,\u201d he said, adding that without any appropriate shower facility there, patients also have to contend with long bathroom lines and having to bathe on the toilet.\n\nHowever, despite the minor discomforts, Fahmi said everything at the PKRC had been satisfactory and personally relates life in quarantine to what people might find in boarding schools.\n\n\u201cFood is served three times a day. Breakfast is at 8 am, lunch at 12 noon and dinner at 6 pm.

The key to surviving here is to just make friends to keep yourself sane.\n\nWith the time spent living with a deadly disease and after having been in the Covid-19 isolation camp, Fahmi said that the best way to overcome it all is with positive thinking and not giving up.\n\nI was scared, anything could happen and I was afraid I wasn\u2019t going to come back.

Let\u2019s find out.\n\nThe phone looks pretty good on the back too, so when you\u2019re taking pictures of other people at least they\u2019ll be looking towards you. (Credit: TRP)\n\nA phone catered to selfie enthusiasts\n\nAs advertised by the company, the V21\u2019s main selling point has to be its selfie camera with tonnes of options for you to play with such as adjusting brightness all the way, to toning your cheeks.\n\nAnd apparently, having nifty software tricks is not enough for the Chinese manufacturer as the phone is also fitted with \u2013 wait for it \u2013 two built-in flashlights which the company calls Dual Selfie Spotlight located on the front of the phone.\n\nYou know, just in case you\u2019re in a really, really, dark room and thought that this might be the best time to take a selfie.\n\nCredit: TRP\n\nThe V21 can even guide you on how to take a good selfie \u2013 complete with outlines showing you how to pose and take the shot.\n\nThe back camera is pretty good too if you\u2019re under good sunlight and it has three different lenses for you to choose from.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good in the hand and it\u2019s pretty too\n\nAlthough this phone has a screen size of 6.44 inches, the phone actually feels good in the hand and isn\u2019t super huge thanks to a design that stretches the panel out to the edge of the phone.\n\nIf you\u2019re a bit conservative and want your phone to blend in the background, there\u2019s the Dusk Blue colour option, but if you want it to get everyone\u2019s attention including your own, there\u2019s also Sunset Dazzle which is a real looker.\n\nThe colours on the body of the phone shift when you look at it from different angles which might entice some folks who want their phone to have a slightly funkier colour palette rather than having it just plain old black or white.\n\nCredit: TRP\n\nAll day phone\n\nThe Vivo V21 has quite a slim profile but don\u2019t think that it\u2019s not beefed up in the battery department because the phone can last you a full day even if you\u2019re consuming a lot of content.\n\nThere\u2019s also the option of fast charging if you manage to drain that big battery and they\u2019re not messing about. It\u2019s actually possible to get this thing from 0 to roughly above 50% within half an hour.\n\nCredit: TRP\n\nNot really a gaming phone\n\nThe phone might tick many boxes but gaming is not one of them.\n\nYes, you can play graphic intensive games like COD Mobile or PUBG Mobile, but I noticed that the V21 doesn\u2019t allow you to max out the settings, which might be a dealbreaker for some but if you\u2019re playing casual games, it will work just fine.\n\nShould you get the V21?\n\nIt\u2019s a great phone if you\u2019re someone who likes to take a lot of selfies as this where the phone truly shines. Literally.\n\nThere are not many phones that can say that they have one, let alone two flashes for the front camera and the amount of options is great for those who want to tweak their selfies.\n\nApart from the front camera, the V21 is also capable in other areas such as having a great screen for watching stuff like YouTube or Netflix, a pretty design, and also a large battery with the option of fast charging that borders on ridiculous.\n\nThe Vivo V21 is an affordable package and that not only looks good, but it feels good to use too.\n\nCredit: TRP\n\nShare your thoughts with us via TRP\u2019s Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.", "keyword": ["really", "youre", "camera", "phone", "good", "v21", "pretty", "taking", "having", "selfies", "vivo", "selfie", "review", "option"], "summary": "Vivo recently came out with the V21, a phone that takes aim at those who like to take a lot of selfies.\nBut, is a selfie camera really enough to entice you to get this phone?\nThe phone looks pretty good on the back too, so when you\u2019re taking pictures of other people at least they\u2019ll be looking towards you.\nYou know, just in case you\u2019re in a really, really, dark room and thought that this might be the best time to take a selfie.\nIt\u2019s a great phone if you\u2019re someone who likes to take a lot of selfies as this where the phone truly shines.", "news": "The Rakyat Post", "date": "2021-06-02 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "We need to prepare for the worst, says health DG", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wNS8yNS93ZS1uZWVkLXRvLXByZXBhcmUtZm9yLXRoZS13b3JzdC1zYXlzLWhlYWx0aC1kZy_SAQA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/noor-hisham-abdullah-fmt-080521-2.jpg", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: Health director-general Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah urged the public to prepare for the worst in facing the Covid-19 wave following an exponential trend indicated by the Covid-19 graph in this country.\n\n\u201cThe rise in cases started from April 1 and could trigger a vertical surge.

assured the people of Kapit, Song, Bukit Mabong, and Belaga districts that there are sufficient supplies of essential food items throughout this Gawai Dayak season.\n\nThe ministry\u2019s Kapit chief Al-Redzamani Abdul Razak said 10 items have been listed under the Festive Season Maximum Price Control Scheme (SHMMP) for Gawai until June 3.\n\nThey are live chicken, standard chicken (slaughtered and cleaned with legs, heads, liver and giblets or any part thereof), super chicken (slaughtered and cleaned, without legs, head, liver and giblets), Grade A chicken eggs (weighing between 65g and 69.9g), Grade B chicken eggs (weighing between 60g and 64.9g each), Grade C chicken eggs (weighing between 55g and 59.9g each), live old chicken, chicken wings, pork (belly), and pork (meat and fat).\n\n\u201cBased on our regular inspection and also the feedback from both retailers and suppliers, the supply level is stable and should be sufficient to meet the demands.\n\n\u201cNonetheless, our KPDNHEP teams continue to closely supervise and monitor the selling and buying trends during the current Movement Control Order (MCO) period, as well as to ensure every trader comply strictly with the price-control scheme for Gawai 2021.\n\n\u201cWe aim to advocate a healthy business environment and a win-win situation between the traders and the consumers,\u201d Al Redzamani said in a statement.\n\nHe also warned stern action would await any trader caught raising the price of any of the controlled items during the SHMMP Gawai 2021 period.\n\n\u201cAny consumer who finds any trader not abiding by the scheme, or notices other unscrupulous trading practices, can lodge a report by calling our hotline 1-800-886-800, or send WhatsApp texts via 019-2794317.\n\n\u201cAlso, seek KPDNHEP on Facebook, or go to Kapit KPDNHEP Office behind Meligai Hotel, which is open from 8am to 5pm on every regular working day,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, a survey here yesterday showed many shoppers stocking up not only for the Gawai Dayak celebration, but also for the the statewide MCO, which takes effect today.\n\nThe Terasang Market, Pasar Tani Kapit, Kapit Night Street Market, cold storage, and various supermarkets were crowded with more customers than usual.\n\nA local resident, who wish to be identified only as \u2018Madam Chen\u2019, said her husband reminded her to buy extra vegetables and meat for their family\u2019s consumption over the next few days.\n\n\u201cI bought various green vegetables, some pork, and also fish \u2013- these should last us for the next few days.\n\n\u201cWe, the adults, do not mind much, but the children are the ones who need more food to grow,\u201d the housewife from Jalan Selirik said when met at Terasang Market yesterday.\n\nPenghulu Allan Tubam said he had spent most of his time at his longhouse throughout the various stages of MCO.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t come down to Kapit town, unless there\u2019s some urgent or official duties that have to be attended to.\n\n\u201cI believe in looking after myself and my family as much as possible. I want to protect them from Covid-19. As a community leader, I need to set a good example for my followers,\u201d he said, adding that he and other community leaders had come to get their Covid-19 vaccination.\n\n\u201cThis morning (yesterday), I took the opportunity to buy some extra food, some drinks before returning to my longhouse.\n\n\u201cWith the MCO taking effect on May 29, I wouldn\u2019t do any Gawai shopping.

Earlier today, we were told that Perodua\u2019s Sentral facility in Section 19, Petaling Jaya remained closed, including its after-sales department. According to a source, the company is expected to make an announcement on the matter soon.\n\nLikewise, Edaran Tan Chong Motor (ETCM) announced yesterday via a FB post that all Nissan workshops are temporarily closed, pending application for operation. The company has not yet updated the status of its after-sales activities as of this point.\n\nMeanwhile, Honda dealerships that have obtained approval for after-sales service to continue have begun doing so. However, we were told by a source that not all Honda service centres are operational at this point, although more dealerships are attempting to get approval to operate their SCs. Honda Malaysia had previously announced that it would continue offering after-sales services during the lockdown period.\n\nThis is also the case with workshops and parts businesses, as approval by authorities is needed to open for business. Relevant documents are also necessary to ensure staff meet the necessary travel protocols. With enforcement being reportedly strict, many businesses allowed to operate during the FMCO are choosing to remain closed until they can obtain the necessary approval letters.\n\nEarlier, domestic trade and consumer affairs (KPDNHEP) minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi had stated that service centres as well as vehicle repair (body and paint) facilities would be allowed to operate during the lockdown, at 60% worker capacity. All businesses will have to comply with tight standard operating procedures (SOPs) and all local authority directives.\n\nCar sales have of course stopped during the two-week period, as well as that for vehicle inspections and registrations, as both Puspakom and the road transport department (JPJ) have announced that no business will be done during the lockdown.

According to the statement released by the ministry yesterday, customers can only stay in retail stores or shopping malls for a maximum duration of two hours once the new directive is put in place tomorrow.\n\nSo, who will be responsible for monitoring this time limit? Based on another document that was released earlier today, the responsibility falls on the retail store and shopping mall operators themselves.

A brutal new wave of the Covid-19 epidemic killed a record high 1,290 people last month.\n\nPPK Malaysia\u2019s circular stated that a total of RM30 per person will be charged as administration fee (RM15 per dose) and another RM20 per person for logistic expenditure (RM10 per dose). The RM30 fee for two doses is supposedly paid to ProtectHealth Corporation, a company owned by the Ministry of Health (MOH) that manages private medical practitioners who sign up as vaccinators under PICK.\n\nCodeBlue contacted PPK Malaysia \u2014 which represents major shopping centres in the Klang Valley and other states \u2014 to verify the authenticity of the circular.

We pay private medical practitioners RM14 per dose administered,\u201d Khairul Faizi from the corporate communications unit of ProtectHealth Corp told CodeBlue today.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t supply vaccines as our role is managing the private medical practitioners.

ProtectHealth Corporation \u2013 a Ministry of Health (MOH) owned company whose board includes the Health director-general and MOH secretary-general \u2013 and the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) \u2013 which appears to oversee the so-called \u201ceconomic frontliners vaccination programme\u201d for the retail sector \u2013 have denied collecting payments for the vaccine rollouts by shopping centres.\n\nSo, what are shopping centres collecting the money for? If ProtectHealth is already covering the cost of vaccine administration by paying vaccinators RM14 per dose administered, is the RM50 fee to cover the cost of venue rental for setting up vaccination centres (PPVs) at malls? Even then, this seems excessive.\n\nPharmaniaga Bhd, on the other hand, is expected to immediately deliver Sinovac\u2019s coronavirus vaccines to state governments and the private sector, despite Vaccine Minister Khairy Jamaluddin\u2019s previous assertion that the federal government\u2019s order of 12 million doses must be fulfilled in its entirety \u2013 estimated end July \u2013 before Pharmaniaga begins work on other orders.\n\nWith Health Minister Dr Adham Baba and Senior Defence Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob\u2019s latest statement yesterday (Pharmaniaga is controlled by the Armed Forces Fund Board) on Pharmaniaga\u2019s vaccine distribution to states and companies running parallel with PICK, it is unclear if Pharmaniaga can fully deliver the federal government\u2019s order by the end-July target.\n\nWhy is CITF diverting Covid-19 vaccines away from PICK when we have inoculated just a fraction of the 9.4 million targeted individuals who face the highest risk of developing severe disease or dying from Covid-19 \u2013 the elderly, people with comorbidities, and the disabled community?\n\nAs of May 31, just about two million people have received at least one dose of the vaccine. Assuming that about a million of these individuals are frontline workers from the first phase of PICK and young adults who signed up for the AstraZeneca-Oxford jab (numbers are likely higher), that means Malaysia has vaccinated only a million high-risk individuals, or 11 per cent of the 9.4 million targeted.\n\nCITF has yet to publish statistics on the number of high-risk people who have received Covid-19 vaccines so far.\n\nIn the month of May alone, 1,290 people lost their lives to Covid-19 in Malaysia, nearly triple the 471 fatalities recorded in the whole of last year. Although an increasing number of younger adults are dying from Covid-19 in the new wave of the Malaysian epidemic, the elderly remain the primary victims.\n\nAbout 74 per cent of 1,290 people who died from Covid-19 last month, or 955 individuals, were aged 60 years and above. Nearly nine in 10 victims had underlying health conditions, 75 per cent of whom were aged 60 or older.\n\nDozens of people have been dying from Covid-19 every day in Malaysia in the past three weeks. When hospitals and intensive care units (ICUs) are full, our vaccination strategy should focus on reducing the number of people with Covid-19 requiring hospital or critical care, not to cut infections.\n\nPeople who receive vaccination can still contract Covid-19 and possibly infect others, but all approved coronavirus vaccines prevent severe disease and death.\n\nChasing illusory single-digit daily infections \u2013 or even triple-digit infections at this point \u2013 is an impossible endeavour that will take at least six months or even a year, depending on how fast we can inoculate two-thirds of our adult population. As of yesterday, only about 8 per cent of Malaysia\u2019s adult population has received at least one dose.\n\nIf CITF is now changing its vaccination strategy to focus on working adults to prevent further economically devastating lockdowns, then CITF should make this clear. In a scenario with limited resources \u2013 vaccine supply, manpower to run PPVs, and outreach efforts \u2013 there must be priority groups in whichever strategy, whether it\u2019s to protect the most vulnerable or to keep the economy going.\n\nThe UK recorded zero new Covid-19 deaths yesterday for the first time since July 2020. This achievement came after the UK took about six months to vaccinate nearly 75 per cent of the adult population, or over 39 million people, with at least one vaccine dose.\n\nThe UK\u2019s coronavirus vaccination programme, which opened up in phases according to age, hit its target of offering a first jab to all those in top priority groups \u2013 those aged 50 or older as well as people in high-risk categories \u2013 before April 15.\n\nEngland and Scotland have now started offering first vaccines to people aged 30 and above, while Northern Ireland and Wales have begun vaccinating over-18s. Due to the emergence of the variant first discovered in India, renamed the \u201cDelta\u201d variant, England is accelerating second vaccine doses to adults aged 50 and above.\n\nThe UK has the benefit of most residents, including non-nationals, being registered with its NHS, making it easy to reach out to senior citizens for Covid-19 vaccination. Malaysia, on the other hand, has serious challenges in providing vaccine access to the elderly, many of whom live in the community with their families or on their own instead of care homes.\n\nThe over 62,000 no-shows at Covid-19 vaccination appointments in Kedah, Pahang, Kelantan, Perak, Negeri Sembilan, Melaka, Perlis, and Terengganu \u2013 attributed to lack of transport to PPVs and not checking the MySejahtera app for appointment dates \u2013 illustrate the immense difficulty in reaching the elderly population.\n\nBut this does not mean the government should abandon senior citizens and switch focus to easier targets.

Covid-19 vaccinations onsite at shopping malls for participating retail tenants is not profiteering, the Malaysia Shopping Malls Association (PPK Malaysia) said today.\n\nInstead, the association representing shopping malls claimed that the actual estimated cost for logistics and the health personnel needed to administer the Covid-19 vaccines could go up to RM100 and even RM150, and that the malls had actually decided to subsidise the cost with plans to only collect RM50.\n\nPPK Malaysia was speaking of the plans to have onsite Covid-19 vaccination at shopping malls for employees of retail outlets in the malls, through a \u201cpublic-private sector partnership\u201d model.\n\nWhile confirming that the Covid-19 vaccines will be provided by the Malaysian government for free under this partnership PPK Malaysia said shopping malls will be paying for the fees for doctors, nurses and medical officers to Health Ministry-owned ProtectHealth Corporation and all other antecedent costs.\n\nEarlier this week, notices had circulated on social media of purported plans by shopping malls to offer Covid-19 vaccination to retail tenants\u2019 staff at RM50 per person for two doses (with some giving a breakdown of RM15 for administration per dose and RM10 for logistics per dose).\n\nPPK Malaysia said the planned collection of RM50 was meant partly to secure commitment by retail staff to ensure that they would show up for the vaccination, as well as to pay for the services of administering the Covid-19 vaccine to be provided by the private healthcare providers coordinated by ProtectHealth Corporation.\n\n\u201cOur Association members estimated that the cost of providing the venue, logistics, manpower, standby ambulance service etc for the on-site vaccination centre will amount to RM100 to RM150 per pax, depending on volume and total number of doses available each day, the total population to be vaccinated and the duration to complete all the doses.\n\n\u201cIn the interests of the national agenda, it was decided that the malls shall largely subsidise these costs and be allowed to charge merely RM10 x 2 doses = RM20 per pax to partially defray their expenses and as a commitment by the registrant so as to mitigate absenteeism, leading to wastage of vaccines which would otherwise could be administered to those yet to be scheduled and in order to reach herd immunity of the community in the shortest possible time.\n\n\u201cWe were also informed that the doctors and nurses providing their service will be allocated by the Protect Health Corporation who will charge to administer per dose at RM15.\n\n\u201cTherefore, at RM15 per dose x 2 doses equalling RM30, plus the above nominal sum of RM20 to partially defray logistic expenses, a total of RM50 for 2 doses will be charged to participants, principally only our shopping frontliners,\u201d the shopping malls association explained in a statement today.\n\nCovid-19 vaccination urgently needed, speed is key\n\nIn the same statement, PPK Malaysia said it appreciates shopping malls for recognising the need to subsidise the Covid-19 vaccination costs for retail frontliners, in order to protect the retail industry through immunisation and as an overall corporate social responsibility (CSR) contribution towards the national agenda of urgently achieving herd immunity.\n\n\u201cIt has been proven in several overseas countries that the speed of vaccinations is the way to bring down the rate of infections, coupled with self-discipline and strict adherence to SOPs instead of prolonging the need for further MCOs,\u201d it said, referring to the movement control orders (MCO) in the country.\n\nNoting that the Covid-19 vaccination for the public is being planned on a different schedule, the association said the primary purpose for the partnership with the government was to vaccinate all employees of shopping malls and malls\u2019 business outlets, adding that it is believed that the malls would be \u201cmuch safer places for the public to shop with confidence and with peace of mind\u201d once such vaccination is carried out.\n\n\u201cDespite our good intentions, we are distraught with the negative comments in the media that malls are profiteering from this exercise which is extremely far from the truth,\u201d it said, adding that this statement was issued in order to correct and put the record straight.\n\nIt noted that the \u201curgent need for access to vaccination\u201d was reflected in the shopping malls\u2019 \u201centhusiastic participation\u201d and the \u201coverwhelming registration\u201d by mall employees and mall tenants for the proposed onsite Covid-19 vaccination at malls.\n\n\u201cWe truly look forward to the success of this win-win collaboration with the authorities towards the national objective of achieving herd immunity urgently and the ultimate recovery of the economy in due course,\u201d the association said.\n\nEarlier in the statement, PPK Malaysia explained the reasoning for the idea of vaccinating mall tenants\u2019 staff onsite at shopping malls, while also providing updates on the progress of this plan.\n\nCiting the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi\u2019s May 28 announcement of plans to vaccinate an estimated 500,000 employees in the retail industry under the country\u2019s economic frontliners (retail sector) Covid-19 immunisation programme, PPK Malaysia said it lauded the government\u2019s targeting of the relevant economic sectors to speed up the Covid-19 vaccination programme.\n\n\u201cShopping malls together with all retail tenants\u2019 staff are effectively frontliners and we feel that it is imperative for the vaccination exercise to be implemented expeditiously. When vaccinated, our frontliners will not only protect themselves but more importantly, duly protect the shoppers and the public.\n\n\u201cWe are also appreciative that our proposal for on-site vaccination centres at shopping malls is adopted as it is more efficient and logical to bring the medical personnel to come on-site to administer the vaccinations instead of all the staff having to take time off work to travel to outside vaccination centres, thus interrupting business and daily operations,\u201d PPK Malaysia said.\n\nIn the May 28 statement by the KPDNHEP minister, he too had spoken of his ministry\u2019s cooperation with the Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) for the vaccination of \u201ceconomic frontliners\u201d in the retail sector expected to start in June, and had also spoke on discussions involving CITF on the same day with 60 representatives from the retail industry.\n\nThe minister had also on May 28 spoken of his ministry\u2019s cooperation with PPK Malaysia, the Malaysia Retailers Association (MRA), and Malaysia Retail Chain Association (MRCA) to establish Covid-19 vaccination centres (PPVs) at strategic locations nationwide, while also urging all retail companies to join this vaccination programme to help achieve the government\u2019s target of vaccinating 80 per cent of the population before the year ends.\n\nToday, PPK Malaysia said such an initiative in collaboration with the authorities has received \u201centhusiastic response\u201d from its members malls and retailers, noting that more than 50 malls have already notified their interest to host PPVs nationwide.\n\n\u201cDetails of this programme and the confirmed locations are being finalised and will be announced, once approved in due course, and we do look forward to the rollout by end of June 2021 onwards as scheduled,\u201d it said, having noted that it had already had several meetings with the authorities on this public-private sector partnership for Covid-19 vaccination.\n\nAbout ProtectHealth Corporation\n\nOn its website, ProtectHealth Corporation Sdn Bhd states that the not-for-profit company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Health Ministry\u2019s ProtectHealth Malaysia. It further states that it was appointed by the ministry to implement the participation of private medical practitioners in the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme.\n\nBased on information on ProtectHealth\u2019s website, private general practitioners do not need to pay to participate in the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme, but would have to receive training and also prepare their own personal protective equipment.\n\nThe website also states that ProtectHealth would pay general practitioners RM14 for their administration of each dose of Covid-19 vaccines through clinic and community outreach models, while payment of RM45 per hour would be paid to them for Covid-19 vaccination under government-organised mass vaccination models.\n\nProtectHealth Corporation denied collecting payments from shopping centres purportedly rolling out Covid-19 inoculation drives with vaccinators from ProtectHealth Corp.\n\n\u201cProtectHealth involvement remains the same for all vaccination centres. We pay private medical practitioners RM14 per dose administered,\u201d Khairul Faizi from the corporate communications unit of ProtectHealth Corp told CodeBlue today.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t supply vaccines as our role is managing the private medical practitioners. The vaccine supply is done by the government, similar to other vaccination centres.\u201d\n\nHealth news portal CodeBlue yesterday reported ProtectHealth Corporation as stating its role as merely managing the private medical practitioners carrying out Covid-19 vaccination work and that it pays RM14 per dose administered to such private healthcare personnel.\n\nCodeBlue yesterday also reported ProtectHealth Corporation as denying collecting payments from shopping malls for Covid-19 vaccination in collaboration with the company. \u2013 MalayMail", "keyword": ["shopping", "fee",

a landmark decision, the Intellectual Property High Court in Kuala Lumpur has declared that the sale, offer for sale, distribution and/or supply of TV Boxes or illicit streaming devices (ISDs) that can provide unauthorised access to copyrighted works, constitutes copyright infringement under the Copyright Act 1987.\n\nThe action in the Intellectual Property High Court was brought by satellite operator Measat Broadcast Networks, the service provider for Malaysian pay-TV platform Astro, against a seller of ISDs preloaded with applications which act as gateways to websites or content servers streaming pirated content.\n\nThe historic judgment, considered to be the first by the Intellectual Property High Court, is positively received by the authorities and industry players in their battle against digital piracy. Industry leaders including Astro laud the High Court\u2019s judgement as a bold step in the right direction against piracy in Malaysia.\n\n\u201cThe declaration by the High Court that sale of ISD which allows access to unauthorised copyright content amounts to copyright infringement sets a precedent for future civil claims on copyright infringement against ISD sellers in the market, including those on e-commerce platforms,\u201d stated Laila Saat, Director, Regulatory of Astro. \u201cThis ground-breaking declaration will strengthen intellectual property protection in the country and ongoing anti-piracy efforts, which are pivotal to ensure continuous investment and job creation in Malaysia\u2019s media and entertainment industry. We will continue to work with authorities and content partners to send a strong message that content piracy is theft, illegal and punishable by law.\u201d\n\n\u201cMCMC welcomes the court\u2019s decision, this will strengthen the legal aspects in protecting copyright infringement and battle against piracy, especially in digital and networked forms,\u201d added Zulkarnain Mohd Yasin, Chief Regulatory Officer of the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC).\n\n\u201cAcknowledging that more proactive action is needed to fight digital piracy in the country, FINAS expresses full support for legal action taken by Astro against ISD sellers and all digital piracy activities as these illegal activities has caused the local creative industry a huge loss in revenue every year,\u201d commented Dr. Ahmad Idham Ahmad Nadzri, CEO of the National Film Development Corporation Malaysia (FINAS). \u201cIn driving more holistic and effective strategy battling digital piracy, FINAS has established the Digital Piracy Eradication Committee with the collective support and involvement of relevant law enforcement agencies to further empower and strengthen enforcement, regulations and the terms of distribution licences in line with the provisions under the FINAS Act 244 1981\u201d.\n\n\u201cMyIPO looks forward for cases concerning ISDs to be brought forward to the Malaysian court,\u201d said Zulkarnain Muhammad, Deputy Director General of the Intellectual Property Corporation of Malaysia (MyIPO). \u201cPrevalent and widespread use of ISDs cause far more economic harm than physical copyright piracy. These devices are part of a wider network of online copyright piracy, which will in the long run disincentive original creators from producing creative work. Copyright piracy in any form should be curbed and deterred.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision is the correct one and we welcome it whole-heartedly,\u201d declared Louis Boswell, CEO of the Asia Video Industry Association (AVIA). \u201cContent is not made for free, and it is the right of creators and distributors to charge for it. To circumvent this and steal it is theft, and I see little difference between the theft of physical goods and the theft of video streams. As a society we need to do more to recognise theft for what it is and this ruling is a strong step in that direction.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is an important and welcome declaration by the Intellectual Property High Court, and sends a clear message that the sale of ISDs that provide unauthorised access to copyrighted works constitutes copyright infringement,\u201d asserted Kevin Plumb, Premier League Director of Legal Services. \u201cThe Premier League is committed to pursuing all those involved with providing illegal access to Premier League content as well as working to raise awareness of the risks fans face when watching via unauthorised sources. We will continue to work with Astro and local authorities as part of our ongoing anti-piracy programme in Malaysia.\u201d\n\nThe estimated loss to the industry and Malaysian economy due to piracy is over RM3 billion (\u20ac590m) annually with RM500 million in taxes and thousands of jobs at risk.\n\nThe declaration by the High Court follows recent criminal cases successfully brought against ISD retailers. On February 8th, a company director of an IT company was charged at the Shah Alam Sessions Court under Section 41 (1) (ha) of the Copyright Act 1987 with promoting Long TV Android boxes which allow the bypassing of technological protection measures on copyright broadcast work. On February 16th, a woman director of a mobile accessory company pleaded guilty to a charge of possessing TV media boxes that contains software to illegally stream Astro\u2019s content via the Internet. She was fined RM30,000 under Section 232(2) of the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998, making her the first ISD seller to be charged under this provision.\n\nThe Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) reiterated that it will take stern action against suppliers and sellers who misuse devices and software to illegally access content protected by their copyright work

Court in Luak, Miri on last Friday as blatant abuse of power and inhumane by the police.\n\nAccording to Aidi, a team from the Miri district police station was sent to the premises at around 9.30am after they received a public tip-off that the stalls there were serving dine-in breakfast to customers.\n\n\u201cAt the premises, the team witnessed that one of the stall operator was in the midst of preparing dine-in dishes for her customers,\u201d said Aidi.\n\nThe team also reported that upon realising the presence of the police, a few of the customers quickly left the premises and a worker quickly cleared-up the table.\n\nAidi said the premises had violated the current SOP of \u2018no dining-in\u2019 as the tables and chairs appeared to have been arranged for dine-in purposes.\n\n\u201cInside the premises, a man was sitting alone at a table and ignored the presence of the police. He also refused to cooperate with the team when questioned,\u201d said Aidi, adding that police had no choice but to issue him a compound.\n\nHe said it was only after the issuance of compound that the man claimed that he was a stall operator and voiced out his dissatisfaction for being issued with a compound.\n\nAidi said the stall operator, who was eating at a table in the premises, had indirectly encouraged other customers to dine-in at the premises.\n\n\u201cFurther checks on the stall operator revealed that he only has a business licence and not a licence from the Miri City Council,\u201d Aidi added.\n\nTherefore, he said what Ling had claimed in his statement was utterly wrong as evidence could be found from the premises\u2019 closed-circuit television (CCTV).\n\n\u201cFrom this, there was no blatant abuse of power and inhumane act by the police as claimed by Ling,\u201d Aidi added.\n\nThe owner of the premise is also urged to handover a copy of the CCTV footage to the police for further investigation under the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Act 1988.\n\nMeanwhile, Aidi said the police are working together with the government in the fight to break the infection chain of the Covid-19 virus in Sarawak.\n\n\u201cThe infection rate of the virus in Sarawak is worrying and everyone is urged to abide to the SOP as set by the Malaysian National Security Council,\u201d he added.", "keyword": ["aidi", "dinein", "senator", "team", "claim", "sop", "abuse", "stall", "miri", "statement", "operator", "act", "premises", "denies", "power", "lings", "chief"], "summary": "\u201cAt the premises, the team witnessed that one of the stall operator was in the midst of preparing dine-in dishes for her customers,\u201d said Aidi.\nHe said it was only after the issuance of compound that the man claimed that he was a stall operator and voiced out his dissatisfaction for being issued with a compound.\nAidi said the stall operator, who was eating at a table in the premises, had indirectly encouraged other customers to dine-in at the premises.\n\u201cFurther checks on the stall operator revealed that he only has a business licence and not a licence from the Miri City Council,\u201d Aidi added.\n\u201cFrom this, there was no blatant abuse of power and inhumane act by the police as claimed by Ling,\u201d Aidi added.", "news": "The Borneo Post", "date": "2021-05-23 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "AZ Covid-19 vaccine registration for Sarawak now open for senior citizens in Kuching and Miri", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVib3JuZW9wb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA1LzIzL2F6LWNvdmlkLTE5LXZhY2NpbmUtcmVnaXN0cmF0aW9uLWZvci1zYXJhd2FrLW5vdy1vcGVuLWZvci1zZW5pb3ItY2l0aXplbnMtaW4ta3VjaGluZy1hbmQtbWlyaS_SAQA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2021/02/235341-01-02-WHO.jpg", "text": "KUCHING (May 23): The registration for the AstraZeneca (AZ) Covid-19 vaccine opt-in programme for Sarawak is now open for those aged 60 and above in Kuching and Miri.\n\nThose who sign-up are given the option of picking when they want to be vaccinated from June 7 to July 27.\n\nIn Kuching, the AZ vaccination is scheduled to take place at the Borneo Convention Centre Kuching and in Miri, the vaccination will be taking place at the National Youth Development Institute there.\n\nThis is the second round of the AZ opt-in programme in the country.

Could it be that PBS, just like Warisan, had also rejected Kitingan\u2019s overtures to officially join PN?\u201d he said in a statement today.\n\nKitingan, who heads STAR, a PN component party, had earlier today said he was open to the idea of opposition party Warisan joining the ruling coalition.\n\nThe Keningau MP said STAR was open to the idea and believed everybody should be invited into PN, including Warisan.\n\n\u201cThey have assemblymen who want to serve their constituencies. So, why not do this together?\n\n\u201cGRS is open (to the idea) and we have discussed it actually. Even the chief minister is open to it,\u201d Kitingan said.\n\nAlthough Warisan has rejected Kitingan\u2019s offer, the party has not, however, addressed the invitation initially made by PBS president Maximus Ongkili to join PN.\n\nOngkili had yesterday clarified remarks he made that he was willing to work with any opposition party, including Warisan.\n\nOngkili said his actual intention was to express PBS\u2019 openness to have Warisan cooperate with the state and federal governments to achieve their common development goals for the good of Sabah and Sabahans.\n\nIn his statement today, Siambun said Kitingan should realise that Warisan president Shafie Apdal\u2019s reply on his preference to work with PBS was merely a response to a question by a journalist on whether there had been any discussion with other parties on a potential partnership.\n\n\u201cShafie\u2019s preference to work with PBS was because it shares similar struggles for Sabahans as Warisan and that Ongkili is a long-time personal friend of Shafie and a consistent advocate on Sabah\u2019s rights as well.\n\n\u201cPBS is also a state-based party that had been consistent throughout these years since its formation and had been a victim of party-hopping,\u201d he said, referring to the fall of the PBS government after the state elections in 1994.\n\nSiambun also pointed out that the unique position held by PBS in the government allows it to determine the course and direction of the party without being dictated by others.\n\n\u201cPBS is not an official component member of Barisan Nasional or PN but only supports the government of the day. The support we give is contingent upon ensuring the Malaysia Agreement 1963 is wholly implemented.\n\n\u201cThis could be the reason why Ongkili was given the task to helm the Sabah and Sarawak affairs ministry in the Prime Minister\u2019s Department,\u201d he said.\n\nSiambun also said Warisan did not wish to be associated with PAS that had rejected a bill to amend Article 1(2) of the Federal Constitution.\n\nThe bill was intended to reinstate Sabah and Sarawak to their original status prior to a 1976 constitutional amendment.\n\nHe said Kitingan, whose STAR party is a formal member of PN, also worked closely with PAS, which had outrightly rejected the bill initiated by the late Liew Vui Keong, the former de facto law minister.\n\nHe said Kitingan should clarify why he is willing to work with PAS which has a nominated assemblyman in the Sabah state assembly now.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["open", "laughs", "party", "work", "warisan", "state", "pbs", "pn", "join", "invitation", "kitingan", "rejected", "jeffreys"], "summary": "KOTA KINABALU: State opposition party Warisan has declined an invitation by Perikatan Nasional deputy chairman Jeffrey Kitingan to join the ruling coalition, saying the invite was \u201chumorous\u201d.\nCould it be that PBS, just like Warisan, had also rejected Kitingan\u2019s overtures to officially join PN?\u201d he said in a statement today.\nKitingan, who heads STAR, a PN component party, had earlier today said he was open to the idea of opposition party Warisan joining the ruling coalition.\nThe Keningau MP said STAR was open to the idea and believed everybody should be invited into PN, including Warisan.\nAlthough Warisan has rejected Kitingan\u2019s offer, the party has not, however, addressed the invitation initially made by PBS president Maximus Ongkili to join PN.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-05-21 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "AirAsia\u2019s digital businesses to become Asean\u2019s leading super app", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWFsYXlzaWFucmVzZXJ2ZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNS8yOC9haXJhc2lhcy1kaWdpdGFsLWJ1c2luZXNzZXMtdG8tYmVjb21lLWFzZWFucy1sZWFkaW5nLXN1cGVyLWFwcC_SAW5odHRwczovL3RoZW1hbGF5c2lhbnJlc2VydmUuY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvMjgvYWlyYXNpYXMtZGlnaXRhbC1idXNpbmVzc2VzLXRvLWJlY29tZS1hc2VhbnMtbGVhZGluZy1zdXBlci1hcHAvYW1wLw?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://themalaysianreserve.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/AIRASIA-APP.jpg", "text": "By AZALEA AZUAR / Pic credit: airasia.com\n\nAirAsia Group Bhd\u2019s non-airline digital businesses is on the right track to becoming Asean\u2019s digital travel and lifestyle platform as it meets strong consumer demands.\n\nIts super app is now considered one of the region\u2019s top three online travel agencies (OTA) while AirAsia\u2019s e-wallet BigPay is set to become the first virtual bank and its delivery service Teleport is strengthening.\n\nDuring the group\u2019s first quarter of 2021 (1Q21) financial performance announcement on May 27, AirAsia super app posted a 45% year-on-year (YoY) increase in its revenue to RM10 million supported by solid growth of products and services available on the platform.\n\nTeleport\u2019s revenue has also tripled compared to its 1Q20 performance.\n\nAccording to AirAsia Group CEO Tan Sri Tony Fernandes, just as they revolutionised air travel 20 years ago with their low-cost carrier, AirAsia is now disrupting and democratising the lifestyle industry again through the development of their super app with over 17 travel and products leveraging off one another.\n\n\u201cIn just over a year we are now one of the top three leading online travel agencies (OTAs) in Asean based on website traffic, with over 100 million average page views monthly on airasia.com.\n\n\u201cIn the future, when travel resumes in our key markets, we can guarantee best value prices for our flight and hotel packages because we own our own airline,\u201d he explained in a press release today.\n\nExpansion of its popular products and services to its Asean markets for its super app is in AirAsia\u2019s pipeline.\n\n\u201cWe are working on expanding our health services in Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines, while offering SNAP hotel and accommodation deals in Vietnam and Singapore in the near future,\u201d said Fernandes.\n\nHe also said that Teleport not only provides the usual deliveries but has now been delivering vaccines all over Malaysia and the Asean region. Hence, it has created more than 4,000 delivery driver jobs in 17 key markets.\n\n\u201cWe are also looking forward to converting passenger planes into freighters in the coming months to cater for unprecedented cargo demand,\u201d he said.\n\nFernandes added that the group has plans to improve its BigPay e-wallet to become the best virtual bank in Asean.\n\n\u201cWe are tapping into the full potential of our loyalty platform BIG Rewards, to provide the best range for rewards and redemption in Asean and beyond.\n\n\u201cThrough our digital ecosystem, we have already created thousands of jobs and supported more than 3,500 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Malaysia.\n\n\u201cOur training centre, AirAsia Academy (currently known as Redbeat Academy), offers affordable digital and tech training courses to equip not only our own employees, but also SMEs and members of the public, with skills to bridge the technology gap in Malaysia and beyond in this ever changing digital world,\u201d he said.\n\nApart from AirAsia\u2019s digital services, its other non-airline businesses such as AirAsia Food, AirAsia Fresh, AirAsia Shop and its Santan franchise restaurants are also penetrating into new markets.\n\n\u201cAs we continue to expand our digital footprint in Malaysia and other Asean countries, our contribution in the region will only increase and become more significant from here onwards.\n\n\u201cWe saw the crisis as an opportunity to use the downtime in flying caused by the pandemic to leverage the strength of our database of over 60 million customers and to focus on developing new non airline revenue streams in the key areas of e-commerce, fintech and logistics,\u201d Fernandes commented.\n\nAirAsia has more innovations to roll out such as the ride-hailing \u201cAirAsia Ride\u201d, which will be launched in the coming months, as well as the potential of drone delivery.\n\nThe group is also planning for electric or hydronic aeroplanes to meet consumer\u2019s sustainability needs.\n\n\u201cIn the airline business, Asia Digital Engineering (ADE) is set to become one of the region\u2019s best value aircraft maintenance and overhaul providers for both short term line maintenance and longer-term base maintenance, a space previously dominated by Singapore-based maintenance and overhaul companies (MROs).\n\n\u201cI firmly believe ADE will become the leading aircraft maintenance/overhaul company in the region in the near future with significant potential growth opportunities in Asean and beyond with service excellence and the lowest cost base,\u201d he said.\n\nAirAsia is also working to launch more contactless technologies to make flying a seamless and hygienic experience when it resumes.\n\nThis includes a digital passport called Scan2Fly where passengers can upload required medical documentation and have it verified in real time online, before heading to the airport.\n\nThe group would also be introducing FACES, its biometric facial recognition technology at Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2 (KLIA 2) and it will be rolled out across all key destinations.\n\n\u201cThere is a silver lining to every crisis and the best thing to come out of this pandemic is our recovery as a stronger, more resilient travel and lifestyle platform \u2013 not solely reliant on airfares alone anymore,\u201d said Fernandes.\n\nThe \u201cnew look\u201d AirAsia would be embarking on an exciting new phase of growth, with the right focus and foundations to better meet the needs of the digital revolution.\n\nFernandes stressed that they would remain true to their promise of delivering high quality service serving the underserved by making it affordable to fly, stay, shop, eat and upskill.\n\n\u201cLooking out for the everyday people is what we do best and we aim to continue to support them, not only in the major cities, but also in the smaller cities we serve, where many

open and detailed revelation of an intrusion by China\u2019s air force has raised many questions that the government needs to answer, says an expert in defence and diplomacy matters.\n\n\u201cThe biggest question is how the government, in particular Wisma Putra, is going to resolve it?\u201d asked the expert, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nThe expert said, however, that the RMAF\u2019s \u201cextremely rare\u201d move to reveal details of the incident which saw its fighter jets being scrambled to intercept 16 People\u2019s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) planes in Malaysia\u2019s maritime zone (ZMM), provided a \u201cgolden opportunity\u201d for the country.\n\nThe source said while the possibility that the PLAAF was carrying out surveillance in the area could not be ruled out, the Chinese could also have been \u201ctesting the waters\u201d over Malaysia\u2019s air defence systems and its reaction.\n\nThe \u201cbreach of Malaysian airspace and sovereignty\u201d \u2013 as foreign affairs minister Hishammuddin Hussein termed it \u2013 by the Chinese aircraft is the latest in a series of actions by China in the disputed South China Sea that has its neighbours worried.\n\nFor years, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei, Taiwan and Vietnam have been contesting China\u2019s claim to almost all of the South China Sea. These countries have often protested against China over what they claimed were intrusions into their territories.\n\nIn recent years, the dispute over the sea has seen a rise in tensions not only between China and these nations but also between China and the US. As recent as May 20, China and the US exchanged strong words over US naval activity in the region.\n\nThe expert asked what the rules of engagement would have been had the Chinese planes not turned back when the RMAF scrambled its jets.\n\n\u201cTypically, when an air force is confronted with such a situation, they would fire a warning shot or resort to aggressive manoeuvres to \u2018force\u2019 the foreign planes to turn back. Were our Hawks armed for engagement? How many Hawks were deployed?\n\n\u201cMy question is why did we scramble our Hawk 208 fighters? Those are advanced trainer jets, light fighter jets. They do not have the same interception capabilities of our Sukhoi Su-30MKM or F/A-18 Hornets.\n\n\u201cAre they airworthy? Or were the Hawks deployed because they are closest to that part of the South China Sea? If so, why are we not stationing more advanced fighters closer to the region?\u201d\n\nHe commended Hishammuddin for saying Wisma Putra would summon the Chinese ambassador to explain the incident.\n\nThe Chinese, the expert said, had already said the flight by the 16 planes was routine training and that it had not entered any other country\u2019s territorial air space under international law.\n\n\u201cEssentially, the Chinese are saying they have done nothing wrong. But Wisma Putra wants an explanation on the breach of Malaysian airspace and sovereignty.\n\n\u201cSo who is telling the truth? And what happens next? Will China apologise? I doubt they will, given their stance on the South China Sea.\u201d\n\nThe expert said if Wisma Putra was not satisfied with China\u2019s explanation and if the country refused to apologise, Malaysia should take the \u201cbold\u201d step of expelling the Chinese ambassador and recalling the Malaysian ambassador in China.\n\n\u201cIn diplomatic lexicon, expelling an ambassador is a very serious statement. I think if we do not do so, we (Malaysia) run the risk of looking weak.\u201d\n\nStill, the expert said, the incident provided Malaysia with the \u201cgolden opportunity\u201d to analyse and address defence issues, including the placement of frontline fighter jets and pattern of violations by foreign forces, particularly in the hotly disputed South China Sea.\n\nMeanwhile, defence analyst Lam Choong Wah said Asean and China were currently negotiating a code of conduct (CoC) for the South China Sea and that these negotiations needed to be sped up to regulate the behaviour of military operations in the region.\n\n\u201cMalaysia should utilise all available diplomatic channels to handle the issue to preserve national interests,\u201d Lam said.\n\n\u201cBeing firm or soft is not the crux of the problem. The core issue is there is no CoC in place to regulate military behavior in disputed areas, and until there is a CoC, military or maritime enforcement standoffs will take place from time to time.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["expert", "force", "wisma", "planes", "south", "malaysian", "chinese", "jets", "chinas", "intrusion", "putrajaya", "resolve", "sea", "putra"], "summary": "\u201cThe biggest question is how the government, in particular Wisma Putra, is going to resolve it?\u201d asked the expert, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.\nFor years, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei, Taiwan and Vietnam have been contesting China\u2019s claim to almost all of the South China Sea.\nThe expert asked what the rules of engagement would have been had the Chinese planes not turned back when the RMAF scrambled its jets.\n\u201cTypically, when an air force is confronted with such a situation, they would fire a warning shot or resort to aggressive manoeuvres to \u2018force\u2019 the foreign planes to turn back.\nBut Wisma Putra wants an explanation on the breach of Malaysian airspace and sovereignty.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-06-03 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Take more from KWAN to help M40, B40 groups, says Najib", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wNi8wMi90YWtlLW1vcmUtZnJvbS1rd2FuLXRvLWhlbHAtbTQwLWI0MC1ncm91cHMtc2F5cy1uYWppYi_SAQA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Fmt Reporters"], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/02-PANIC-BUYING-MC0-3.0.jpg", "text": "PETALING JAYA: Former prime minister Najib Razak has urged the government to take another RM4.2 billion from the National Trust Fund (KWAN) to assist the (bottom 40) B40 and (middle 40) M40 groups during the total lockdown.\n\nIn a Facebook post, he assured that Barisan Nasional would replenish the funds in the future.\n\nNajib also questioned if the current allocation of RM100 each for single Malaysians and RM500 for each B40 household with at least three children was sufficient.\n\n\u201cOn top of that, this assistance comes after they have faced MCO 2.0 and MCO 3.0/3.1 for five months, and now the total lockdown,\u201d he said.\n\nNajib noted that the payments would only come in by the end of June, while the additional RM500 for the Prihatin Special Grant (GKP) recipients was due in July.\n\nHe added that GKP recipients should also be eligible for Bantuan Prihatin Rakyat, as they had the additional burden of bearing the losses faced by their businesses.\n\nNajib said the Perikatan Nasional administration could dip into KWAN again if it wished to avoid borrowing more money, since it had already borrowed over RM100 billion for BPR aid within the first five months of the year.\n\nWith the additional funds from KWAN, Najib said, more could be handed out under the Bantuan Prihatin aid scheme.\n\n\u201cThe RM300 to RM500 will become RM900 to RM1,500 for B40 families.

It\u2019s sad at first, but whatever happened, happened and it\u2019s best to move on and be strong,\u201d said the 33-year-old content creator from Selangor, when we spoke on Sunday (30 May).\n\nFahmi had been confirmed positive with Covid-19 after getting tested at the Covid Assessment Centre (CAC) in Stadium Melawati, Shah Alam on 21 May. That same day, he was sent straight to the PKRC to undergo more than a week of mandatory quarantine.\n\n\u201cI have three days to go. They count it from the day you first did your swab test and 10 days after that.\u201d he explained, mentioning how all of his close contacts were fortunate enough to have not contracted the virus.\n\nSharing his experiences, Fahmi revealed how his body had reacted over the course of his infection.\n\nMy symptoms came in pretty late, each day one symptom. First came the sore throat, fever the day after, then I started to lose my sense of smell and taste, then I started to feel heavy breathing and panting. But nothing serious. That\u2019s why they sent me to MAEPS because here they have the equipment to scan my lungs.\n\nFahmi also said that the medical staff stationed at the PKRC had been very reliable and responsive to his needs and everyone else who\u2019s there.\n\nQuarantine life\n\nWith thousands of other Covid-19 patients confined together at the \u2018DG Hall\u2019 in MAEPS, Fahmi noted his shock when first arriving at the PKRC and said that quarantine life took some getting used to.\n\n\u201cI was of course surprised by the insane number of people here, to the point that there are not enough beds. People have to sleep on mattresses on the floor,\u201d he said, adding that without any appropriate shower facility there, patients also have to contend with long bathroom lines and having to bathe on the toilet.\n\nHowever, despite the minor discomforts, Fahmi said everything at the PKRC had been satisfactory and personally relates life in quarantine to what people might find in boarding schools.\n\n\u201cFood is served three times a day. Breakfast is at 8 am, lunch at 12 noon and dinner at 6 pm. I wake up in the morning to queue for breakfast, queue for showers, and once I\u2019m done I just hang out with the friends I\u2019ve made.\u201d Fahmi gushed, revealing that there really isn\u2019t much to do in quarantine besides interacting with other patients who are there.\n\nIn good company\n\nFahmi also shared how the companionship he made in quarantine helped ease the time spent away from his loved ones.\n\nTogether, he and his newly-found friend shared meals and feels, took leisurely walks, played video games and even prayed together, shoulder to shoulder.\n\nLife in quarantine.\n\n(Credit: Fahmi Esmail)\n\nPeople here are nice, they\u2019re happy and are very friendly to each other. We have bunk-bed mates and neighbours that we share food and snacks that we brought from home.\n\nFahmi also emphasised the importance of making connections and keeping in touch with people in order to power through the coronavirus.\n\nThey\u2019re just normal people, someone that we can talk to, share what we do and laugh with. The key to surviving here is to just make friends to keep yourself sane.\n\nWith the time spent living with a deadly disease and after having been in the Covid-19 isolation camp, Fahmi said that the best way to overcome it all is with positive thinking and not giving up.\n\nI was scared, anything could happen and I was afraid I wasn\u2019t going to come back. But eventually, I try to show people that I am actually okay here and I\u2019m trying to change the perception people have of quarantine at MAEPS.\n\nWith Covid-19 outbreaks continuing nationwide, Fahmi has this to say to the people \u201con the outside\u201d who haven\u2019t yet experienced the challenges of living with Covid-19.\n\nI will say that it\u2019s not a joke and not something that can be taken trivially.

Initially, it sold only one brand, but has now expanded to a variety of premium UK and Europe brands.\n\nQueenspree CEO and co-founder Abdul Rahman Md Din said for the first quarter of 2021, the company has expanded in terms of technology, including developing a same-day delivery processing system and improving its data analysis capabilities.\n\n\u201cCapital injections from this second round will allow us to drive Queenspree to the next phase, strengthen our lead in Malaysia and expand our presence to Singapore and Brunei,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite operating digitally, Queenspree remains focused on giving a personal touch and dedicated customer service. So far, Queenspree has successfully trained a total of eight customer service officers who are actively interacting with customers through all of their digital platforms.\n\nThrough this approach, customers will get prompt technical advice and assistance on product suitability, directions of use, care tips and colour and payment options.\n\nQueenspree.com is able to simulate the cost of the delivery based on its distance and customers have the liberty to choose their preferred delivery slots upon checkout.\n\nQueenspree CFO and co-founder Rafiza Abd Hamid said they are proud of the trust given by the community of kitchen product enthusiasts.\n\n\u201cTo date, we have nearly 100,000 people throughout our social media platforms and websites.

Let\u2019s find out.\n\nThe phone looks pretty good on the back too, so when you\u2019re taking pictures of other people at least they\u2019ll be looking towards you. (Credit: TRP)\n\nA phone catered to selfie enthusiasts\n\nAs advertised by the company, the V21\u2019s main selling point has to be its selfie camera with tonnes of options for you to play with such as adjusting brightness all the way, to toning your cheeks.\n\nAnd apparently, having nifty software tricks is not enough for the Chinese manufacturer as the phone is also fitted with \u2013 wait for it \u2013 two built-in flashlights which the company calls Dual Selfie Spotlight located on the front of the phone.\n\nYou know, just in case you\u2019re in a really, really, dark room and thought that this might be the best time to take a selfie.\n\nCredit: TRP\n\nThe V21 can even guide you on how to take a good selfie \u2013 complete with outlines showing you how to pose and take the shot.\n\nThe back camera is pretty good too if you\u2019re under good sunlight and it has three different lenses for you to choose from.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good in the hand and it\u2019s pretty too\n\nAlthough this phone has a screen size of 6.44 inches, the phone actually feels good in the hand and isn\u2019t super huge thanks to a design that stretches the panel out to the edge of the phone.\n\nIf you\u2019re a bit conservative and want your phone to blend in the background, there\u2019s the Dusk Blue colour option, but if you want it to get everyone\u2019s attention including your own, there\u2019s also Sunset Dazzle which is a real looker.\n\nThe colours on the body of the phone shift when you look at it from different angles which might entice some folks who want their phone to have a slightly funkier colour palette rather than having it just plain old black or white.\n\nCredit: TRP\n\nAll day phone\n\nThe Vivo V21 has quite a slim profile but don\u2019t think that it\u2019s not beefed up in the battery department because the phone can last you a full day even if you\u2019re consuming a lot of content.\n\nThere\u2019s also the option of fast charging if you manage to drain that big battery and they\u2019re not messing about. It\u2019s actually possible to get this thing from 0 to roughly above 50% within half an hour.\n\nCredit: TRP\n\nNot really a gaming phone\n\nThe phone might tick many boxes but gaming is not one of them.\n\nYes, you can play graphic intensive games like COD Mobile or PUBG Mobile, but I noticed that the V21 doesn\u2019t allow you to max out the settings, which might be a dealbreaker for some but if you\u2019re playing casual games, it will work just fine.\n\nShould you get the V21?\n\nIt\u2019s a great phone if you\u2019re someone who likes to take a lot of selfies as this where the phone truly shines. Literally.\n\nThere are not many phones that can say that they have one, let alone two flashes for the front camera and the amount of options is great for those who want to tweak their selfies.\n\nApart from the front camera, the V21 is also capable in other areas such as having a great screen for watching stuff like YouTube or Netflix, a pretty design, and also a large battery with the option of fast charging that borders on ridiculous.\n\nThe Vivo V21 is an affordable package and that not only looks good, but it feels good to use too.\n\nCredit: TRP\n\nShare your thoughts with us via TRP\u2019s Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.", "keyword": ["really", "youre", "camera", "phone", "good", "v21", "pretty", "taking", "having", "selfies", "vivo", "selfie", "review", "option"], "summary": "Vivo recently came out with the V21, a phone that takes aim at those who like to take a lot of selfies.\nBut, is a selfie camera really enough to entice you to get this phone?\nThe phone looks pretty good on the back too, so when you\u2019re taking pictures of other people at least they\u2019ll be looking towards you.\nYou know, just in case you\u2019re in a really, really, dark room and thought that this might be the best time to take a selfie.\nIt\u2019s a great phone if you\u2019re someone who likes to take a lot of selfies as this where the phone truly shines.", "news": "The Rakyat Post", "date": "2021-06-02 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "We need to prepare for the worst, says health DG", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wNS8yNS93ZS1uZWVkLXRvLXByZXBhcmUtZm9yLXRoZS13b3JzdC1zYXlzLWhlYWx0aC1kZy_SAQA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/noor-hisham-abdullah-fmt-080521-2.jpg", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: Health director-general Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah urged the public to prepare for the worst in facing the Covid-19 wave following an exponential trend indicated by the Covid-19 graph in this country.\n\n\u201cThe rise in cases started from April 1 and could trigger a vertical surge.

Earlier today, we were told that Perodua\u2019s Sentral facility in Section 19, Petaling Jaya remained closed, including its after-sales department. According to a source, the company is expected to make an announcement on the matter soon.\n\nLikewise, Edaran Tan Chong Motor (ETCM) announced yesterday via a FB post that all Nissan workshops are temporarily closed, pending application for operation. The company has not yet updated the status of its after-sales activities as of this point.\n\nMeanwhile, Honda dealerships that have obtained approval for after-sales service to continue have begun doing so.

All businesses will have to comply with tight standard operating procedures (SOPs) and all local authority directives.\n\nCar sales have of course stopped during the two-week period, as well as that for vehicle inspections and registrations, as both Puspakom and the road transport department (JPJ) have announced that no business will be done during the lockdown.

According to the statement released by the ministry yesterday, customers can only stay in retail stores or shopping malls for a maximum duration of two hours once the new directive is put in place tomorrow.\n\nSo, who will be responsible for monitoring this time limit? Based on another document that was released earlier today, the responsibility falls on the retail store and shopping mall operators themselves.

A brutal new wave of the Covid-19 epidemic killed a record high 1,290 people last month.\n\nPPK Malaysia\u2019s circular stated that a total of RM30 per person will be charged as administration fee (RM15 per dose) and another RM20 per person for logistic expenditure (RM10 per dose). The RM30 fee for two doses is supposedly paid to ProtectHealth Corporation, a company owned by the Ministry of Health (MOH) that manages private medical practitioners who sign up as vaccinators under PICK.\n\nCodeBlue contacted PPK Malaysia \u2014 which represents major shopping centres in the Klang Valley and other states \u2014 to verify the authenticity of the circular. A representative from PPK Malaysia said: \u201cYes, we sent the circular. We want to vaccinate the staff to make shopping malls a safer place.\u201d\n\nPPK Malaysia\u2019s circular stated that their coronavirus vaccination programme will be conducted together with the Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) under the Science, Technology and Innovation Ministry (MOSTI) and the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP).\n\n\u201cAs mentioned panel doctors and medical personnel, for example nurses registered under ProtectHealth Corporation (PHC) will administer the vaccinations and malls will need to pay RM15 per dose to PHC,\u201d PPK Malaysia president Teo Chiang Kok said in his May 29 circular to the association\u2019s members.\n\n\u201cAs each course requires two rounds of vaccination, the total cost to be paid to PHC will be RM30 per pax which we will strongly encourage malls to undertake for their own employees.\u201d\n\nHowever, ProtectHealth Corporation denied collecting payments from shopping centres purportedly rolling out Covid-19 inoculation drives with vaccinators from ProtectHealth Corp.\n\n\u201cProtectHealth involvement remains the same for all vaccination centres. We pay private medical practitioners RM14 per dose administered,\u201d Khairul Faizi from the corporate communications unit of ProtectHealth Corp told CodeBlue today.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t supply vaccines as our role is managing the private medical practitioners. The vaccine supply is done by the government, similar to other vaccination centres.\u201d\n\nKPDNHEP corporate communications unit head Yunus Tasim firmly denied collecting money from any party for the shopping centres\u2019 Covid-19 vaccination programmes.\n\n\u201cWe are finding ways to vaccinate the economic frontliners in the country who are in constant interaction with consumers,\u201d Yunus told CodeBlue.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t collect money from anyone for the vaccines. The vaccines are from the government and it is free of charge,\u201d he added.\n\nMalls like Suria KLCC, KL Gateway, Bangsar Village, Aeon, and Damansara Uptown Two have already informed tenants on their Covid-19 vaccination programmes, charging RM50 per vaccine recipient.\n\nKPDNHEP previously announced last May 28 that the \u201cEconomic Frontliners Vaccination Programme\u201d for the retail sector will begin this month, covering more than 500,000 retail workers.\n\nNonetheless, CITF has yet to announce the launch date of this inoculation programme, nor explained whether it would involve charging vaccine recipients or their employers. The source of the Covid-19 vaccine supply for retail workers or other \u201ceconomic frontliners\u201d was not mentioned by any involved stakeholders.\n\nMOSTI did not respond to CodeBlue\u2019s requests for clarification at the time of writing.\n\nVaccine Minister Khairy Jamaluddin said earlier today that the government would begin to vaccinate workers in industries and economic sectors that must remain open during the Movement Control Order (MCO).

ProtectHealth Corporation \u2013 a Ministry of Health (MOH) owned company whose board includes the Health director-general and MOH secretary-general \u2013 and the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) \u2013 which appears to oversee the so-called \u201ceconomic frontliners vaccination programme\u201d for the retail sector \u2013 have denied collecting payments for the vaccine rollouts by shopping centres.\n\nSo, what are shopping centres collecting the money for? If ProtectHealth is already covering the cost of vaccine administration by paying vaccinators RM14 per dose administered, is the RM50 fee to cover the cost of venue rental for setting up vaccination centres (PPVs) at malls? Even then, this seems excessive.\n\nPharmaniaga Bhd, on the other hand, is expected to immediately deliver Sinovac\u2019s coronavirus vaccines to state governments and the private sector, despite Vaccine Minister Khairy Jamaluddin\u2019s previous assertion that the federal government\u2019s order of 12 million doses must be fulfilled in its entirety \u2013 estimated end July \u2013 before Pharmaniaga begins work on other orders.\n\nWith Health Minister Dr Adham Baba and Senior Defence Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob\u2019s latest statement yesterday (Pharmaniaga is controlled by the Armed Forces Fund Board) on Pharmaniaga\u2019s vaccine distribution to states and companies running parallel with PICK, it is unclear if Pharmaniaga can fully deliver the federal government\u2019s order by the end-July target.\n\nWhy is CITF diverting Covid-19 vaccines away from PICK when we have inoculated just a fraction of the 9.4 million targeted individuals who face the highest risk of developing severe disease or dying from Covid-19 \u2013 the elderly, people with comorbidities, and the disabled community?\n\nAs of May 31, just about two million people have received at least one dose of the vaccine. Assuming that about a million of these individuals are frontline workers from the first phase of PICK and young adults who signed up for the AstraZeneca-Oxford jab (numbers are likely higher), that means Malaysia has vaccinated only a million high-risk individuals, or 11 per cent of the 9.4 million targeted.\n\nCITF has yet to publish statistics on the number of high-risk people who have received Covid-19 vaccines so far.\n\nIn the month of May alone, 1,290 people lost their lives to Covid-19 in Malaysia, nearly triple the 471 fatalities recorded in the whole of last year. Although an increasing number of younger adults are dying from Covid-19 in the new wave of the Malaysian epidemic, the elderly remain the primary victims.\n\nAbout 74 per cent of 1,290 people who died from Covid-19 last month, or 955 individuals, were aged 60 years and above. Nearly nine in 10 victims had underlying health conditions, 75 per cent of whom were aged 60 or older.\n\nDozens of people have been dying from Covid-19 every day in Malaysia in the past three weeks. When hospitals and intensive care units (ICUs) are full, our vaccination strategy should focus on reducing the number of people with Covid-19 requiring hospital or critical care, not to cut infections.\n\nPeople who receive vaccination can still contract Covid-19 and possibly infect others, but all approved coronavirus vaccines prevent severe disease and death.\n\nChasing illusory single-digit daily infections \u2013 or even triple-digit infections at this point \u2013 is an impossible endeavour that will take at least six months or even a year, depending on how fast we can inoculate two-thirds of our adult population. As of yesterday, only about 8 per cent of Malaysia\u2019s adult population has received at least one dose.\n\nIf CITF is now changing its vaccination strategy to focus on working adults to prevent further economically devastating lockdowns, then CITF should make this clear. In a scenario with limited resources \u2013 vaccine supply, manpower to run PPVs, and outreach efforts \u2013 there must be priority groups in whichever strategy, whether it\u2019s to protect the most vulnerable or to keep the economy going.\n\nThe UK recorded zero new Covid-19 deaths yesterday for the first time since July 2020. This achievement came after the UK took about six months to vaccinate nearly 75 per cent of the adult population, or over 39 million people, with at least one vaccine dose.\n\nThe UK\u2019s coronavirus vaccination programme, which opened up in phases according to age, hit its target of offering a first jab to all those in top priority groups \u2013 those aged 50 or older as well as people in high-risk categories \u2013 before April 15.\n\nEngland and Scotland have now started offering first vaccines to people aged 30 and above, while Northern Ireland and Wales have begun vaccinating over-18s. Due to the emergence of the variant first discovered in India, renamed the \u201cDelta\u201d variant, England is accelerating second vaccine doses to adults aged 50 and above.\n\nThe UK has the benefit of most residents, including non-nationals, being registered with its NHS, making it easy to reach out to senior citizens for Covid-19 vaccination. Malaysia, on the other hand, has serious challenges in providing vaccine access to the elderly, many of whom live in the community with their families or on their own instead of care homes.\n\nThe over 62,000 no-shows at Covid-19 vaccination appointments in Kedah, Pahang, Kelantan, Perak, Negeri Sembilan, Melaka, Perlis, and Terengganu \u2013 attributed to lack of transport to PPVs and not checking the MySejahtera app for appointment dates \u2013 illustrate the immense difficulty in reaching the elderly population.\n\nBut this does not mean the government should abandon senior citizens and switch focus to easier targets.

Covid-19 vaccinations onsite at shopping malls for participating retail tenants is not profiteering, the Malaysia Shopping Malls Association (PPK Malaysia) said today.\n\nInstead, the association representing shopping malls claimed that the actual estimated cost for logistics and the health personnel needed to administer the Covid-19 vaccines could go up to RM100 and even RM150, and that the malls had actually decided to subsidise the cost with plans to only collect RM50.\n\nPPK Malaysia was speaking of the plans to have onsite Covid-19 vaccination at shopping malls for employees of retail outlets in the malls, through a \u201cpublic-private sector partnership\u201d model.\n\nWhile confirming that the Covid-19 vaccines will be provided by the Malaysian government for free under this partnership PPK Malaysia said shopping malls will be paying for the fees for doctors, nurses and medical officers to Health Ministry-owned ProtectHealth Corporation and all other antecedent costs.\n\nEarlier this week, notices had circulated on social media of purported plans by shopping malls to offer Covid-19 vaccination to retail tenants\u2019 staff at RM50 per person for two doses (with some giving a breakdown of RM15 for administration per dose and RM10 for logistics per dose).\n\nPPK Malaysia said the planned collection of RM50 was meant partly to secure commitment by retail staff to ensure that they would show up for the vaccination, as well as to pay for the services of administering the Covid-19 vaccine to be provided by the private healthcare providers coordinated by ProtectHealth Corporation.\n\n\u201cOur Association members estimated that the cost of providing the venue, logistics, manpower, standby ambulance service etc for the on-site vaccination centre will amount to RM100 to RM150 per pax, depending on volume and total number of doses available each day, the total population to be vaccinated and the duration to complete all the doses.\n\n\u201cIn the interests of the national agenda, it was decided that the malls shall largely subsidise these costs and be allowed to charge merely RM10 x 2 doses = RM20 per pax to partially defray their expenses and as a commitment by the registrant so as to mitigate absenteeism, leading to wastage of vaccines which would otherwise could be administered to those yet to be scheduled and in order to reach herd immunity of the community in the shortest possible time.\n\n\u201cWe were also informed that the doctors and nurses providing their service will be allocated by the Protect Health Corporation who will charge to administer per dose at RM15.\n\n\u201cTherefore, at RM15 per dose x 2 doses equalling RM30, plus the above nominal sum of RM20 to partially defray logistic expenses, a total of RM50 for 2 doses will be charged to participants, principally only our shopping frontliners,\u201d the shopping malls association explained in a statement today.\n\nCovid-19 vaccination urgently needed, speed is key\n\nIn the same statement, PPK Malaysia said it appreciates shopping malls for recognising the need to subsidise the Covid-19 vaccination costs for retail frontliners, in order to protect the retail industry through immunisation and as an overall corporate social responsibility (CSR) contribution towards the national agenda of urgently achieving herd immunity.\n\n\u201cIt has been proven in several overseas countries that the speed of vaccinations is the way to bring down the rate of infections, coupled with self-discipline and strict adherence to SOPs instead of prolonging the need for further MCOs,\u201d it said, referring to the movement control orders (MCO) in the country.\n\nNoting that the Covid-19 vaccination for the public is being planned on a different schedule, the association said the primary purpose for the partnership with the government was to vaccinate all employees of shopping malls and malls\u2019 business outlets, adding that it is believed that the malls would be \u201cmuch safer places for the public to shop with confidence and with peace of mind\u201d once such vaccination is carried out.\n\n\u201cDespite our good intentions, we are distraught with the negative comments in the media that malls are profiteering from this exercise which is extremely far from the truth,\u201d it said, adding that this statement was issued in order to correct and put the record straight.\n\nIt noted that the \u201curgent need for access to vaccination\u201d was reflected in the shopping malls\u2019 \u201centhusiastic participation\u201d and the \u201coverwhelming registration\u201d by mall employees and mall tenants for the proposed onsite Covid-19 vaccination at malls.\n\n\u201cWe truly look forward to the success of this win-win collaboration with the authorities towards the national objective of achieving herd immunity urgently and the ultimate recovery of the economy in due course,\u201d the association said.\n\nEarlier in the statement, PPK Malaysia explained the reasoning for the idea of vaccinating mall tenants\u2019 staff onsite at shopping malls, while also providing updates on the progress of this plan.\n\nCiting the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi\u2019s May 28 announcement of plans to vaccinate an estimated 500,000 employees in the retail industry under the country\u2019s economic frontliners (retail sector) Covid-19 immunisation programme, PPK Malaysia said it lauded the government\u2019s targeting of the relevant economic sectors to speed up the Covid-19 vaccination programme.\n\n\u201cShopping malls together with all retail tenants\u2019 staff are effectively frontliners and we feel that it is imperative for the vaccination exercise to be implemented expeditiously. When vaccinated, our frontliners will not only protect themselves but more importantly, duly protect the shoppers and the public.\n\n\u201cWe are also appreciative that our proposal for on-site vaccination centres at shopping malls is adopted as it is more efficient and logical to bring the medical personnel to come on-site to administer the vaccinations instead of all the staff having to take time off work to travel to outside vaccination centres, thus interrupting business and daily operations,\u201d PPK Malaysia said.\n\nIn the May 28 statement by the KPDNHEP minister, he too had spoken of his ministry\u2019s cooperation with the Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) for the vaccination of \u201ceconomic frontliners\u201d in the retail sector expected to start in June, and had also spoke on discussions involving CITF on the same day with 60 representatives from the retail industry.\n\nThe minister had also on May 28 spoken of his ministry\u2019s cooperation with PPK Malaysia, the Malaysia Retailers Association (MRA), and Malaysia Retail Chain Association (MRCA) to establish Covid-19 vaccination centres (PPVs) at strategic locations nationwide, while also urging all retail companies to join this vaccination programme to help achieve the government\u2019s target of vaccinating 80 per cent of the population before the year ends.\n\nToday, PPK Malaysia said such an initiative in collaboration with the authorities has received \u201centhusiastic response\u201d from its members malls and retailers, noting that more than 50 malls have already notified their interest to host PPVs nationwide.\n\n\u201cDetails of this programme and the confirmed locations are being finalised and will be announced, once approved in due course, and we do look forward to the rollout by end of June 2021 onwards as scheduled,\u201d it said, having noted that it had already had several meetings with the authorities on this public-private sector partnership for Covid-19 vaccination.\n\nAbout ProtectHealth Corporation\n\nOn its website, ProtectHealth Corporation Sdn Bhd states that the not-for-profit company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Health Ministry\u2019s ProtectHealth Malaysia. It further states that it was appointed by the ministry to implement the participation of private medical practitioners in the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme.\n\nBased on information on ProtectHealth\u2019s website, private general practitioners do not need to pay to participate in the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme, but would have to receive training and also prepare their own personal protective equipment.\n\nThe website also states that ProtectHealth would pay general practitioners RM14 for their administration of each dose of Covid-19 vaccines through clinic and community outreach models, while payment of RM45 per hour would be paid to them for Covid-19 vaccination under government-organised mass vaccination models.\n\nProtectHealth Corporation denied collecting payments from shopping centres purportedly rolling out Covid-19 inoculation drives with vaccinators from ProtectHealth Corp.\n\n\u201cProtectHealth involvement remains the same for all vaccination centres. We pay private medical practitioners RM14 per dose administered,\u201d Khairul Faizi from the corporate communications unit of ProtectHealth Corp told CodeBlue today.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t supply vaccines as our role is managing the private medical practitioners. The vaccine supply is done by the government, similar to other vaccination centres.\u201d\n\nHealth news portal CodeBlue yesterday reported ProtectHealth Corporation as stating its role as merely managing the private medical practitioners carrying out Covid-19 vaccination work and that it pays RM14 per dose administered to such private healthcare personnel.\n\nCodeBlue yesterday also reported ProtectHealth Corporation as denying collecting payments from shopping malls for Covid-19 vaccination in collaboration with the company. \u2013 MalayMail", "keyword": ["shopping", "fee",

a landmark decision, the Intellectual Property High Court in Kuala Lumpur has declared that the sale, offer for sale, distribution and/or supply of TV Boxes or illicit streaming devices (ISDs) that can provide unauthorised access to copyrighted works, constitutes copyright infringement under the Copyright Act 1987.\n\nThe action in the Intellectual Property High Court was brought by satellite operator Measat Broadcast Networks, the service provider for Malaysian pay-TV platform Astro, against a seller of ISDs preloaded with applications which act as gateways to websites or content servers streaming pirated content.\n\nThe historic judgment, considered to be the first by the Intellectual Property High Court, is positively received by the authorities and industry players in their battle against digital piracy. Industry leaders including Astro laud the High Court\u2019s judgement as a bold step in the right direction against piracy in Malaysia.\n\n\u201cThe declaration by the High Court that sale of ISD which allows access to unauthorised copyright content amounts to copyright infringement sets a precedent for future civil claims on copyright infringement against ISD sellers in the market, including those on e-commerce platforms,\u201d stated Laila Saat, Director, Regulatory of Astro. \u201cThis ground-breaking declaration will strengthen intellectual property protection in the country and ongoing anti-piracy efforts, which are pivotal to ensure continuous investment and job creation in Malaysia\u2019s media and entertainment industry. We will continue to work with authorities and content partners to send a strong message that content piracy is theft, illegal and punishable by law.\u201d\n\n\u201cMCMC welcomes the court\u2019s decision, this will strengthen the legal aspects in protecting copyright infringement and battle against piracy, especially in digital and networked forms,\u201d added Zulkarnain Mohd Yasin, Chief Regulatory Officer of the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC).\n\n\u201cAcknowledging that more proactive action is needed to fight digital piracy in the country, FINAS expresses full support for legal action taken by Astro against ISD sellers and all digital piracy activities as these illegal activities has caused the local creative industry a huge loss in revenue every year,\u201d commented Dr. Ahmad Idham Ahmad Nadzri, CEO of the National Film Development Corporation Malaysia (FINAS). \u201cIn driving more holistic and effective strategy battling digital piracy, FINAS has established the Digital Piracy Eradication Committee with the collective support and involvement of relevant law enforcement agencies to further empower and strengthen enforcement, regulations and the terms of distribution licences in line with the provisions under the FINAS Act 244 1981\u201d.\n\n\u201cMyIPO looks forward for cases concerning ISDs to be brought forward to the Malaysian court,\u201d said Zulkarnain Muhammad, Deputy Director General of the Intellectual Property Corporation of Malaysia (MyIPO). \u201cPrevalent and widespread use of ISDs cause far more economic harm than physical copyright piracy. These devices are part of a wider network of online copyright piracy, which will in the long run disincentive original creators from producing creative work. Copyright piracy in any form should be curbed and deterred.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision is the correct one and we welcome it whole-heartedly,\u201d declared Louis Boswell, CEO of the Asia Video Industry Association (AVIA). \u201cContent is not made for free, and it is the right of creators and distributors to charge for it. To circumvent this and steal it is theft, and I see little difference between the theft of physical goods and the theft of video streams. As a society we need to do more to recognise theft for what it is and this ruling is a strong step in that direction.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is an important and welcome declaration by the Intellectual Property High Court, and sends a clear message that the sale of ISDs that provide unauthorised access to copyrighted works constitutes copyright infringement,\u201d asserted Kevin Plumb, Premier League Director of Legal Services. \u201cThe Premier League is committed to pursuing all those involved with providing illegal access to Premier League content as well as working to raise awareness of the risks fans face when watching via unauthorised sources. We will continue to work with Astro and local authorities as part of our ongoing anti-piracy programme in Malaysia.\u201d\n\nThe estimated loss to the industry and Malaysian economy due to piracy is over RM3 billion (\u20ac590m) annually with RM500 million in taxes and thousands of jobs at risk.\n\nThe declaration by the High Court follows recent criminal cases successfully brought against ISD retailers. On February 8th, a company director of an IT company was charged at the Shah Alam Sessions Court under Section 41 (1) (ha) of the Copyright Act 1987 with promoting Long TV Android boxes which allow the bypassing of technological protection measures on copyright broadcast work. On February 16th, a woman director of a mobile accessory company pleaded guilty to a charge of possessing TV media boxes that contains software to illegally stream Astro\u2019s content via the Internet. She was fined RM30,000 under Section 232(2) of the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998, making her the first ISD seller to be charged under this provision.\n\nThe Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) reiterated that it will take stern action against suppliers and sellers who misuse devices and software to illegally access content protected by their copyright work

Court in Luak, Miri on last Friday as blatant abuse of power and inhumane by the police.\n\nAccording to Aidi, a team from the Miri district police station was sent to the premises at around 9.30am after they received a public tip-off that the stalls there were serving dine-in breakfast to customers.\n\n\u201cAt the premises, the team witnessed that one of the stall operator was in the midst of preparing dine-in dishes for her customers,\u201d said Aidi.\n\nThe team also reported that upon realising the presence of the police, a few of the customers quickly left the premises and a worker quickly cleared-up the table.\n\nAidi said the premises had violated the current SOP of \u2018no dining-in\u2019 as the tables and chairs appeared to have been arranged for dine-in purposes.\n\n\u201cInside the premises, a man was sitting alone at a table and ignored the presence of the police. He also refused to cooperate with the team when questioned,\u201d said Aidi, adding that police had no choice but to issue him a compound.\n\nHe said it was only after the issuance of compound that the man claimed that he was a stall operator and voiced out his dissatisfaction for being issued with a compound.\n\nAidi said the stall operator, who was eating at a table in the premises, had indirectly encouraged other customers to dine-in at the premises.\n\n\u201cFurther checks on the stall operator revealed that he only has a business licence and not a licence from the Miri City Council,\u201d Aidi added.\n\nTherefore, he said what Ling had claimed in his statement was utterly wrong as evidence could be found from the premises\u2019 closed-circuit television (CCTV).\n\n\u201cFrom this, there was no blatant abuse of power and inhumane act by the police as claimed by Ling,\u201d Aidi added.\n\nThe owner of the premise is also urged to handover a copy of the CCTV footage to the police for further investigation under the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Act 1988.\n\nMeanwhile, Aidi said the police are working together with the government in the fight to break the infection chain of the Covid-19 virus in Sarawak.\n\n\u201cThe infection rate of the virus in Sarawak is worrying and everyone is urged to abide to the SOP as set by the Malaysian National Security Council,\u201d he added.", "keyword": ["aidi", "dinein", "senator", "team", "claim", "sop", "abuse", "stall", "miri", "statement", "operator", "act", "premises", "denies", "power", "lings", "chief"], "summary": "\u201cAt the premises, the team witnessed that one of the stall operator was in the midst of preparing dine-in dishes for her customers,\u201d said Aidi.\nHe said it was only after the issuance of compound that the man claimed that he was a stall operator and voiced out his dissatisfaction for being issued with a compound.\nAidi said the stall operator, who was eating at a table in the premises, had indirectly encouraged other customers to dine-in at the premises.\n\u201cFurther checks on the stall operator revealed that he only has a business licence and not a licence from the Miri City Council,\u201d Aidi added.\n\u201cFrom this, there was no blatant abuse of power and inhumane act by the police as claimed by Ling,\u201d Aidi added.", "news": "The Borneo Post", "date": "2021-05-23 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Lead example, Lo tells politicians in curbing Covid-19 pandemic", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWJvcm5lb3Bvc3QuY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvMjIvbGVhZC1leGFtcGxlLWxvLXRlbGxzLXBvbGl0aWNpYW5zLWluLWN1cmJpbmctY292aWQtMTktcGFuZGVtaWMv0gEA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2019/04/Andrew-Lo.jpeg", "text": "KUCHING (May 22): The Malaysian Trade Union Congress (MTUC) Sarawak has demanded for leadership by example in efforts to flatten the Covid-19 pandemic curve in the country.\n\nIts secretary Andrew Lo said until and unless the national and state political leaders step up and demonstrate leadership by example, Malaysia, including Sarawak, will not see an end to the Covid-19 pandemic any time soon.\n\nHe said MTUC Sarawak was quite amused by the Prime Minister\u2019s announcement that the National Security Council will tighten enforcement of the Movement Control Order (MCO) 3.0.\n\nThe Prime Minister, he noted, had inadvertently admitted that there had been loose enforcement the past 15 months.\n\n\u201cMTUC certainly does not condone any non-compliance of the standard operating procedures (SOP) and MCO.\n\n\u201cHowever we must question the many cases of Ministers and very important peoples (VIPs) that appears not to follow these restrictions and got off with a slap of the wrist, at most.\n\n\u201cWe even have Minister that was out of the country for weeks.

Could it be that PBS, just like Warisan, had also rejected Kitingan\u2019s overtures to officially join PN?\u201d he said in a statement today.\n\nKitingan, who heads STAR, a PN component party, had earlier today said he was open to the idea of opposition party Warisan joining the ruling coalition.\n\nThe Keningau MP said STAR was open to the idea and believed everybody should be invited into PN, including Warisan.\n\n\u201cThey have assemblymen who want to serve their constituencies. So, why not do this together?\n\n\u201cGRS is open (to the idea) and we have discussed it actually. Even the chief minister is open to it,\u201d Kitingan said.\n\nAlthough Warisan has rejected Kitingan\u2019s offer, the party has not, however, addressed the invitation initially made by PBS president Maximus Ongkili to join PN.\n\nOngkili had yesterday clarified remarks he made that he was willing to work with any opposition party, including Warisan.\n\nOngkili said his actual intention was to express PBS\u2019 openness to have Warisan cooperate with the state and federal governments to achieve their common development goals for the good of Sabah and Sabahans.\n\nIn his statement today, Siambun said Kitingan should realise that Warisan president Shafie Apdal\u2019s reply on his preference to work with PBS was merely a response to a question by a journalist on whether there had been any discussion with other parties on a potential partnership.\n\n\u201cShafie\u2019s preference to work with PBS was because it shares similar struggles for Sabahans as Warisan and that Ongkili is a long-time personal friend of Shafie and a consistent advocate on Sabah\u2019s rights as well.\n\n\u201cPBS is also a state-based party that had been consistent throughout these years since its formation and had been a victim of party-hopping,\u201d he said, referring to the fall of the PBS government after the state elections in 1994.\n\nSiambun also pointed out that the unique position held by PBS in the government allows it to determine the course and direction of the party without being dictated by others.\n\n\u201cPBS is not an official component member of Barisan Nasional or PN but only supports the government of the day. The support we give is contingent upon ensuring the Malaysia Agreement 1963 is wholly implemented.\n\n\u201cThis could be the reason why Ongkili was given the task to helm the Sabah and Sarawak affairs ministry in the Prime Minister\u2019s Department,\u201d he said.\n\nSiambun also said Warisan did not wish to be associated with PAS that had rejected a bill to amend Article 1(2) of the Federal Constitution.\n\nThe bill was intended to reinstate Sabah and Sarawak to their original status prior to a 1976 constitutional amendment.\n\nHe said Kitingan, whose STAR party is a formal member of PN, also worked closely with PAS, which had outrightly rejected the bill initiated by the late Liew Vui Keong, the former de facto law minister.\n\nHe said Kitingan should clarify why he is willing to work with PAS which has a nominated assemblyman in the Sabah state assembly now.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["open", "laughs", "party", "work", "warisan", "state", "pbs", "pn", "join", "invitation", "kitingan", "rejected", "jeffreys"], "summary": "KOTA KINABALU: State opposition party Warisan has declined an invitation by Perikatan Nasional deputy chairman Jeffrey Kitingan to join the ruling coalition, saying the invite was \u201chumorous\u201d.\nCould it be that PBS, just like Warisan, had also rejected Kitingan\u2019s overtures to officially join PN?\u201d he said in a statement today.\nKitingan, who heads STAR, a PN component party, had earlier today said he was open to the idea of opposition party Warisan joining the ruling coalition.\nThe Keningau MP said STAR was open to the idea and believed everybody should be invited into PN, including Warisan.\nAlthough Warisan has rejected Kitingan\u2019s offer, the party has not, however, addressed the invitation initially made by PBS president Maximus Ongkili to join PN.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-05-21 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "AirAsia\u2019s digital businesses to become Asean\u2019s leading super app", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWFsYXlzaWFucmVzZXJ2ZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNS8yOC9haXJhc2lhcy1kaWdpdGFsLWJ1c2luZXNzZXMtdG8tYmVjb21lLWFzZWFucy1sZWFkaW5nLXN1cGVyLWFwcC_SAW5odHRwczovL3RoZW1hbGF5c2lhbnJlc2VydmUuY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvMjgvYWlyYXNpYXMtZGlnaXRhbC1idXNpbmVzc2VzLXRvLWJlY29tZS1hc2VhbnMtbGVhZGluZy1zdXBlci1hcHAvYW1wLw?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://themalaysianreserve.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/AIRASIA-APP.jpg", "text": "By AZALEA AZUAR / Pic credit: airasia.com\n\nAirAsia Group Bhd\u2019s non-airline digital businesses is on the right track to becoming Asean\u2019s digital travel and lifestyle platform as it meets strong consumer demands.\n\nIts super app is now considered one of the region\u2019s top three online travel agencies (OTA) while AirAsia\u2019s e-wallet BigPay is set to become the first virtual bank and its delivery service Teleport is strengthening.\n\nDuring the group\u2019s first quarter of 2021 (1Q21) financial performance announcement on May 27, AirAsia super app posted a 45% year-on-year (YoY) increase in its revenue to RM10 million supported by solid growth of products and services available on the platform.\n\nTeleport\u2019s revenue has also tripled compared to its 1Q20 performance.\n\nAccording to AirAsia Group CEO Tan Sri Tony Fernandes, just as they revolutionised air travel 20 years ago with their low-cost carrier, AirAsia is now disrupting and democratising the lifestyle industry again through the development of their super app with over 17 travel and products leveraging off one another.\n\n\u201cIn just over a year we are now one of the top three leading online travel agencies (OTAs) in Asean based on website traffic, with over 100 million average page views monthly on airasia.com.\n\n\u201cIn the future, when travel resumes in our key markets, we can guarantee best value prices for our flight and hotel packages because we own our own airline,\u201d he explained in a press release today.\n\nExpansion of its popular products and services to its Asean markets for its super app is in AirAsia\u2019s pipeline.\n\n\u201cWe are working on expanding our health services in Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines, while offering SNAP hotel and accommodation deals in Vietnam and Singapore in the near future,\u201d said Fernandes.\n\nHe also said that Teleport not only provides the usual deliveries but has now been delivering vaccines all over Malaysia and the Asean region. Hence, it has created more than 4,000 delivery driver jobs in 17 key markets.\n\n\u201cWe are also looking forward to converting passenger planes into freighters in the coming months to cater for unprecedented cargo demand,\u201d he said.\n\nFernandes added that the group has plans to improve its BigPay e-wallet to become the best virtual bank in Asean.\n\n\u201cWe are tapping into the full potential of our loyalty platform BIG Rewards, to provide the best range for rewards and redemption in Asean and beyond.\n\n\u201cThrough our digital ecosystem, we have already created thousands of jobs and supported more than 3,500 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Malaysia.\n\n\u201cOur training centre, AirAsia Academy (currently known as Redbeat Academy), offers affordable digital and tech training courses to equip not only our own employees, but also SMEs and members of the public, with skills to bridge the technology gap in Malaysia and beyond in this ever changing digital world,\u201d he said.\n\nApart from AirAsia\u2019s digital services, its other non-airline businesses such as AirAsia Food, AirAsia Fresh, AirAsia Shop and its Santan franchise restaurants are also penetrating into new markets.\n\n\u201cAs we continue to expand our digital footprint in Malaysia and other Asean countries, our contribution in the region will only increase and become more significant from here onwards.\n\n\u201cWe saw the crisis as an opportunity to use the downtime in flying caused by the pandemic to leverage the strength of our database of over 60 million customers and to focus on developing new non airline revenue streams in the key areas of e-commerce, fintech and logistics,\u201d Fernandes commented.\n\nAirAsia has more innovations to roll out such as the ride-hailing \u201cAirAsia Ride\u201d, which will be launched in the coming months, as well as the potential of drone delivery.\n\nThe group is also planning for electric or hydronic aeroplanes to meet consumer\u2019s sustainability needs.\n\n\u201cIn the airline business, Asia Digital Engineering (ADE) is set to become one of the region\u2019s best value aircraft maintenance and overhaul providers for both short term line maintenance and longer-term base maintenance, a space previously dominated by Singapore-based maintenance and overhaul companies (MROs).\n\n\u201cI firmly believe ADE will become the leading aircraft maintenance/overhaul company in the region in the near future with significant potential growth opportunities in Asean and beyond with service excellence and the lowest cost base,\u201d he said.\n\nAirAsia is also working to launch more contactless technologies to make flying a seamless and hygienic experience when it resumes.\n\nThis includes a digital passport called Scan2Fly where passengers can upload required medical documentation and have it verified in real time online, before heading to the airport.\n\nThe group would also be introducing FACES, its biometric facial recognition technology at Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2 (KLIA 2) and it will be rolled out across all key destinations.\n\n\u201cThere is a silver lining to every crisis and the best thing to come out of this pandemic is our recovery as a stronger, more resilient travel and lifestyle platform \u2013 not solely reliant on airfares alone anymore,\u201d said Fernandes.\n\nThe \u201cnew look\u201d AirAsia would be embarking on an exciting new phase of growth, with the right focus and foundations to better meet the needs of the digital revolution.\n\nFernandes stressed that they would remain true to their promise of delivering high quality service serving the underserved by making it affordable to fly, stay, shop, eat and upskill.\n\n\u201cLooking out for the everyday people is what we do best and we aim to continue to support them, not only in the major cities, but also in the smaller cities we serve, where many people are struggling the most and access to products and services are more limited.\u201d", "keyword": ["asean", "maintenance", "aseans", "travel", "services", "super", "app", "airasias", "airasia",

open and detailed revelation of an intrusion by China\u2019s air force has raised many questions that the government needs to answer, says an expert in defence and diplomacy matters.\n\n\u201cThe biggest question is how the government, in particular Wisma Putra, is going to resolve it?\u201d asked the expert, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nThe expert said, however, that the RMAF\u2019s \u201cextremely rare\u201d move to reveal details of the incident which saw its fighter jets being scrambled to intercept 16 People\u2019s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) planes in Malaysia\u2019s maritime zone (ZMM), provided a \u201cgolden opportunity\u201d for the country.\n\nThe source said while the possibility that the PLAAF was carrying out surveillance in the area could not be ruled out, the Chinese could also have been \u201ctesting the waters\u201d over Malaysia\u2019s air defence systems and its reaction.\n\nThe \u201cbreach of Malaysian airspace and sovereignty\u201d \u2013 as foreign affairs minister Hishammuddin Hussein termed it \u2013 by the Chinese aircraft is the latest in a series of actions by China in the disputed South China Sea that has its neighbours worried.\n\nFor years, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei, Taiwan and Vietnam have been contesting China\u2019s claim to almost all of the South China Sea. These countries have often protested against China over what they claimed were intrusions into their territories.\n\nIn recent years, the dispute over the sea has seen a rise in tensions not only between China and these nations but also between China and the US. As recent as May 20, China and the US exchanged strong words over US naval activity in the region.\n\nThe expert asked what the rules of engagement would have been had the Chinese planes not turned back when the RMAF scrambled its jets.\n\n\u201cTypically, when an air force is confronted with such a situation, they would fire a warning shot or resort to aggressive manoeuvres to \u2018force\u2019 the foreign planes to turn back. Were our Hawks armed for engagement? How many Hawks were deployed?\n\n\u201cMy question is why did we scramble our Hawk 208 fighters? Those are advanced trainer jets, light fighter jets. They do not have the same interception capabilities of our Sukhoi Su-30MKM or F/A-18 Hornets.\n\n\u201cAre they airworthy? Or were the Hawks deployed because they are closest to that part of the South China Sea? If so, why are we not stationing more advanced fighters closer to the region?\u201d\n\nHe commended Hishammuddin for saying Wisma Putra would summon the Chinese ambassador to explain the incident.\n\nThe Chinese, the expert said, had already said the flight by the 16 planes was routine training and that it had not entered any other country\u2019s territorial air space under international law.\n\n\u201cEssentially, the Chinese are saying they have done nothing wrong. But Wisma Putra wants an explanation on the breach of Malaysian airspace and sovereignty.\n\n\u201cSo who is telling the truth? And what happens next? Will China apologise? I doubt they will, given their stance on the South China Sea.\u201d\n\nThe expert said if Wisma Putra was not satisfied with China\u2019s explanation and if the country refused to apologise, Malaysia should take the \u201cbold\u201d step of expelling the Chinese ambassador and recalling the Malaysian ambassador in China.\n\n\u201cIn diplomatic lexicon, expelling an ambassador is a very serious statement. I think if we do not do so, we (Malaysia) run the risk of looking weak.\u201d\n\nStill, the expert said, the incident provided Malaysia with the \u201cgolden opportunity\u201d to analyse and address defence issues, including the placement of frontline fighter jets and pattern of violations by foreign forces, particularly in the hotly disputed South China Sea.\n\nMeanwhile, defence analyst Lam Choong Wah said Asean and China were currently negotiating a code of conduct (CoC) for the South China Sea and that these negotiations needed to be sped up to regulate the behaviour of military operations in the region.\n\n\u201cMalaysia should utilise all available diplomatic channels to handle the issue to preserve national interests,\u201d Lam said.\n\n\u201cBeing firm or soft is not the crux of the problem. The core issue is there is no CoC in place to regulate military behavior in disputed areas, and until there is a CoC, military or maritime enforcement standoffs will take place from time to time.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["expert", "force", "wisma", "planes", "south", "malaysian", "chinese", "jets", "chinas", "intrusion", "putrajaya", "resolve", "sea", "putra"], "summary": "\u201cThe biggest question is how the government, in particular Wisma Putra, is going to resolve it?\u201d asked the expert, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.\nFor years, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei, Taiwan and Vietnam have been contesting China\u2019s claim to almost all of the South China Sea.\nThe expert asked what the rules of engagement would have been had the Chinese planes not turned back when the RMAF scrambled its jets.\n\u201cTypically, when an air force is confronted with such a situation, they would fire a warning shot or resort to aggressive manoeuvres to \u2018force\u2019 the foreign planes to turn back.\nBut Wisma Putra wants an explanation on the breach of Malaysian airspace and sovereignty.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-06-03 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Take more from KWAN to help M40, B40 groups, says Najib", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wNi8wMi90YWtlLW1vcmUtZnJvbS1rd2FuLXRvLWhlbHAtbTQwLWI0MC1ncm91cHMtc2F5cy1uYWppYi_SAQA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Fmt Reporters"], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/02-PANIC-BUYING-MC0-3.0.jpg", "text": "PETALING JAYA: Former prime minister Najib Razak has urged the government to take another RM4.2 billion from the National Trust Fund (KWAN) to assist the (bottom 40) B40 and (middle 40) M40 groups during the total lockdown.\n\nIn a Facebook post, he assured that Barisan Nasional would replenish the funds in the future.\n\nNajib also questioned if the current allocation of RM100 each for single Malaysians and RM500 for each B40 household with at least three children was sufficient.\n\n\u201cOn top of that, this assistance comes after they have faced MCO 2.0 and MCO 3.0/3.1 for five months, and now the total lockdown,\u201d he said.\n\nNajib noted that the payments would only come in by the end of June, while the additional RM500 for the Prihatin Special Grant (GKP) recipients was due in July.\n\nHe added that GKP recipients should also be eligible for Bantuan Prihatin Rakyat, as they had the additional burden of bearing the losses faced by their businesses.\n\nNajib said the Perikatan Nasional administration could dip into KWAN again if it wished to avoid borrowing more money, since it had already borrowed over RM100 billion for BPR aid within the first five months of the year.\n\nWith the additional funds from KWAN, Najib said, more could be handed out under the Bantuan Prihatin aid scheme.\n\n\u201cThe RM300 to RM500 will become RM900 to RM1,500 for B40 families.

It\u2019s sad at first, but whatever happened, happened and it\u2019s best to move on and be strong,\u201d said the 33-year-old content creator from Selangor, when we spoke on Sunday (30 May).\n\nFahmi had been confirmed positive with Covid-19 after getting tested at the Covid Assessment Centre (CAC) in Stadium Melawati, Shah Alam on 21 May. That same day, he was sent straight to the PKRC to undergo more than a week of mandatory quarantine.\n\n\u201cI have three days to go. They count it from the day you first did your swab test and 10 days after that.\u201d he explained, mentioning how all of his close contacts were fortunate enough to have not contracted the virus.\n\nSharing his experiences, Fahmi revealed how his body had reacted over the course of his infection.\n\nMy symptoms came in pretty late, each day one symptom. First came the sore throat, fever the day after, then I started to lose my sense of smell and taste, then I started to feel heavy breathing and panting. But nothing serious. That\u2019s why they sent me to MAEPS because here they have the equipment to scan my lungs.\n\nFahmi also said that the medical staff stationed at the PKRC had been very reliable and responsive to his needs and everyone else who\u2019s there.\n\nQuarantine life\n\nWith thousands of other Covid-19 patients confined together at the \u2018DG Hall\u2019 in MAEPS, Fahmi noted his shock when first arriving at the PKRC and said that quarantine life took some getting used to.\n\n\u201cI was of course surprised by the insane number of people here, to the point that there are not enough beds. People have to sleep on mattresses on the floor,\u201d he said, adding that without any appropriate shower facility there, patients also have to contend with long bathroom lines and having to bathe on the toilet.\n\nHowever, despite the minor discomforts, Fahmi said everything at the PKRC had been satisfactory and personally relates life in quarantine to what people might find in boarding schools.\n\n\u201cFood is served three times a day. Breakfast is at 8 am, lunch at 12 noon and dinner at 6 pm.

The key to surviving here is to just make friends to keep yourself sane.\n\nWith the time spent living with a deadly disease and after having been in the Covid-19 isolation camp, Fahmi said that the best way to overcome it all is with positive thinking and not giving up.\n\nI was scared, anything could happen and I was afraid I wasn\u2019t going to come back.

Let\u2019s find out.\n\nThe phone looks pretty good on the back too, so when you\u2019re taking pictures of other people at least they\u2019ll be looking towards you. (Credit: TRP)\n\nA phone catered to selfie enthusiasts\n\nAs advertised by the company, the V21\u2019s main selling point has to be its selfie camera with tonnes of options for you to play with such as adjusting brightness all the way, to toning your cheeks.\n\nAnd apparently, having nifty software tricks is not enough for the Chinese manufacturer as the phone is also fitted with \u2013 wait for it \u2013 two built-in flashlights which the company calls Dual Selfie Spotlight located on the front of the phone.\n\nYou know, just in case you\u2019re in a really, really, dark room and thought that this might be the best time to take a selfie.\n\nCredit: TRP\n\nThe V21 can even guide you on how to take a good selfie \u2013 complete with outlines showing you how to pose and take the shot.\n\nThe back camera is pretty good too if you\u2019re under good sunlight and it has three different lenses for you to choose from.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good in the hand and it\u2019s pretty too\n\nAlthough this phone has a screen size of 6.44 inches, the phone actually feels good in the hand and isn\u2019t super huge thanks to a design that stretches the panel out to the edge of the phone.\n\nIf you\u2019re a bit conservative and want your phone to blend in the background, there\u2019s the Dusk Blue colour option, but if you want it to get everyone\u2019s attention including your own, there\u2019s also Sunset Dazzle which is a real looker.\n\nThe colours on the body of the phone shift when you look at it from different angles which might entice some folks who want their phone to have a slightly funkier colour palette rather than having it just plain old black or white.\n\nCredit: TRP\n\nAll day phone\n\nThe Vivo V21 has quite a slim profile but don\u2019t think that it\u2019s not beefed up in the battery department because the phone can last you a full day even if you\u2019re consuming a lot of content.\n\nThere\u2019s also the option of fast charging if you manage to drain that big battery and they\u2019re not messing about. It\u2019s actually possible to get this thing from 0 to roughly above 50% within half an hour.\n\nCredit: TRP\n\nNot really a gaming phone\n\nThe phone might tick many boxes but gaming is not one of them.\n\nYes, you can play graphic intensive games like COD Mobile or PUBG Mobile, but I noticed that the V21 doesn\u2019t allow you to max out the settings, which might be a dealbreaker for some but if you\u2019re playing casual games, it will work just fine.\n\nShould you get the V21?\n\nIt\u2019s a great phone if you\u2019re someone who likes to take a lot of selfies as this where the phone truly shines. Literally.\n\nThere are not many phones that can say that they have one, let alone two flashes for the front camera and the amount of options is great for those who want to tweak their selfies.\n\nApart from the front camera, the V21 is also capable in other areas such as having a great screen for watching stuff like YouTube or Netflix, a pretty design, and also a large battery with the option of fast charging that borders on ridiculous.\n\nThe Vivo V21 is an affordable package and that not only looks good, but it feels good to use too.\n\nCredit: TRP\n\nShare your thoughts with us via TRP\u2019s Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.", "keyword": ["really", "youre", "camera", "phone", "good", "v21", "pretty", "taking", "having", "selfies", "vivo", "selfie", "review", "option"], "summary": "Vivo recently came out with the V21, a phone that takes aim at those who like to take a lot of selfies.\nBut, is a selfie camera really enough to entice you to get this phone?\nThe phone looks pretty good on the back too, so when you\u2019re taking pictures of other people at least they\u2019ll be looking towards you.\nYou know, just in case you\u2019re in a really, really, dark room and thought that this might be the best time to take a selfie.\nIt\u2019s a great phone if you\u2019re someone who likes to take a lot of selfies as this where the phone truly shines.", "news": "The Rakyat Post", "date": "2021-06-02 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "We need to prepare for the worst, says health DG", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wNS8yNS93ZS1uZWVkLXRvLXByZXBhcmUtZm9yLXRoZS13b3JzdC1zYXlzLWhlYWx0aC1kZy_SAQA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/noor-hisham-abdullah-fmt-080521-2.jpg", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: Health director-general Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah urged the public to prepare for the worst in facing the Covid-19 wave following an exponential trend indicated by the Covid-19 graph in this country.\n\n\u201cThe rise in cases started from April 1 and could trigger a vertical surge.

assured the people of Kapit, Song, Bukit Mabong, and Belaga districts that there are sufficient supplies of essential food items throughout this Gawai Dayak season.\n\nThe ministry\u2019s Kapit chief Al-Redzamani Abdul Razak said 10 items have been listed under the Festive Season Maximum Price Control Scheme (SHMMP) for Gawai until June 3.\n\nThey are live chicken, standard chicken (slaughtered and cleaned with legs, heads, liver and giblets or any part thereof), super chicken (slaughtered and cleaned, without legs, head, liver and giblets), Grade A chicken eggs (weighing between 65g and 69.9g), Grade B chicken eggs (weighing between 60g and 64.9g each), Grade C chicken eggs (weighing between 55g and 59.9g each), live old chicken, chicken wings, pork (belly), and pork (meat and fat).\n\n\u201cBased on our regular inspection and also the feedback from both retailers and suppliers, the supply level is stable and should be sufficient to meet the demands.\n\n\u201cNonetheless, our KPDNHEP teams continue to closely supervise and monitor the selling and buying trends during the current Movement Control Order (MCO) period, as well as to ensure every trader comply strictly with the price-control scheme for Gawai 2021.\n\n\u201cWe aim to advocate a healthy business environment and a win-win situation between the traders and the consumers,\u201d Al Redzamani said in a statement.\n\nHe also warned stern action would await any trader caught raising the price of any of the controlled items during the SHMMP Gawai 2021 period.\n\n\u201cAny consumer who finds any trader not abiding by the scheme, or notices other unscrupulous trading practices, can lodge a report by calling our hotline 1-800-886-800, or send WhatsApp texts via 019-2794317.\n\n\u201cAlso, seek KPDNHEP on Facebook, or go to Kapit KPDNHEP Office behind Meligai Hotel, which is open from 8am to 5pm on every regular working day,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, a survey here yesterday showed many shoppers stocking up not only for the Gawai Dayak celebration, but also for the the statewide MCO, which takes effect today.\n\nThe Terasang Market, Pasar Tani Kapit, Kapit Night Street Market, cold storage, and various supermarkets were crowded with more customers than usual.\n\nA local resident, who wish to be identified only as \u2018Madam Chen\u2019, said her husband reminded her to buy extra vegetables and meat for their family\u2019s consumption over the next few days.\n\n\u201cI bought various green vegetables, some pork, and also fish \u2013- these should last us for the next few days.\n\n\u201cWe, the adults, do not mind much, but the children are the ones who need more food to grow,\u201d the housewife from Jalan Selirik said when met at Terasang Market yesterday.\n\nPenghulu Allan Tubam said he had spent most of his time at his longhouse throughout the various stages of MCO.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t come down to Kapit town, unless there\u2019s some urgent or official duties that have to be attended to.\n\n\u201cI believe in looking after myself and my family as much as possible. I want to protect them from Covid-19. As a community leader, I need to set a good example for my followers,\u201d he said, adding that he and other community leaders had come to get their Covid-19 vaccination.\n\n\u201cThis morning (yesterday), I took the opportunity to buy some extra food, some drinks before returning to my longhouse.\n\n\u201cWith the MCO taking effect on May 29, I wouldn\u2019t do any Gawai shopping.

Earlier today, we were told that Perodua\u2019s Sentral facility in Section 19, Petaling Jaya remained closed, including its after-sales department. According to a source, the company is expected to make an announcement on the matter soon.\n\nLikewise, Edaran Tan Chong Motor (ETCM) announced yesterday via a FB post that all Nissan workshops are temporarily closed, pending application for operation. The company has not yet updated the status of its after-sales activities as of this point.\n\nMeanwhile, Honda dealerships that have obtained approval for after-sales service to continue have begun doing so. However, we were told by a source that not all Honda service centres are operational at this point, although more dealerships are attempting to get approval to operate their SCs. Honda Malaysia had previously announced that it would continue offering after-sales services during the lockdown period.\n\nThis is also the case with workshops and parts businesses, as approval by authorities is needed to open for business. Relevant documents are also necessary to ensure staff meet the necessary travel protocols. With enforcement being reportedly strict, many businesses allowed to operate during the FMCO are choosing to remain closed until they can obtain the necessary approval letters.\n\nEarlier, domestic trade and consumer affairs (KPDNHEP) minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi had stated that service centres as well as vehicle repair (body and paint) facilities would be allowed to operate during the lockdown, at 60% worker capacity. All businesses will have to comply with tight standard operating procedures (SOPs) and all local authority directives.\n\nCar sales have of course stopped during the two-week period, as well as that for vehicle inspections and registrations, as both Puspakom and the road transport department (JPJ) have announced that no business will be done during the lockdown.

According to the statement released by the ministry yesterday, customers can only stay in retail stores or shopping malls for a maximum duration of two hours once the new directive is put in place tomorrow.\n\nSo, who will be responsible for monitoring this time limit? Based on another document that was released earlier today, the responsibility falls on the retail store and shopping mall operators themselves.

A brutal new wave of the Covid-19 epidemic killed a record high 1,290 people last month.\n\nPPK Malaysia\u2019s circular stated that a total of RM30 per person will be charged as administration fee (RM15 per dose) and another RM20 per person for logistic expenditure (RM10 per dose). The RM30 fee for two doses is supposedly paid to ProtectHealth Corporation, a company owned by the Ministry of Health (MOH) that manages private medical practitioners who sign up as vaccinators under PICK.\n\nCodeBlue contacted PPK Malaysia \u2014 which represents major shopping centres in the Klang Valley and other states \u2014 to verify the authenticity of the circular.

We pay private medical practitioners RM14 per dose administered,\u201d Khairul Faizi from the corporate communications unit of ProtectHealth Corp told CodeBlue today.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t supply vaccines as our role is managing the private medical practitioners.

ProtectHealth Corporation \u2013 a Ministry of Health (MOH) owned company whose board includes the Health director-general and MOH secretary-general \u2013 and the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) \u2013 which appears to oversee the so-called \u201ceconomic frontliners vaccination programme\u201d for the retail sector \u2013 have denied collecting payments for the vaccine rollouts by shopping centres.\n\nSo, what are shopping centres collecting the money for? If ProtectHealth is already covering the cost of vaccine administration by paying vaccinators RM14 per dose administered, is the RM50 fee to cover the cost of venue rental for setting up vaccination centres (PPVs) at malls? Even then, this seems excessive.\n\nPharmaniaga Bhd, on the other hand, is expected to immediately deliver Sinovac\u2019s coronavirus vaccines to state governments and the private sector, despite Vaccine Minister Khairy Jamaluddin\u2019s previous assertion that the federal government\u2019s order of 12 million doses must be fulfilled in its entirety \u2013 estimated end July \u2013 before Pharmaniaga begins work on other orders.\n\nWith Health Minister Dr Adham Baba and Senior Defence Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob\u2019s latest statement yesterday (Pharmaniaga is controlled by the Armed Forces Fund Board) on Pharmaniaga\u2019s vaccine distribution to states and companies running parallel with PICK, it is unclear if Pharmaniaga can fully deliver the federal government\u2019s order by the end-July target.\n\nWhy is CITF diverting Covid-19 vaccines away from PICK when we have inoculated just a fraction of the 9.4 million targeted individuals who face the highest risk of developing severe disease or dying from Covid-19 \u2013 the elderly, people with comorbidities, and the disabled community?\n\nAs of May 31, just about two million people have received at least one dose of the vaccine. Assuming that about a million of these individuals are frontline workers from the first phase of PICK and young adults who signed up for the AstraZeneca-Oxford jab (numbers are likely higher), that means Malaysia has vaccinated only a million high-risk individuals, or 11 per cent of the 9.4 million targeted.\n\nCITF has yet to publish statistics on the number of high-risk people who have received Covid-19 vaccines so far.\n\nIn the month of May alone, 1,290 people lost their lives to Covid-19 in Malaysia, nearly triple the 471 fatalities recorded in the whole of last year. Although an increasing number of younger adults are dying from Covid-19 in the new wave of the Malaysian epidemic, the elderly remain the primary victims.\n\nAbout 74 per cent of 1,290 people who died from Covid-19 last month, or 955 individuals, were aged 60 years and above. Nearly nine in 10 victims had underlying health conditions, 75 per cent of whom were aged 60 or older.\n\nDozens of people have been dying from Covid-19 every day in Malaysia in the past three weeks. When hospitals and intensive care units (ICUs) are full, our vaccination strategy should focus on reducing the number of people with Covid-19 requiring hospital or critical care, not to cut infections.\n\nPeople who receive vaccination can still contract Covid-19 and possibly infect others, but all approved coronavirus vaccines prevent severe disease and death.\n\nChasing illusory single-digit daily infections \u2013 or even triple-digit infections at this point \u2013 is an impossible endeavour that will take at least six months or even a year, depending on how fast we can inoculate two-thirds of our adult population. As of yesterday, only about 8 per cent of Malaysia\u2019s adult population has received at least one dose.\n\nIf CITF is now changing its vaccination strategy to focus on working adults to prevent further economically devastating lockdowns, then CITF should make this clear. In a scenario with limited resources \u2013 vaccine supply, manpower to run PPVs, and outreach efforts \u2013 there must be priority groups in whichever strategy, whether it\u2019s to protect the most vulnerable or to keep the economy going.\n\nThe UK recorded zero new Covid-19 deaths yesterday for the first time since July 2020. This achievement came after the UK took about six months to vaccinate nearly 75 per cent of the adult population, or over 39 million people, with at least one vaccine dose.\n\nThe UK\u2019s coronavirus vaccination programme, which opened up in phases according to age, hit its target of offering a first jab to all those in top priority groups \u2013 those aged 50 or older as well as people in high-risk categories \u2013 before April 15.\n\nEngland and Scotland have now started offering first vaccines to people aged 30 and above, while Northern Ireland and Wales have begun vaccinating over-18s. Due to the emergence of the variant first discovered in India, renamed the \u201cDelta\u201d variant, England is accelerating second vaccine doses to adults aged 50 and above.\n\nThe UK has the benefit of most residents, including non-nationals, being registered with its NHS, making it easy to reach out to senior citizens for Covid-19 vaccination. Malaysia, on the other hand, has serious challenges in providing vaccine access to the elderly, many of whom live in the community with their families or on their own instead of care homes.\n\nThe over 62,000 no-shows at Covid-19 vaccination appointments in Kedah, Pahang, Kelantan, Perak, Negeri Sembilan, Melaka, Perlis, and Terengganu \u2013 attributed to lack of transport to PPVs and not checking the MySejahtera app for appointment dates \u2013 illustrate the immense difficulty in reaching the elderly population.\n\nBut this does not mean the government should abandon senior citizens and switch focus to easier targets.

Covid-19 vaccinations onsite at shopping malls for participating retail tenants is not profiteering, the Malaysia Shopping Malls Association (PPK Malaysia) said today.\n\nInstead, the association representing shopping malls claimed that the actual estimated cost for logistics and the health personnel needed to administer the Covid-19 vaccines could go up to RM100 and even RM150, and that the malls had actually decided to subsidise the cost with plans to only collect RM50.\n\nPPK Malaysia was speaking of the plans to have onsite Covid-19 vaccination at shopping malls for employees of retail outlets in the malls, through a \u201cpublic-private sector partnership\u201d model.\n\nWhile confirming that the Covid-19 vaccines will be provided by the Malaysian government for free under this partnership PPK Malaysia said shopping malls will be paying for the fees for doctors, nurses and medical officers to Health Ministry-owned ProtectHealth Corporation and all other antecedent costs.\n\nEarlier this week, notices had circulated on social media of purported plans by shopping malls to offer Covid-19 vaccination to retail tenants\u2019 staff at RM50 per person for two doses (with some giving a breakdown of RM15 for administration per dose and RM10 for logistics per dose).\n\nPPK Malaysia said the planned collection of RM50 was meant partly to secure commitment by retail staff to ensure that they would show up for the vaccination, as well as to pay for the services of administering the Covid-19 vaccine to be provided by the private healthcare providers coordinated by ProtectHealth Corporation.\n\n\u201cOur Association members estimated that the cost of providing the venue, logistics, manpower, standby ambulance service etc for the on-site vaccination centre will amount to RM100 to RM150 per pax, depending on volume and total number of doses available each day, the total population to be vaccinated and the duration to complete all the doses.\n\n\u201cIn the interests of the national agenda, it was decided that the malls shall largely subsidise these costs and be allowed to charge merely RM10 x 2 doses = RM20 per pax to partially defray their expenses and as a commitment by the registrant so as to mitigate absenteeism, leading to wastage of vaccines which would otherwise could be administered to those yet to be scheduled and in order to reach herd immunity of the community in the shortest possible time.\n\n\u201cWe were also informed that the doctors and nurses providing their service will be allocated by the Protect Health Corporation who will charge to administer per dose at RM15.\n\n\u201cTherefore, at RM15 per dose x 2 doses equalling RM30, plus the above nominal sum of RM20 to partially defray logistic expenses, a total of RM50 for 2 doses will be charged to participants, principally only our shopping frontliners,\u201d the shopping malls association explained in a statement today.\n\nCovid-19 vaccination urgently needed, speed is key\n\nIn the same statement, PPK Malaysia said it appreciates shopping malls for recognising the need to subsidise the Covid-19 vaccination costs for retail frontliners, in order to protect the retail industry through immunisation and as an overall corporate social responsibility (CSR) contribution towards the national agenda of urgently achieving herd immunity.\n\n\u201cIt has been proven in several overseas countries that the speed of vaccinations is the way to bring down the rate of infections, coupled with self-discipline and strict adherence to SOPs instead of prolonging the need for further MCOs,\u201d it said, referring to the movement control orders (MCO) in the country.\n\nNoting that the Covid-19 vaccination for the public is being planned on a different schedule, the association said the primary purpose for the partnership with the government was to vaccinate all employees of shopping malls and malls\u2019 business outlets, adding that it is believed that the malls would be \u201cmuch safer places for the public to shop with confidence and with peace of mind\u201d once such vaccination is carried out.\n\n\u201cDespite our good intentions, we are distraught with the negative comments in the media that malls are profiteering from this exercise which is extremely far from the truth,\u201d it said, adding that this statement was issued in order to correct and put the record straight.\n\nIt noted that the \u201curgent need for access to vaccination\u201d was reflected in the shopping malls\u2019 \u201centhusiastic participation\u201d and the \u201coverwhelming registration\u201d by mall employees and mall tenants for the proposed onsite Covid-19 vaccination at malls.\n\n\u201cWe truly look forward to the success of this win-win collaboration with the authorities towards the national objective of achieving herd immunity urgently and the ultimate recovery of the economy in due course,\u201d the association said.\n\nEarlier in the statement, PPK Malaysia explained the reasoning for the idea of vaccinating mall tenants\u2019 staff onsite at shopping malls, while also providing updates on the progress of this plan.\n\nCiting the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi\u2019s May 28 announcement of plans to vaccinate an estimated 500,000 employees in the retail industry under the country\u2019s economic frontliners (retail sector) Covid-19 immunisation programme, PPK Malaysia said it lauded the government\u2019s targeting of the relevant economic sectors to speed up the Covid-19 vaccination programme.\n\n\u201cShopping malls together with all retail tenants\u2019 staff are effectively frontliners and we feel that it is imperative for the vaccination exercise to be implemented expeditiously. When vaccinated, our frontliners will not only protect themselves but more importantly, duly protect the shoppers and the public.\n\n\u201cWe are also appreciative that our proposal for on-site vaccination centres at shopping malls is adopted as it is more efficient and logical to bring the medical personnel to come on-site to administer the vaccinations instead of all the staff having to take time off work to travel to outside vaccination centres, thus interrupting business and daily operations,\u201d PPK Malaysia said.\n\nIn the May 28 statement by the KPDNHEP minister, he too had spoken of his ministry\u2019s cooperation with the Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) for the vaccination of \u201ceconomic frontliners\u201d in the retail sector expected to start in June, and had also spoke on discussions involving CITF on the same day with 60 representatives from the retail industry.\n\nThe minister had also on May 28 spoken of his ministry\u2019s cooperation with PPK Malaysia, the Malaysia Retailers Association (MRA), and Malaysia Retail Chain Association (MRCA) to establish Covid-19 vaccination centres (PPVs) at strategic locations nationwide, while also urging all retail companies to join this vaccination programme to help achieve the government\u2019s target of vaccinating 80 per cent of the population before the year ends.\n\nToday, PPK Malaysia said such an initiative in collaboration with the authorities has received \u201centhusiastic response\u201d from its members malls and retailers, noting that more than 50 malls have already notified their interest to host PPVs nationwide.\n\n\u201cDetails of this programme and the confirmed locations are being finalised and will be announced, once approved in due course, and we do look forward to the rollout by end of June 2021 onwards as scheduled,\u201d it said, having noted that it had already had several meetings with the authorities on this public-private sector partnership for Covid-19 vaccination.\n\nAbout ProtectHealth Corporation\n\nOn its website, ProtectHealth Corporation Sdn Bhd states that the not-for-profit company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Health Ministry\u2019s ProtectHealth Malaysia. It further states that it was appointed by the ministry to implement the participation of private medical practitioners in the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme.\n\nBased on information on ProtectHealth\u2019s website, private general practitioners do not need to pay to participate in the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme, but would have to receive training and also prepare their own personal protective equipment.\n\nThe website also states that ProtectHealth would pay general practitioners RM14 for their administration of each dose of Covid-19 vaccines through clinic and community outreach models, while payment of RM45 per hour would be paid to them for Covid-19 vaccination under government-organised mass vaccination models.\n\nProtectHealth Corporation denied collecting payments from shopping centres purportedly rolling out Covid-19 inoculation drives with vaccinators from ProtectHealth Corp.\n\n\u201cProtectHealth involvement remains the same for all vaccination centres. We pay private medical practitioners RM14 per dose administered,\u201d Khairul Faizi from the corporate communications unit of ProtectHealth Corp told CodeBlue today.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t supply vaccines as our role is managing the private medical practitioners. The vaccine supply is done by the government, similar to other vaccination centres.\u201d\n\nHealth news portal CodeBlue yesterday reported ProtectHealth Corporation as stating its role as merely managing the private medical practitioners carrying out Covid-19 vaccination work and that it pays RM14 per dose administered to such private healthcare personnel.\n\nCodeBlue yesterday also reported ProtectHealth Corporation as denying collecting payments from shopping malls for Covid-19 vaccination in collaboration with the company. \u2013 MalayMail", "keyword": ["shopping", "fee",

a landmark decision, the Intellectual Property High Court in Kuala Lumpur has declared that the sale, offer for sale, distribution and/or supply of TV Boxes or illicit streaming devices (ISDs) that can provide unauthorised access to copyrighted works, constitutes copyright infringement under the Copyright Act 1987.\n\nThe action in the Intellectual Property High Court was brought by satellite operator Measat Broadcast Networks, the service provider for Malaysian pay-TV platform Astro, against a seller of ISDs preloaded with applications which act as gateways to websites or content servers streaming pirated content.\n\nThe historic judgment, considered to be the first by the Intellectual Property High Court, is positively received by the authorities and industry players in their battle against digital piracy. Industry leaders including Astro laud the High Court\u2019s judgement as a bold step in the right direction against piracy in Malaysia.\n\n\u201cThe declaration by the High Court that sale of ISD which allows access to unauthorised copyright content amounts to copyright infringement sets a precedent for future civil claims on copyright infringement against ISD sellers in the market, including those on e-commerce platforms,\u201d stated Laila Saat, Director, Regulatory of Astro. \u201cThis ground-breaking declaration will strengthen intellectual property protection in the country and ongoing anti-piracy efforts, which are pivotal to ensure continuous investment and job creation in Malaysia\u2019s media and entertainment industry. We will continue to work with authorities and content partners to send a strong message that content piracy is theft, illegal and punishable by law.\u201d\n\n\u201cMCMC welcomes the court\u2019s decision, this will strengthen the legal aspects in protecting copyright infringement and battle against piracy, especially in digital and networked forms,\u201d added Zulkarnain Mohd Yasin, Chief Regulatory Officer of the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC).\n\n\u201cAcknowledging that more proactive action is needed to fight digital piracy in the country, FINAS expresses full support for legal action taken by Astro against ISD sellers and all digital piracy activities as these illegal activities has caused the local creative industry a huge loss in revenue every year,\u201d commented Dr. Ahmad Idham Ahmad Nadzri, CEO of the National Film Development Corporation Malaysia (FINAS). \u201cIn driving more holistic and effective strategy battling digital piracy, FINAS has established the Digital Piracy Eradication Committee with the collective support and involvement of relevant law enforcement agencies to further empower and strengthen enforcement, regulations and the terms of distribution licences in line with the provisions under the FINAS Act 244 1981\u201d.\n\n\u201cMyIPO looks forward for cases concerning ISDs to be brought forward to the Malaysian court,\u201d said Zulkarnain Muhammad, Deputy Director General of the Intellectual Property Corporation of Malaysia (MyIPO). \u201cPrevalent and widespread use of ISDs cause far more economic harm than physical copyright piracy. These devices are part of a wider network of online copyright piracy, which will in the long run disincentive original creators from producing creative work. Copyright piracy in any form should be curbed and deterred.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision is the correct one and we welcome it whole-heartedly,\u201d declared Louis Boswell, CEO of the Asia Video Industry Association (AVIA). \u201cContent is not made for free, and it is the right of creators and distributors to charge for it. To circumvent this and steal it is theft, and I see little difference between the theft of physical goods and the theft of video streams. As a society we need to do more to recognise theft for what it is and this ruling is a strong step in that direction.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is an important and welcome declaration by the Intellectual Property High Court, and sends a clear message that the sale of ISDs that provide unauthorised access to copyrighted works constitutes copyright infringement,\u201d asserted Kevin Plumb, Premier League Director of Legal Services. \u201cThe Premier League is committed to pursuing all those involved with providing illegal access to Premier League content as well as working to raise awareness of the risks fans face when watching via unauthorised sources. We will continue to work with Astro and local authorities as part of our ongoing anti-piracy programme in Malaysia.\u201d\n\nThe estimated loss to the industry and Malaysian economy due to piracy is over RM3 billion (\u20ac590m) annually with RM500 million in taxes and thousands of jobs at risk.\n\nThe declaration by the High Court follows recent criminal cases successfully brought against ISD retailers. On February 8th, a company director of an IT company was charged at the Shah Alam Sessions Court under Section 41 (1) (ha) of the Copyright Act 1987 with promoting Long TV Android boxes which allow the bypassing of technological protection measures on copyright broadcast work. On February 16th, a woman director of a mobile accessory company pleaded guilty to a charge of possessing TV media boxes that contains software to illegally stream Astro\u2019s content via the Internet. She was fined RM30,000 under Section 232(2) of the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998, making her the first ISD seller to be charged under this provision.\n\nThe Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) reiterated that it will take stern action against suppliers and sellers who misuse devices and software to illegally access content protected by their copyright work

Court in Luak, Miri on last Friday as blatant abuse of power and inhumane by the police.\n\nAccording to Aidi, a team from the Miri district police station was sent to the premises at around 9.30am after they received a public tip-off that the stalls there were serving dine-in breakfast to customers.\n\n\u201cAt the premises, the team witnessed that one of the stall operator was in the midst of preparing dine-in dishes for her customers,\u201d said Aidi.\n\nThe team also reported that upon realising the presence of the police, a few of the customers quickly left the premises and a worker quickly cleared-up the table.\n\nAidi said the premises had violated the current SOP of \u2018no dining-in\u2019 as the tables and chairs appeared to have been arranged for dine-in purposes.\n\n\u201cInside the premises, a man was sitting alone at a table and ignored the presence of the police. He also refused to cooperate with the team when questioned,\u201d said Aidi, adding that police had no choice but to issue him a compound.\n\nHe said it was only after the issuance of compound that the man claimed that he was a stall operator and voiced out his dissatisfaction for being issued with a compound.\n\nAidi said the stall operator, who was eating at a table in the premises, had indirectly encouraged other customers to dine-in at the premises.\n\n\u201cFurther checks on the stall operator revealed that he only has a business licence and not a licence from the Miri City Council,\u201d Aidi added.\n\nTherefore, he said what Ling had claimed in his statement was utterly wrong as evidence could be found from the premises\u2019 closed-circuit television (CCTV).\n\n\u201cFrom this, there was no blatant abuse of power and inhumane act by the police as claimed by Ling,\u201d Aidi added.\n\nThe owner of the premise is also urged to handover a copy of the CCTV footage to the police for further investigation under the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Act 1988.\n\nMeanwhile, Aidi said the police are working together with the government in the fight to break the infection chain of the Covid-19 virus in Sarawak.\n\n\u201cThe infection rate of the virus in Sarawak is worrying and everyone is urged to abide to the SOP as set by the Malaysian National Security Council,\u201d he added.", "keyword": ["aidi", "dinein", "senator", "team", "claim", "sop", "abuse", "stall", "miri", "statement", "operator", "act", "premises", "denies", "power", "lings", "chief"], "summary": "\u201cAt the premises, the team witnessed that one of the stall operator was in the midst of preparing dine-in dishes for her customers,\u201d said Aidi.\nHe said it was only after the issuance of compound that the man claimed that he was a stall operator and voiced out his dissatisfaction for being issued with a compound.\nAidi said the stall operator, who was eating at a table in the premises, had indirectly encouraged other customers to dine-in at the premises.\n\u201cFurther checks on the stall operator revealed that he only has a business licence and not a licence from the Miri City Council,\u201d Aidi added.\n\u201cFrom this, there was no blatant abuse of power and inhumane act by the police as claimed by Ling,\u201d Aidi added.", "news": "The Borneo Post", "date": "2021-05-23 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Lead example, Lo tells politicians in curbing Covid-19 pandemic", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWJvcm5lb3Bvc3QuY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvMjIvbGVhZC1leGFtcGxlLWxvLXRlbGxzLXBvbGl0aWNpYW5zLWluLWN1cmJpbmctY292aWQtMTktcGFuZGVtaWMv0gEA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2019/04/Andrew-Lo.jpeg", "text": "KUCHING (May 22): The Malaysian Trade Union Congress (MTUC) Sarawak has demanded for leadership by example in efforts to flatten the Covid-19 pandemic curve in the country.\n\nIts secretary Andrew Lo said until and unless the national and state political leaders step up and demonstrate leadership by example, Malaysia, including Sarawak, will not see an end to the Covid-19 pandemic any time soon.\n\nHe said MTUC Sarawak was quite amused by the Prime Minister\u2019s announcement that the National Security Council will tighten enforcement of the Movement Control Order (MCO) 3.0.\n\nThe Prime Minister, he noted, had inadvertently admitted that there had been loose enforcement the past 15 months.\n\n\u201cMTUC certainly does not condone any non-compliance of the standard operating procedures (SOP) and MCO.\n\n\u201cHowever we must question the many cases of Ministers and very important peoples (VIPs) that appears not to follow these restrictions and got off with a slap of the wrist, at most.\n\n\u201cWe even have Minister that was out of the country for weeks.

Could it be that PBS, just like Warisan, had also rejected Kitingan\u2019s overtures to officially join PN?\u201d he said in a statement today.\n\nKitingan, who heads STAR, a PN component party, had earlier today said he was open to the idea of opposition party Warisan joining the ruling coalition.\n\nThe Keningau MP said STAR was open to the idea and believed everybody should be invited into PN, including Warisan.\n\n\u201cThey have assemblymen who want to serve their constituencies. So, why not do this together?\n\n\u201cGRS is open (to the idea) and we have discussed it actually. Even the chief minister is open to it,\u201d Kitingan said.\n\nAlthough Warisan has rejected Kitingan\u2019s offer, the party has not, however, addressed the invitation initially made by PBS president Maximus Ongkili to join PN.\n\nOngkili had yesterday clarified remarks he made that he was willing to work with any opposition party, including Warisan.\n\nOngkili said his actual intention was to express PBS\u2019 openness to have Warisan cooperate with the state and federal governments to achieve their common development goals for the good of Sabah and Sabahans.\n\nIn his statement today, Siambun said Kitingan should realise that Warisan president Shafie Apdal\u2019s reply on his preference to work with PBS was merely a response to a question by a journalist on whether there had been any discussion with other parties on a potential partnership.\n\n\u201cShafie\u2019s preference to work with PBS was because it shares similar struggles for Sabahans as Warisan and that Ongkili is a long-time personal friend of Shafie and a consistent advocate on Sabah\u2019s rights as well.\n\n\u201cPBS is also a state-based party that had been consistent throughout these years since its formation and had been a victim of party-hopping,\u201d he said, referring to the fall of the PBS government after the state elections in 1994.\n\nSiambun also pointed out that the unique position held by PBS in the government allows it to determine the course and direction of the party without being dictated by others.\n\n\u201cPBS is not an official component member of Barisan Nasional or PN but only supports the government of the day. The support we give is contingent upon ensuring the Malaysia Agreement 1963 is wholly implemented.\n\n\u201cThis could be the reason why Ongkili was given the task to helm the Sabah and Sarawak affairs ministry in the Prime Minister\u2019s Department,\u201d he said.\n\nSiambun also said Warisan did not wish to be associated with PAS that had rejected a bill to amend Article 1(2) of the Federal Constitution.\n\nThe bill was intended to reinstate Sabah and Sarawak to their original status prior to a 1976 constitutional amendment.\n\nHe said Kitingan, whose STAR party is a formal member of PN, also worked closely with PAS, which had outrightly rejected the bill initiated by the late Liew Vui Keong, the former de facto law minister.\n\nHe said Kitingan should clarify why he is willing to work with PAS which has a nominated assemblyman in the Sabah state assembly now.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["open", "laughs", "party", "work", "warisan", "state", "pbs", "pn", "join", "invitation", "kitingan", "rejected", "jeffreys"], "summary": "KOTA KINABALU: State opposition party Warisan has declined an invitation by Perikatan Nasional deputy chairman Jeffrey Kitingan to join the ruling coalition, saying the invite was \u201chumorous\u201d.\nCould it be that PBS, just like Warisan, had also rejected Kitingan\u2019s overtures to officially join PN?\u201d he said in a statement today.\nKitingan, who heads STAR, a PN component party, had earlier today said he was open to the idea of opposition party Warisan joining the ruling coalition.\nThe Keningau MP said STAR was open to the idea and believed everybody should be invited into PN, including Warisan.\nAlthough Warisan has rejected Kitingan\u2019s offer, the party has not, however, addressed the invitation initially made by PBS president Maximus Ongkili to join PN.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-05-21 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "AirAsia\u2019s digital businesses to become Asean\u2019s leading super app", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWFsYXlzaWFucmVzZXJ2ZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNS8yOC9haXJhc2lhcy1kaWdpdGFsLWJ1c2luZXNzZXMtdG8tYmVjb21lLWFzZWFucy1sZWFkaW5nLXN1cGVyLWFwcC_SAW5odHRwczovL3RoZW1hbGF5c2lhbnJlc2VydmUuY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvMjgvYWlyYXNpYXMtZGlnaXRhbC1idXNpbmVzc2VzLXRvLWJlY29tZS1hc2VhbnMtbGVhZGluZy1zdXBlci1hcHAvYW1wLw?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://themalaysianreserve.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/AIRASIA-APP.jpg", "text": "By AZALEA AZUAR / Pic credit: airasia.com\n\nAirAsia Group Bhd\u2019s non-airline digital businesses is on the right track to becoming Asean\u2019s digital travel and lifestyle platform as it meets strong consumer demands.\n\nIts super app is now considered one of the region\u2019s top three online travel agencies (OTA) while AirAsia\u2019s e-wallet BigPay is set to become the first virtual bank and its delivery service Teleport is strengthening.\n\nDuring the group\u2019s first quarter of 2021 (1Q21) financial performance announcement on May 27, AirAsia super app posted a 45% year-on-year (YoY) increase in its revenue to RM10 million supported by solid growth of products and services available on the platform.\n\nTeleport\u2019s revenue has also tripled compared to its 1Q20 performance.\n\nAccording to AirAsia Group CEO Tan Sri Tony Fernandes, just as they revolutionised air travel 20 years ago with their low-cost carrier, AirAsia is now disrupting and democratising the lifestyle industry again through the development of their super app with over 17 travel and products leveraging off one another.\n\n\u201cIn just over a year we are now one of the top three leading online travel agencies (OTAs) in Asean based on website traffic, with over 100 million average page views monthly on airasia.com.\n\n\u201cIn the future, when travel resumes in our key markets, we can guarantee best value prices for our flight and hotel packages because we own our own airline,\u201d he explained in a press release today.\n\nExpansion of its popular products and services to its Asean markets for its super app is in AirAsia\u2019s pipeline.\n\n\u201cWe are working on expanding our health services in Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines, while offering SNAP hotel and accommodation deals in Vietnam and Singapore in the near future,\u201d said Fernandes.\n\nHe also said that Teleport not only provides the usual deliveries but has now been delivering vaccines all over Malaysia and the Asean region. Hence, it has created more than 4,000 delivery driver jobs in 17 key markets.\n\n\u201cWe are also looking forward to converting passenger planes into freighters in the coming months to cater for unprecedented cargo demand,\u201d he said.\n\nFernandes added that the group has plans to improve its BigPay e-wallet to become the best virtual bank in Asean.\n\n\u201cWe are tapping into the full potential of our loyalty platform BIG Rewards, to provide the best range for rewards and redemption in Asean and beyond.\n\n\u201cThrough our digital ecosystem, we have already created thousands of jobs and supported more than 3,500 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Malaysia.\n\n\u201cOur training centre, AirAsia Academy (currently known as Redbeat Academy), offers affordable digital and tech training courses to equip not only our own employees, but also SMEs and members of the public, with skills to bridge the technology gap in Malaysia and beyond in this ever changing digital world,\u201d he said.\n\nApart from AirAsia\u2019s digital services, its other non-airline businesses such as AirAsia Food, AirAsia Fresh, AirAsia Shop and its Santan franchise restaurants are also penetrating into new markets.\n\n\u201cAs we continue to expand our digital footprint in Malaysia and other Asean countries, our contribution in the region will only increase and become more significant from here onwards.\n\n\u201cWe saw the crisis as an opportunity to use the downtime in flying caused by the pandemic to leverage the strength of our database of over 60 million customers and to focus on developing new non airline revenue streams in the key areas of e-commerce, fintech and logistics,\u201d Fernandes commented.\n\nAirAsia has more innovations to roll out such as the ride-hailing \u201cAirAsia Ride\u201d, which will be launched in the coming months, as well as the potential of drone delivery.\n\nThe group is also planning for electric or hydronic aeroplanes to meet consumer\u2019s sustainability needs.\n\n\u201cIn the airline business, Asia Digital Engineering (ADE) is set to become one of the region\u2019s best value aircraft maintenance and overhaul providers for both short term line maintenance and longer-term base maintenance, a space previously dominated by Singapore-based maintenance and overhaul companies (MROs).\n\n\u201cI firmly believe ADE will become the leading aircraft maintenance/overhaul company in the region in the near future with significant potential growth opportunities in Asean and beyond with service excellence and the lowest cost base,\u201d he said.\n\nAirAsia is also working to launch more contactless technologies to make flying a seamless and hygienic experience when it resumes.\n\nThis includes a digital passport called Scan2Fly where passengers can upload required medical documentation and have it verified in real time online, before heading to the airport.\n\nThe group would also be introducing FACES, its biometric facial recognition technology at Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2 (KLIA 2) and it will be rolled out across all key destinations.\n\n\u201cThere is a silver lining to every crisis and the best thing to come out of this pandemic is our recovery as a stronger, more resilient travel and lifestyle platform \u2013 not solely reliant on airfares alone anymore,\u201d said Fernandes.\n\nThe \u201cnew look\u201d AirAsia would be embarking on an exciting new phase of growth, with the right focus and foundations to better meet the needs of the digital revolution.\n\nFernandes stressed that they would remain true to their promise of delivering high quality service serving the underserved by making it affordable to fly, stay, shop, eat and upskill.\n\n\u201cLooking out for the everyday people is what we do best and we aim to continue to support them, not only in the major cities, but also in the smaller cities we serve, where many people are struggling the most and access to products and services are more limited.\u201d", "keyword": ["asean", "maintenance", "aseans", "travel", "services", "super", "app", "airasias", "airasia",

open and detailed revelation of an intrusion by China\u2019s air force has raised many questions that the government needs to answer, says an expert in defence and diplomacy matters.\n\n\u201cThe biggest question is how the government, in particular Wisma Putra, is going to resolve it?\u201d asked the expert, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nThe expert said, however, that the RMAF\u2019s \u201cextremely rare\u201d move to reveal details of the incident which saw its fighter jets being scrambled to intercept 16 People\u2019s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) planes in Malaysia\u2019s maritime zone (ZMM), provided a \u201cgolden opportunity\u201d for the country.\n\nThe source said while the possibility that the PLAAF was carrying out surveillance in the area could not be ruled out, the Chinese could also have been \u201ctesting the waters\u201d over Malaysia\u2019s air defence systems and its reaction.\n\nThe \u201cbreach of Malaysian airspace and sovereignty\u201d \u2013 as foreign affairs minister Hishammuddin Hussein termed it \u2013 by the Chinese aircraft is the latest in a series of actions by China in the disputed South China Sea that has its neighbours worried.\n\nFor years, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei, Taiwan and Vietnam have been contesting China\u2019s claim to almost all of the South China Sea. These countries have often protested against China over what they claimed were intrusions into their territories.\n\nIn recent years, the dispute over the sea has seen a rise in tensions not only between China and these nations but also between China and the US. As recent as May 20, China and the US exchanged strong words over US naval activity in the region.\n\nThe expert asked what the rules of engagement would have been had the Chinese planes not turned back when the RMAF scrambled its jets.\n\n\u201cTypically, when an air force is confronted with such a situation, they would fire a warning shot or resort to aggressive manoeuvres to \u2018force\u2019 the foreign planes to turn back. Were our Hawks armed for engagement? How many Hawks were deployed?\n\n\u201cMy question is why did we scramble our Hawk 208 fighters? Those are advanced trainer jets, light fighter jets. They do not have the same interception capabilities of our Sukhoi Su-30MKM or F/A-18 Hornets.\n\n\u201cAre they airworthy? Or were the Hawks deployed because they are closest to that part of the South China Sea? If so, why are we not stationing more advanced fighters closer to the region?\u201d\n\nHe commended Hishammuddin for saying Wisma Putra would summon the Chinese ambassador to explain the incident.\n\nThe Chinese, the expert said, had already said the flight by the 16 planes was routine training and that it had not entered any other country\u2019s territorial air space under international law.\n\n\u201cEssentially, the Chinese are saying they have done nothing wrong. But Wisma Putra wants an explanation on the breach of Malaysian airspace and sovereignty.\n\n\u201cSo who is telling the truth? And what happens next? Will China apologise? I doubt they will, given their stance on the South China Sea.\u201d\n\nThe expert said if Wisma Putra was not satisfied with China\u2019s explanation and if the country refused to apologise, Malaysia should take the \u201cbold\u201d step of expelling the Chinese ambassador and recalling the Malaysian ambassador in China.\n\n\u201cIn diplomatic lexicon, expelling an ambassador is a very serious statement. I think if we do not do so, we (Malaysia) run the risk of looking weak.\u201d\n\nStill, the expert said, the incident provided Malaysia with the \u201cgolden opportunity\u201d to analyse and address defence issues, including the placement of frontline fighter jets and pattern of violations by foreign forces, particularly in the hotly disputed South China Sea.\n\nMeanwhile, defence analyst Lam Choong Wah said Asean and China were currently negotiating a code of conduct (CoC) for the South China Sea and that these negotiations needed to be sped up to regulate the behaviour of military operations in the region.\n\n\u201cMalaysia should utilise all available diplomatic channels to handle the issue to preserve national interests,\u201d Lam said.\n\n\u201cBeing firm or soft is not the crux of the problem. The core issue is there is no CoC in place to regulate military behavior in disputed areas, and until there is a CoC, military or maritime enforcement standoffs will take place from time to time.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["expert", "force", "wisma", "planes", "south", "malaysian", "chinese", "jets", "chinas", "intrusion", "putrajaya", "resolve", "sea", "putra"], "summary": "\u201cThe biggest question is how the government, in particular Wisma Putra, is going to resolve it?\u201d asked the expert, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.\nFor years, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei, Taiwan and Vietnam have been contesting China\u2019s claim to almost all of the South China Sea.\nThe expert asked what the rules of engagement would have been had the Chinese planes not turned back when the RMAF scrambled its jets.\n\u201cTypically, when an air force is confronted with such a situation, they would fire a warning shot or resort to aggressive manoeuvres to \u2018force\u2019 the foreign planes to turn back.\nBut Wisma Putra wants an explanation on the breach of Malaysian airspace and sovereignty.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-06-03 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Take more from KWAN to help M40, B40 groups, says Najib", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wNi8wMi90YWtlLW1vcmUtZnJvbS1rd2FuLXRvLWhlbHAtbTQwLWI0MC1ncm91cHMtc2F5cy1uYWppYi_SAQA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Fmt Reporters"], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/02-PANIC-BUYING-MC0-3.0.jpg", "text": "PETALING JAYA: Former prime minister Najib Razak has urged the government to take another RM4.2 billion from the National Trust Fund (KWAN) to assist the (bottom 40) B40 and (middle 40) M40 groups during the total lockdown.\n\nIn a Facebook post, he assured that Barisan Nasional would replenish the funds in the future.\n\nNajib also questioned if the current allocation of RM100 each for single Malaysians and RM500 for each B40 household with at least three children was sufficient.\n\n\u201cOn top of that, this assistance comes after they have faced MCO 2.0 and MCO 3.0/3.1 for five months, and now the total lockdown,\u201d he said.\n\nNajib noted that the payments would only come in by the end of June, while the additional RM500 for the Prihatin Special Grant (GKP) recipients was due in July.\n\nHe added that GKP recipients should also be eligible for Bantuan Prihatin Rakyat, as they had the additional burden of bearing the losses faced by their businesses.\n\nNajib said the Perikatan Nasional administration could dip into KWAN again if it wished to avoid borrowing more money, since it had already borrowed over RM100 billion for BPR aid within the first five months of the year.\n\nWith the additional funds from KWAN, Najib said, more could be handed out under the Bantuan Prihatin aid scheme.\n\n\u201cThe RM300 to RM500 will become RM900 to RM1,500 for B40 families.

It\u2019s sad at first, but whatever happened, happened and it\u2019s best to move on and be strong,\u201d said the 33-year-old content creator from Selangor, when we spoke on Sunday (30 May).\n\nFahmi had been confirmed positive with Covid-19 after getting tested at the Covid Assessment Centre (CAC) in Stadium Melawati, Shah Alam on 21 May. That same day, he was sent straight to the PKRC to undergo more than a week of mandatory quarantine.\n\n\u201cI have three days to go. They count it from the day you first did your swab test and 10 days after that.\u201d he explained, mentioning how all of his close contacts were fortunate enough to have not contracted the virus.\n\nSharing his experiences, Fahmi revealed how his body had reacted over the course of his infection.\n\nMy symptoms came in pretty late, each day one symptom. First came the sore throat, fever the day after, then I started to lose my sense of smell and taste, then I started to feel heavy breathing and panting. But nothing serious. That\u2019s why they sent me to MAEPS because here they have the equipment to scan my lungs.\n\nFahmi also said that the medical staff stationed at the PKRC had been very reliable and responsive to his needs and everyone else who\u2019s there.\n\nQuarantine life\n\nWith thousands of other Covid-19 patients confined together at the \u2018DG Hall\u2019 in MAEPS, Fahmi noted his shock when first arriving at the PKRC and said that quarantine life took some getting used to.\n\n\u201cI was of course surprised by the insane number of people here, to the point that there are not enough beds. People have to sleep on mattresses on the floor,\u201d he said, adding that without any appropriate shower facility there, patients also have to contend with long bathroom lines and having to bathe on the toilet.\n\nHowever, despite the minor discomforts, Fahmi said everything at the PKRC had been satisfactory and personally relates life in quarantine to what people might find in boarding schools.\n\n\u201cFood is served three times a day. Breakfast is at 8 am, lunch at 12 noon and dinner at 6 pm.

The key to surviving here is to just make friends to keep yourself sane.\n\nWith the time spent living with a deadly disease and after having been in the Covid-19 isolation camp, Fahmi said that the best way to overcome it all is with positive thinking and not giving up.\n\nI was scared, anything could happen and I was afraid I wasn\u2019t going to come back.

Let\u2019s find out.\n\nThe phone looks pretty good on the back too, so when you\u2019re taking pictures of other people at least they\u2019ll be looking towards you. (Credit: TRP)\n\nA phone catered to selfie enthusiasts\n\nAs advertised by the company, the V21\u2019s main selling point has to be its selfie camera with tonnes of options for you to play with such as adjusting brightness all the way, to toning your cheeks.\n\nAnd apparently, having nifty software tricks is not enough for the Chinese manufacturer as the phone is also fitted with \u2013 wait for it \u2013 two built-in flashlights which the company calls Dual Selfie Spotlight located on the front of the phone.\n\nYou know, just in case you\u2019re in a really, really, dark room and thought that this might be the best time to take a selfie.\n\nCredit: TRP\n\nThe V21 can even guide you on how to take a good selfie \u2013 complete with outlines showing you how to pose and take the shot.\n\nThe back camera is pretty good too if you\u2019re under good sunlight and it has three different lenses for you to choose from.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good in the hand and it\u2019s pretty too\n\nAlthough this phone has a screen size of 6.44 inches, the phone actually feels good in the hand and isn\u2019t super huge thanks to a design that stretches the panel out to the edge of the phone.\n\nIf you\u2019re a bit conservative and want your phone to blend in the background, there\u2019s the Dusk Blue colour option, but if you want it to get everyone\u2019s attention including your own, there\u2019s also Sunset Dazzle which is a real looker.\n\nThe colours on the body of the phone shift when you look at it from different angles which might entice some folks who want their phone to have a slightly funkier colour palette rather than having it just plain old black or white.\n\nCredit: TRP\n\nAll day phone\n\nThe Vivo V21 has quite a slim profile but don\u2019t think that it\u2019s not beefed up in the battery department because the phone can last you a full day even if you\u2019re consuming a lot of content.\n\nThere\u2019s also the option of fast charging if you manage to drain that big battery and they\u2019re not messing about. It\u2019s actually possible to get this thing from 0 to roughly above 50% within half an hour.\n\nCredit: TRP\n\nNot really a gaming phone\n\nThe phone might tick many boxes but gaming is not one of them.\n\nYes, you can play graphic intensive games like COD Mobile or PUBG Mobile, but I noticed that the V21 doesn\u2019t allow you to max out the settings, which might be a dealbreaker for some but if you\u2019re playing casual games, it will work just fine.\n\nShould you get the V21?\n\nIt\u2019s a great phone if you\u2019re someone who likes to take a lot of selfies as this where the phone truly shines. Literally.\n\nThere are not many phones that can say that they have one, let alone two flashes for the front camera and the amount of options is great for those who want to tweak their selfies.\n\nApart from the front camera, the V21 is also capable in other areas such as having a great screen for watching stuff like YouTube or Netflix, a pretty design, and also a large battery with the option of fast charging that borders on ridiculous.\n\nThe Vivo V21 is an affordable package and that not only looks good, but it feels good to use too.\n\nCredit: TRP\n\nShare your thoughts with us via TRP\u2019s Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.", "keyword": ["really", "youre", "camera", "phone", "good", "v21", "pretty", "taking", "having", "selfies", "vivo", "selfie", "review", "option"], "summary": "Vivo recently came out with the V21, a phone that takes aim at those who like to take a lot of selfies.\nBut, is a selfie camera really enough to entice you to get this phone?\nThe phone looks pretty good on the back too, so when you\u2019re taking pictures of other people at least they\u2019ll be looking towards you.\nYou know, just in case you\u2019re in a really, really, dark room and thought that this might be the best time to take a selfie.\nIt\u2019s a great phone if you\u2019re someone who likes to take a lot of selfies as this where the phone truly shines.", "news": "The Rakyat Post", "date": "2021-06-02 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "We need to prepare for the worst, says health DG", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wNS8yNS93ZS1uZWVkLXRvLXByZXBhcmUtZm9yLXRoZS13b3JzdC1zYXlzLWhlYWx0aC1kZy_SAQA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/noor-hisham-abdullah-fmt-080521-2.jpg", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: Health director-general Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah urged the public to prepare for the worst in facing the Covid-19 wave following an exponential trend indicated by the Covid-19 graph in this country.\n\n\u201cThe rise in cases started from April 1 and could trigger a vertical surge.

assured the people of Kapit, Song, Bukit Mabong, and Belaga districts that there are sufficient supplies of essential food items throughout this Gawai Dayak season.\n\nThe ministry\u2019s Kapit chief Al-Redzamani Abdul Razak said 10 items have been listed under the Festive Season Maximum Price Control Scheme (SHMMP) for Gawai until June 3.\n\nThey are live chicken, standard chicken (slaughtered and cleaned with legs, heads, liver and giblets or any part thereof), super chicken (slaughtered and cleaned, without legs, head, liver and giblets), Grade A chicken eggs (weighing between 65g and 69.9g), Grade B chicken eggs (weighing between 60g and 64.9g each), Grade C chicken eggs (weighing between 55g and 59.9g each), live old chicken, chicken wings, pork (belly), and pork (meat and fat).\n\n\u201cBased on our regular inspection and also the feedback from both retailers and suppliers, the supply level is stable and should be sufficient to meet the demands.\n\n\u201cNonetheless, our KPDNHEP teams continue to closely supervise and monitor the selling and buying trends during the current Movement Control Order (MCO) period, as well as to ensure every trader comply strictly with the price-control scheme for Gawai 2021.\n\n\u201cWe aim to advocate a healthy business environment and a win-win situation between the traders and the consumers,\u201d Al Redzamani said in a statement.\n\nHe also warned stern action would await any trader caught raising the price of any of the controlled items during the SHMMP Gawai 2021 period.\n\n\u201cAny consumer who finds any trader not abiding by the scheme, or notices other unscrupulous trading practices, can lodge a report by calling our hotline 1-800-886-800, or send WhatsApp texts via 019-2794317.\n\n\u201cAlso, seek KPDNHEP on Facebook, or go to Kapit KPDNHEP Office behind Meligai Hotel, which is open from 8am to 5pm on every regular working day,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, a survey here yesterday showed many shoppers stocking up not only for the Gawai Dayak celebration, but also for the the statewide MCO, which takes effect today.\n\nThe Terasang Market, Pasar Tani Kapit, Kapit Night Street Market, cold storage, and various supermarkets were crowded with more customers than usual.\n\nA local resident, who wish to be identified only as \u2018Madam Chen\u2019, said her husband reminded her to buy extra vegetables and meat for their family\u2019s consumption over the next few days.\n\n\u201cI bought various green vegetables, some pork, and also fish \u2013- these should last us for the next few days.\n\n\u201cWe, the adults, do not mind much, but the children are the ones who need more food to grow,\u201d the housewife from Jalan Selirik said when met at Terasang Market yesterday.\n\nPenghulu Allan Tubam said he had spent most of his time at his longhouse throughout the various stages of MCO.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t come down to Kapit town, unless there\u2019s some urgent or official duties that have to be attended to.\n\n\u201cI believe in looking after myself and my family as much as possible. I want to protect them from Covid-19. As a community leader, I need to set a good example for my followers,\u201d he said, adding that he and other community leaders had come to get their Covid-19 vaccination.\n\n\u201cThis morning (yesterday), I took the opportunity to buy some extra food, some drinks before returning to my longhouse.\n\n\u201cWith the MCO taking effect on May 29, I wouldn\u2019t do any Gawai shopping.

Earlier today, we were told that Perodua\u2019s Sentral facility in Section 19, Petaling Jaya remained closed, including its after-sales department. According to a source, the company is expected to make an announcement on the matter soon.\n\nLikewise, Edaran Tan Chong Motor (ETCM) announced yesterday via a FB post that all Nissan workshops are temporarily closed, pending application for operation. The company has not yet updated the status of its after-sales activities as of this point.\n\nMeanwhile, Honda dealerships that have obtained approval for after-sales service to continue have begun doing so. However, we were told by a source that not all Honda service centres are operational at this point, although more dealerships are attempting to get approval to operate their SCs. Honda Malaysia had previously announced that it would continue offering after-sales services during the lockdown period.\n\nThis is also the case with workshops and parts businesses, as approval by authorities is needed to open for business. Relevant documents are also necessary to ensure staff meet the necessary travel protocols. With enforcement being reportedly strict, many businesses allowed to operate during the FMCO are choosing to remain closed until they can obtain the necessary approval letters.\n\nEarlier, domestic trade and consumer affairs (KPDNHEP) minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi had stated that service centres as well as vehicle repair (body and paint) facilities would be allowed to operate during the lockdown, at 60% worker capacity. All businesses will have to comply with tight standard operating procedures (SOPs) and all local authority directives.\n\nCar sales have of course stopped during the two-week period, as well as that for vehicle inspections and registrations, as both Puspakom and the road transport department (JPJ) have announced that no business will be done during the lockdown.

According to the statement released by the ministry yesterday, customers can only stay in retail stores or shopping malls for a maximum duration of two hours once the new directive is put in place tomorrow.\n\nSo, who will be responsible for monitoring this time limit? Based on another document that was released earlier today, the responsibility falls on the retail store and shopping mall operators themselves.

ProtectHealth Corporation \u2013 a Ministry of Health (MOH) owned company whose board includes the Health director-general and MOH secretary-general \u2013 and the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) \u2013 which appears to oversee the so-called \u201ceconomic frontliners vaccination programme\u201d for the retail sector \u2013 have denied collecting payments for the vaccine rollouts by shopping centres.\n\nSo, what are shopping centres collecting the money for? If ProtectHealth is already covering the cost of vaccine administration by paying vaccinators RM14 per dose administered, is the RM50 fee to cover the cost of venue rental for setting up vaccination centres (PPVs) at malls? Even then, this seems excessive.\n\nPharmaniaga Bhd, on the other hand, is expected to immediately deliver Sinovac\u2019s coronavirus vaccines to state governments and the private sector, despite Vaccine Minister Khairy Jamaluddin\u2019s previous assertion that the federal government\u2019s order of 12 million doses must be fulfilled in its entirety \u2013 estimated end July \u2013 before Pharmaniaga begins work on other orders.\n\nWith Health Minister Dr Adham Baba and Senior Defence Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob\u2019s latest statement yesterday (Pharmaniaga is controlled by the Armed Forces Fund Board) on Pharmaniaga\u2019s vaccine distribution to states and companies running parallel with PICK, it is unclear if Pharmaniaga can fully deliver the federal government\u2019s order by the end-July target.\n\nWhy is CITF diverting Covid-19 vaccines away from PICK when we have inoculated just a fraction of the 9.4 million targeted individuals who face the highest risk of developing severe disease or dying from Covid-19 \u2013 the elderly, people with comorbidities, and the disabled community?\n\nAs of May 31, just about two million people have received at least one dose of the vaccine. Assuming that about a million of these individuals are frontline workers from the first phase of PICK and young adults who signed up for the AstraZeneca-Oxford jab (numbers are likely higher), that means Malaysia has vaccinated only a million high-risk individuals, or 11 per cent of the 9.4 million targeted.\n\nCITF has yet to publish statistics on the number of high-risk people who have received Covid-19 vaccines so far.\n\nIn the month of May alone, 1,290 people lost their lives to Covid-19 in Malaysia, nearly triple the 471 fatalities recorded in the whole of last year. Although an increasing number of younger adults are dying from Covid-19 in the new wave of the Malaysian epidemic, the elderly remain the primary victims.\n\nAbout 74 per cent of 1,290 people who died from Covid-19 last month, or 955 individuals, were aged 60 years and above. Nearly nine in 10 victims had underlying health conditions, 75 per cent of whom were aged 60 or older.\n\nDozens of people have been dying from Covid-19 every day in Malaysia in the past three weeks. When hospitals and intensive care units (ICUs) are full, our vaccination strategy should focus on reducing the number of people with Covid-19 requiring hospital or critical care, not to cut infections.\n\nPeople who receive vaccination can still contract Covid-19 and possibly infect others, but all approved coronavirus vaccines prevent severe disease and death.\n\nChasing illusory single-digit daily infections \u2013 or even triple-digit infections at this point \u2013 is an impossible endeavour that will take at least six months or even a year, depending on how fast we can inoculate two-thirds of our adult population. As of yesterday, only about 8 per cent of Malaysia\u2019s adult population has received at least one dose.\n\nIf CITF is now changing its vaccination strategy to focus on working adults to prevent further economically devastating lockdowns, then CITF should make this clear. In a scenario with limited resources \u2013 vaccine supply, manpower to run PPVs, and outreach efforts \u2013 there must be priority groups in whichever strategy, whether it\u2019s to protect the most vulnerable or to keep the economy going.\n\nThe UK recorded zero new Covid-19 deaths yesterday for the first time since July 2020. This achievement came after the UK took about six months to vaccinate nearly 75 per cent of the adult population, or over 39 million people, with at least one vaccine dose.\n\nThe UK\u2019s coronavirus vaccination programme, which opened up in phases according to age, hit its target of offering a first jab to all those in top priority groups \u2013 those aged 50 or older as well as people in high-risk categories \u2013 before April 15.\n\nEngland and Scotland have now started offering first vaccines to people aged 30 and above, while Northern Ireland and Wales have begun vaccinating over-18s. Due to the emergence of the variant first discovered in India, renamed the \u201cDelta\u201d variant, England is accelerating second vaccine doses to adults aged 50 and above.\n\nThe UK has the benefit of most residents, including non-nationals, being registered with its NHS, making it easy to reach out to senior citizens for Covid-19 vaccination. Malaysia, on the other hand, has serious challenges in providing vaccine access to the elderly, many of whom live in the community with their families or on their own instead of care homes.\n\nThe over 62,000 no-shows at Covid-19 vaccination appointments in Kedah, Pahang, Kelantan, Perak, Negeri Sembilan, Melaka, Perlis, and Terengganu \u2013 attributed to lack of transport to PPVs and not checking the MySejahtera app for appointment dates \u2013 illustrate the immense difficulty in reaching the elderly population.\n\nBut this does not mean the government should abandon senior citizens and switch focus to easier targets.

Covid-19 vaccinations onsite at shopping malls for participating retail tenants is not profiteering, the Malaysia Shopping Malls Association (PPK Malaysia) said today.\n\nInstead, the association representing shopping malls claimed that the actual estimated cost for logistics and the health personnel needed to administer the Covid-19 vaccines could go up to RM100 and even RM150, and that the malls had actually decided to subsidise the cost with plans to only collect RM50.\n\nPPK Malaysia was speaking of the plans to have onsite Covid-19 vaccination at shopping malls for employees of retail outlets in the malls, through a \u201cpublic-private sector partnership\u201d model.\n\nWhile confirming that the Covid-19 vaccines will be provided by the Malaysian government for free under this partnership PPK Malaysia said shopping malls will be paying for the fees for doctors, nurses and medical officers to Health Ministry-owned ProtectHealth Corporation and all other antecedent costs.\n\nEarlier this week, notices had circulated on social media of purported plans by shopping malls to offer Covid-19 vaccination to retail tenants\u2019 staff at RM50 per person for two doses (with some giving a breakdown of RM15 for administration per dose and RM10 for logistics per dose).\n\nPPK Malaysia said the planned collection of RM50 was meant partly to secure commitment by retail staff to ensure that they would show up for the vaccination, as well as to pay for the services of administering the Covid-19 vaccine to be provided by the private healthcare providers coordinated by ProtectHealth Corporation.\n\n\u201cOur Association members estimated that the cost of providing the venue, logistics, manpower, standby ambulance service etc for the on-site vaccination centre will amount to RM100 to RM150 per pax, depending on volume and total number of doses available each day, the total population to be vaccinated and the duration to complete all the doses.\n\n\u201cIn the interests of the national agenda, it was decided that the malls shall largely subsidise these costs and be allowed to charge merely RM10 x 2 doses = RM20 per pax to partially defray their expenses and as a commitment by the registrant so as to mitigate absenteeism, leading to wastage of vaccines which would otherwise could be administered to those yet to be scheduled and in order to reach herd immunity of the community in the shortest possible time.\n\n\u201cWe were also informed that the doctors and nurses providing their service will be allocated by the Protect Health Corporation who will charge to administer per dose at RM15.\n\n\u201cTherefore, at RM15 per dose x 2 doses equalling RM30, plus the above nominal sum of RM20 to partially defray logistic expenses, a total of RM50 for 2 doses will be charged to participants, principally only our shopping frontliners,\u201d the shopping malls association explained in a statement today.\n\nCovid-19 vaccination urgently needed, speed is key\n\nIn the same statement, PPK Malaysia said it appreciates shopping malls for recognising the need to subsidise the Covid-19 vaccination costs for retail frontliners, in order to protect the retail industry through immunisation and as an overall corporate social responsibility (CSR) contribution towards the national agenda of urgently achieving herd immunity.\n\n\u201cIt has been proven in several overseas countries that the speed of vaccinations is the way to bring down the rate of infections, coupled with self-discipline and strict adherence to SOPs instead of prolonging the need for further MCOs,\u201d it said, referring to the movement control orders (MCO) in the country.\n\nNoting that the Covid-19 vaccination for the public is being planned on a different schedule, the association said the primary purpose for the partnership with the government was to vaccinate all employees of shopping malls and malls\u2019 business outlets, adding that it is believed that the malls would be \u201cmuch safer places for the public to shop with confidence and with peace of mind\u201d once such vaccination is carried out.\n\n\u201cDespite our good intentions, we are distraught with the negative comments in the media that malls are profiteering from this exercise which is extremely far from the truth,\u201d it said, adding that this statement was issued in order to correct and put the record straight.\n\nIt noted that the \u201curgent need for access to vaccination\u201d was reflected in the shopping malls\u2019 \u201centhusiastic participation\u201d and the \u201coverwhelming registration\u201d by mall employees and mall tenants for the proposed onsite Covid-19 vaccination at malls.\n\n\u201cWe truly look forward to the success of this win-win collaboration with the authorities towards the national objective of achieving herd immunity urgently and the ultimate recovery of the economy in due course,\u201d the association said.\n\nEarlier in the statement, PPK Malaysia explained the reasoning for the idea of vaccinating mall tenants\u2019 staff onsite at shopping malls, while also providing updates on the progress of this plan.\n\nCiting the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi\u2019s May 28 announcement of plans to vaccinate an estimated 500,000 employees in the retail industry under the country\u2019s economic frontliners (retail sector) Covid-19 immunisation programme, PPK Malaysia said it lauded the government\u2019s targeting of the relevant economic sectors to speed up the Covid-19 vaccination programme.\n\n\u201cShopping malls together with all retail tenants\u2019 staff are effectively frontliners and we feel that it is imperative for the vaccination exercise to be implemented expeditiously. When vaccinated, our frontliners will not only protect themselves but more importantly, duly protect the shoppers and the public.\n\n\u201cWe are also appreciative that our proposal for on-site vaccination centres at shopping malls is adopted as it is more efficient and logical to bring the medical personnel to come on-site to administer the vaccinations instead of all the staff having to take time off work to travel to outside vaccination centres, thus interrupting business and daily operations,\u201d PPK Malaysia said.\n\nIn the May 28 statement by the KPDNHEP minister, he too had spoken of his ministry\u2019s cooperation with the Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) for the vaccination of \u201ceconomic frontliners\u201d in the retail sector expected to start in June, and had also spoke on discussions involving CITF on the same day with 60 representatives from the retail industry.\n\nThe minister had also on May 28 spoken of his ministry\u2019s cooperation with PPK Malaysia, the Malaysia Retailers Association (MRA), and Malaysia Retail Chain Association (MRCA) to establish Covid-19 vaccination centres (PPVs) at strategic locations nationwide, while also urging all retail companies to join this vaccination programme to help achieve the government\u2019s target of vaccinating 80 per cent of the population before the year ends.\n\nToday, PPK Malaysia said such an initiative in collaboration with the authorities has received \u201centhusiastic response\u201d from its members malls and retailers, noting that more than 50 malls have already notified their interest to host PPVs nationwide.\n\n\u201cDetails of this programme and the confirmed locations are being finalised and will be announced, once approved in due course, and we do look forward to the rollout by end of June 2021 onwards as scheduled,\u201d it said, having noted that it had already had several meetings with the authorities on this public-private sector partnership for Covid-19 vaccination.\n\nAbout ProtectHealth Corporation\n\nOn its website, ProtectHealth Corporation Sdn Bhd states that the not-for-profit company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Health Ministry\u2019s ProtectHealth Malaysia. It further states that it was appointed by the ministry to implement the participation of private medical practitioners in the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme.\n\nBased on information on ProtectHealth\u2019s website, private general practitioners do not need to pay to participate in the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme, but would have to receive training and also prepare their own personal protective equipment.\n\nThe website also states that ProtectHealth would pay general practitioners RM14 for their administration of each dose of Covid-19 vaccines through clinic and community outreach models, while payment of RM45 per hour would be paid to them for Covid-19 vaccination under government-organised mass vaccination models.\n\nProtectHealth Corporation denied collecting payments from shopping centres purportedly rolling out Covid-19 inoculation drives with vaccinators from ProtectHealth Corp.\n\n\u201cProtectHealth involvement remains the same for all vaccination centres. We pay private medical practitioners RM14 per dose administered,\u201d Khairul Faizi from the corporate communications unit of ProtectHealth Corp told CodeBlue today.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t supply vaccines as our role is managing the private medical practitioners. The vaccine supply is done by the government, similar to other vaccination centres.\u201d\n\nHealth news portal CodeBlue yesterday reported ProtectHealth Corporation as stating its role as merely managing the private medical practitioners carrying out Covid-19 vaccination work and that it pays RM14 per dose administered to such private healthcare personnel.\n\nCodeBlue yesterday also reported ProtectHealth Corporation as denying collecting payments from shopping malls for Covid-19 vaccination in collaboration with the company. \u2013 MalayMail", "keyword": ["shopping", "fee",

a landmark decision, the Intellectual Property High Court in Kuala Lumpur has declared that the sale, offer for sale, distribution and/or supply of TV Boxes or illicit streaming devices (ISDs) that can provide unauthorised access to copyrighted works, constitutes copyright infringement under the Copyright Act 1987.\n\nThe action in the Intellectual Property High Court was brought by satellite operator Measat Broadcast Networks, the service provider for Malaysian pay-TV platform Astro, against a seller of ISDs preloaded with applications which act as gateways to websites or content servers streaming pirated content.\n\nThe historic judgment, considered to be the first by the Intellectual Property High Court, is positively received by the authorities and industry players in their battle against digital piracy. Industry leaders including Astro laud the High Court\u2019s judgement as a bold step in the right direction against piracy in Malaysia.\n\n\u201cThe declaration by the High Court that sale of ISD which allows access to unauthorised copyright content amounts to copyright infringement sets a precedent for future civil claims on copyright infringement against ISD sellers in the market, including those on e-commerce platforms,\u201d stated Laila Saat, Director, Regulatory of Astro. \u201cThis ground-breaking declaration will strengthen intellectual property protection in the country and ongoing anti-piracy efforts, which are pivotal to ensure continuous investment and job creation in Malaysia\u2019s media and entertainment industry. We will continue to work with authorities and content partners to send a strong message that content piracy is theft, illegal and punishable by law.\u201d\n\n\u201cMCMC welcomes the court\u2019s decision, this will strengthen the legal aspects in protecting copyright infringement and battle against piracy, especially in digital and networked forms,\u201d added Zulkarnain Mohd Yasin, Chief Regulatory Officer of the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC).\n\n\u201cAcknowledging that more proactive action is needed to fight digital piracy in the country, FINAS expresses full support for legal action taken by Astro against ISD sellers and all digital piracy activities as these illegal activities has caused the local creative industry a huge loss in revenue every year,\u201d commented Dr. Ahmad Idham Ahmad Nadzri, CEO of the National Film Development Corporation Malaysia (FINAS). \u201cIn driving more holistic and effective strategy battling digital piracy, FINAS has established the Digital Piracy Eradication Committee with the collective support and involvement of relevant law enforcement agencies to further empower and strengthen enforcement, regulations and the terms of distribution licences in line with the provisions under the FINAS Act 244 1981\u201d.\n\n\u201cMyIPO looks forward for cases concerning ISDs to be brought forward to the Malaysian court,\u201d said Zulkarnain Muhammad, Deputy Director General of the Intellectual Property Corporation of Malaysia (MyIPO). \u201cPrevalent and widespread use of ISDs cause far more economic harm than physical copyright piracy. These devices are part of a wider network of online copyright piracy, which will in the long run disincentive original creators from producing creative work. Copyright piracy in any form should be curbed and deterred.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision is the correct one and we welcome it whole-heartedly,\u201d declared Louis Boswell, CEO of the Asia Video Industry Association (AVIA). \u201cContent is not made for free, and it is the right of creators and distributors to charge for it. To circumvent this and steal it is theft, and I see little difference between the theft of physical goods and the theft of video streams. As a society we need to do more to recognise theft for what it is and this ruling is a strong step in that direction.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is an important and welcome declaration by the Intellectual Property High Court, and sends a clear message that the sale of ISDs that provide unauthorised access to copyrighted works constitutes copyright infringement,\u201d asserted Kevin Plumb, Premier League Director of Legal Services. \u201cThe Premier League is committed to pursuing all those involved with providing illegal access to Premier League content as well as working to raise awareness of the risks fans face when watching via unauthorised sources. We will continue to work with Astro and local authorities as part of our ongoing anti-piracy programme in Malaysia.\u201d\n\nThe estimated loss to the industry and Malaysian economy due to piracy is over RM3 billion (\u20ac590m) annually with RM500 million in taxes and thousands of jobs at risk.\n\nThe declaration by the High Court follows recent criminal cases successfully brought against ISD retailers. On February 8th, a company director of an IT company was charged at the Shah Alam Sessions Court under Section 41 (1) (ha) of the Copyright Act 1987 with promoting Long TV Android boxes which allow the bypassing of technological protection measures on copyright broadcast work. On February 16th, a woman director of a mobile accessory company pleaded guilty to a charge of possessing TV media boxes that contains software to illegally stream Astro\u2019s content via the Internet. She was fined RM30,000 under Section 232(2) of the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998, making her the first ISD seller to be charged under this provision.\n\nThe Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) reiterated that it will take stern action against suppliers and sellers who misuse devices and software to illegally access content protected by their copyright work

Court in Luak, Miri on last Friday as blatant abuse of power and inhumane by the police.\n\nAccording to Aidi, a team from the Miri district police station was sent to the premises at around 9.30am after they received a public tip-off that the stalls there were serving dine-in breakfast to customers.\n\n\u201cAt the premises, the team witnessed that one of the stall operator was in the midst of preparing dine-in dishes for her customers,\u201d said Aidi.\n\nThe team also reported that upon realising the presence of the police, a few of the customers quickly left the premises and a worker quickly cleared-up the table.\n\nAidi said the premises had violated the current SOP of \u2018no dining-in\u2019 as the tables and chairs appeared to have been arranged for dine-in purposes.\n\n\u201cInside the premises, a man was sitting alone at a table and ignored the presence of the police. He also refused to cooperate with the team when questioned,\u201d said Aidi, adding that police had no choice but to issue him a compound.\n\nHe said it was only after the issuance of compound that the man claimed that he was a stall operator and voiced out his dissatisfaction for being issued with a compound.\n\nAidi said the stall operator, who was eating at a table in the premises, had indirectly encouraged other customers to dine-in at the premises.\n\n\u201cFurther checks on the stall operator revealed that he only has a business licence and not a licence from the Miri City Council,\u201d Aidi added.\n\nTherefore, he said what Ling had claimed in his statement was utterly wrong as evidence could be found from the premises\u2019 closed-circuit television (CCTV).\n\n\u201cFrom this, there was no blatant abuse of power and inhumane act by the police as claimed by Ling,\u201d Aidi added.\n\nThe owner of the premise is also urged to handover a copy of the CCTV footage to the police for further investigation under the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Act 1988.\n\nMeanwhile, Aidi said the police are working together with the government in the fight to break the infection chain of the Covid-19 virus in Sarawak.\n\n\u201cThe infection rate of the virus in Sarawak is worrying and everyone is urged to abide to the SOP as set by the Malaysian National Security Council,\u201d he added.", "keyword": ["aidi", "dinein", "senator", "team", "claim", "sop", "abuse", "stall", "miri", "statement", "operator", "act", "premises", "denies", "power", "lings", "chief"], "summary": "\u201cAt the premises, the team witnessed that one of the stall operator was in the midst of preparing dine-in dishes for her customers,\u201d said Aidi.\nHe said it was only after the issuance of compound that the man claimed that he was a stall operator and voiced out his dissatisfaction for being issued with a compound.\nAidi said the stall operator, who was eating at a table in the premises, had indirectly encouraged other customers to dine-in at the premises.\n\u201cFurther checks on the stall operator revealed that he only has a business licence and not a licence from the Miri City Council,\u201d Aidi added.\n\u201cFrom this, there was no blatant abuse of power and inhumane act by the police as claimed by Ling,\u201d Aidi added.", "news": "The Borneo Post", "date": "2021-05-23 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Lead example, Lo tells politicians in curbing Covid-19 pandemic", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWJvcm5lb3Bvc3QuY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvMjIvbGVhZC1leGFtcGxlLWxvLXRlbGxzLXBvbGl0aWNpYW5zLWluLWN1cmJpbmctY292aWQtMTktcGFuZGVtaWMv0gEA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2019/04/Andrew-Lo.jpeg", "text": "KUCHING (May 22): The Malaysian Trade Union Congress (MTUC) Sarawak has demanded for leadership by example in efforts to flatten the Covid-19 pandemic curve in the country.\n\nIts secretary Andrew Lo said until and unless the national and state political leaders step up and demonstrate leadership by example, Malaysia, including Sarawak, will not see an end to the Covid-19 pandemic any time soon.\n\nHe said MTUC Sarawak was quite amused by the Prime Minister\u2019s announcement that the National Security Council will tighten enforcement of the Movement Control Order (MCO) 3.0.\n\nThe Prime Minister, he noted, had inadvertently admitted that there had been loose enforcement the past 15 months.\n\n\u201cMTUC certainly does not condone any non-compliance of the standard operating procedures (SOP) and MCO.\n\n\u201cHowever we must question the many cases of Ministers and very important peoples (VIPs) that appears not to follow these restrictions and got off with a slap of the wrist, at most.\n\n\u201cWe even have Minister that was out of the country for weeks.

Could it be that PBS, just like Warisan, had also rejected Kitingan\u2019s overtures to officially join PN?\u201d he said in a statement today.\n\nKitingan, who heads STAR, a PN component party, had earlier today said he was open to the idea of opposition party Warisan joining the ruling coalition.\n\nThe Keningau MP said STAR was open to the idea and believed everybody should be invited into PN, including Warisan.\n\n\u201cThey have assemblymen who want to serve their constituencies. So, why not do this together?\n\n\u201cGRS is open (to the idea) and we have discussed it actually. Even the chief minister is open to it,\u201d Kitingan said.\n\nAlthough Warisan has rejected Kitingan\u2019s offer, the party has not, however, addressed the invitation initially made by PBS president Maximus Ongkili to join PN.\n\nOngkili had yesterday clarified remarks he made that he was willing to work with any opposition party, including Warisan.\n\nOngkili said his actual intention was to express PBS\u2019 openness to have Warisan cooperate with the state and federal governments to achieve their common development goals for the good of Sabah and Sabahans.\n\nIn his statement today, Siambun said Kitingan should realise that Warisan president Shafie Apdal\u2019s reply on his preference to work with PBS was merely a response to a question by a journalist on whether there had been any discussion with other parties on a potential partnership.\n\n\u201cShafie\u2019s preference to work with PBS was because it shares similar struggles for Sabahans as Warisan and that Ongkili is a long-time personal friend of Shafie and a consistent advocate on Sabah\u2019s rights as well.\n\n\u201cPBS is also a state-based party that had been consistent throughout these years since its formation and had been a victim of party-hopping,\u201d he said, referring to the fall of the PBS government after the state elections in 1994.\n\nSiambun also pointed out that the unique position held by PBS in the government allows it to determine the course and direction of the party without being dictated by others.\n\n\u201cPBS is not an official component member of Barisan Nasional or PN but only supports the government of the day. The support we give is contingent upon ensuring the Malaysia Agreement 1963 is wholly implemented.\n\n\u201cThis could be the reason why Ongkili was given the task to helm the Sabah and Sarawak affairs ministry in the Prime Minister\u2019s Department,\u201d he said.\n\nSiambun also said Warisan did not wish to be associated with PAS that had rejected a bill to amend Article 1(2) of the Federal Constitution.\n\nThe bill was intended to reinstate Sabah and Sarawak to their original status prior to a 1976 constitutional amendment.\n\nHe said Kitingan, whose STAR party is a formal member of PN, also worked closely with PAS, which had outrightly rejected the bill initiated by the late Liew Vui Keong, the former de facto law minister.\n\nHe said Kitingan should clarify why he is willing to work with PAS which has a nominated assemblyman in the Sabah state assembly now.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["open", "laughs", "party", "work", "warisan", "state", "pbs", "pn", "join", "invitation", "kitingan", "rejected", "jeffreys"], "summary": "KOTA KINABALU: State opposition party Warisan has declined an invitation by Perikatan Nasional deputy chairman Jeffrey Kitingan to join the ruling coalition, saying the invite was \u201chumorous\u201d.\nCould it be that PBS, just like Warisan, had also rejected Kitingan\u2019s overtures to officially join PN?\u201d he said in a statement today.\nKitingan, who heads STAR, a PN component party, had earlier today said he was open to the idea of opposition party Warisan joining the ruling coalition.\nThe Keningau MP said STAR was open to the idea and believed everybody should be invited into PN, including Warisan.\nAlthough Warisan has rejected Kitingan\u2019s offer, the party has not, however, addressed the invitation initially made by PBS president Maximus Ongkili to join PN.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-05-21 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "AirAsia\u2019s digital businesses to become Asean\u2019s leading super app", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWFsYXlzaWFucmVzZXJ2ZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNS8yOC9haXJhc2lhcy1kaWdpdGFsLWJ1c2luZXNzZXMtdG8tYmVjb21lLWFzZWFucy1sZWFkaW5nLXN1cGVyLWFwcC_SAW5odHRwczovL3RoZW1hbGF5c2lhbnJlc2VydmUuY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvMjgvYWlyYXNpYXMtZGlnaXRhbC1idXNpbmVzc2VzLXRvLWJlY29tZS1hc2VhbnMtbGVhZGluZy1zdXBlci1hcHAvYW1wLw?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://themalaysianreserve.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/AIRASIA-APP.jpg", "text": "By AZALEA AZUAR / Pic credit: airasia.com\n\nAirAsia Group Bhd\u2019s non-airline digital businesses is on the right track to becoming Asean\u2019s digital travel and lifestyle platform as it meets strong consumer demands.\n\nIts super app is now considered one of the region\u2019s top three online travel agencies (OTA) while AirAsia\u2019s e-wallet BigPay is set to become the first virtual bank and its delivery service Teleport is strengthening.\n\nDuring the group\u2019s first quarter of 2021 (1Q21) financial performance announcement on May 27, AirAsia super app posted a 45% year-on-year (YoY) increase in its revenue to RM10 million supported by solid growth of products and services available on the platform.\n\nTeleport\u2019s revenue has also tripled compared to its 1Q20 performance.\n\nAccording to AirAsia Group CEO Tan Sri Tony Fernandes, just as they revolutionised air travel 20 years ago with their low-cost carrier, AirAsia is now disrupting and democratising the lifestyle industry again through the development of their super app with over 17 travel and products leveraging off one another.\n\n\u201cIn just over a year we are now one of the top three leading online travel agencies (OTAs) in Asean based on website traffic, with over 100 million average page views monthly on airasia.com.\n\n\u201cIn the future, when travel resumes in our key markets, we can guarantee best value prices for our flight and hotel packages because we own our own airline,\u201d he explained in a press release today.\n\nExpansion of its popular products and services to its Asean markets for its super app is in AirAsia\u2019s pipeline.\n\n\u201cWe are working on expanding our health services in Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines, while offering SNAP hotel and accommodation deals in Vietnam and Singapore in the near future,\u201d said Fernandes.\n\nHe also said that Teleport not only provides the usual deliveries but has now been delivering vaccines all over Malaysia and the Asean region. Hence, it has created more than 4,000 delivery driver jobs in 17 key markets.\n\n\u201cWe are also looking forward to converting passenger planes into freighters in the coming months to cater for unprecedented cargo demand,\u201d he said.\n\nFernandes added that the group has plans to improve its BigPay e-wallet to become the best virtual bank in Asean.\n\n\u201cWe are tapping into the full potential of our loyalty platform BIG Rewards, to provide the best range for rewards and redemption in Asean and beyond.\n\n\u201cThrough our digital ecosystem, we have already created thousands of jobs and supported more than 3,500 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Malaysia.\n\n\u201cOur training centre, AirAsia Academy (currently known as Redbeat Academy), offers affordable digital and tech training courses to equip not only our own employees, but also SMEs and members of the public, with skills to bridge the technology gap in Malaysia and beyond in this ever changing digital world,\u201d he said.\n\nApart from AirAsia\u2019s digital services, its other non-airline businesses such as AirAsia Food, AirAsia Fresh, AirAsia Shop and its Santan franchise restaurants are also penetrating into new markets.\n\n\u201cAs we continue to expand our digital footprint in Malaysia and other Asean countries, our contribution in the region will only increase and become more significant from here onwards.\n\n\u201cWe saw the crisis as an opportunity to use the downtime in flying caused by the pandemic to leverage the strength of our database of over 60 million customers and to focus on developing new non airline revenue streams in the key areas of e-commerce, fintech and logistics,\u201d Fernandes commented.\n\nAirAsia has more innovations to roll out such as the ride-hailing \u201cAirAsia Ride\u201d, which will be launched in the coming months, as well as the potential of drone delivery.\n\nThe group is also planning for electric or hydronic aeroplanes to meet consumer\u2019s sustainability needs.\n\n\u201cIn the airline business, Asia Digital Engineering (ADE) is set to become one of the region\u2019s best value aircraft maintenance and overhaul providers for both short term line maintenance and longer-term base maintenance, a space previously dominated by Singapore-based maintenance and overhaul companies (MROs).\n\n\u201cI firmly believe ADE will become the leading aircraft maintenance/overhaul company in the region in the near future with significant potential growth opportunities in Asean and beyond with service excellence and the lowest cost base,\u201d he said.\n\nAirAsia is also working to launch more contactless technologies to make flying a seamless and hygienic experience when it resumes.\n\nThis includes a digital passport called Scan2Fly where passengers can upload required medical documentation and have it verified in real time online, before heading to the airport.\n\nThe group would also be introducing FACES, its biometric facial recognition technology at Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2 (KLIA 2) and it will be rolled out across all key destinations.\n\n\u201cThere is a silver lining to every crisis and the best thing to come out of this pandemic is our recovery as a stronger, more resilient travel and lifestyle platform \u2013 not solely reliant on airfares alone anymore,\u201d said Fernandes.\n\nThe \u201cnew look\u201d AirAsia would be embarking on an exciting new phase of growth, with the right focus and foundations to better meet the needs of the digital revolution.\n\nFernandes stressed that they would remain true to their promise of delivering high quality service serving the underserved by making it affordable to fly, stay, shop, eat and upskill.\n\n\u201cLooking out for the everyday people is what we do best and we aim to continue to support them, not only in the major cities, but also in the smaller cities we serve, where many people are struggling the most and access to products and services are more limited.\u201d", "keyword": ["asean", "maintenance", "aseans", "travel", "services", "super", "app", "airasias", "airasia",

open and detailed revelation of an intrusion by China\u2019s air force has raised many questions that the government needs to answer, says an expert in defence and diplomacy matters.\n\n\u201cThe biggest question is how the government, in particular Wisma Putra, is going to resolve it?\u201d asked the expert, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nThe expert said, however, that the RMAF\u2019s \u201cextremely rare\u201d move to reveal details of the incident which saw its fighter jets being scrambled to intercept 16 People\u2019s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) planes in Malaysia\u2019s maritime zone (ZMM), provided a \u201cgolden opportunity\u201d for the country.\n\nThe source said while the possibility that the PLAAF was carrying out surveillance in the area could not be ruled out, the Chinese could also have been \u201ctesting the waters\u201d over Malaysia\u2019s air defence systems and its reaction.\n\nThe \u201cbreach of Malaysian airspace and sovereignty\u201d \u2013 as foreign affairs minister Hishammuddin Hussein termed it \u2013 by the Chinese aircraft is the latest in a series of actions by China in the disputed South China Sea that has its neighbours worried.\n\nFor years, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei, Taiwan and Vietnam have been contesting China\u2019s claim to almost all of the South China Sea. These countries have often protested against China over what they claimed were intrusions into their territories.\n\nIn recent years, the dispute over the sea has seen a rise in tensions not only between China and these nations but also between China and the US. As recent as May 20, China and the US exchanged strong words over US naval activity in the region.\n\nThe expert asked what the rules of engagement would have been had the Chinese planes not turned back when the RMAF scrambled its jets.\n\n\u201cTypically, when an air force is confronted with such a situation, they would fire a warning shot or resort to aggressive manoeuvres to \u2018force\u2019 the foreign planes to turn back. Were our Hawks armed for engagement? How many Hawks were deployed?\n\n\u201cMy question is why did we scramble our Hawk 208 fighters? Those are advanced trainer jets, light fighter jets. They do not have the same interception capabilities of our Sukhoi Su-30MKM or F/A-18 Hornets.\n\n\u201cAre they airworthy? Or were the Hawks deployed because they are closest to that part of the South China Sea? If so, why are we not stationing more advanced fighters closer to the region?\u201d\n\nHe commended Hishammuddin for saying Wisma Putra would summon the Chinese ambassador to explain the incident.\n\nThe Chinese, the expert said, had already said the flight by the 16 planes was routine training and that it had not entered any other country\u2019s territorial air space under international law.\n\n\u201cEssentially, the Chinese are saying they have done nothing wrong. But Wisma Putra wants an explanation on the breach of Malaysian airspace and sovereignty.\n\n\u201cSo who is telling the truth? And what happens next? Will China apologise? I doubt they will, given their stance on the South China Sea.\u201d\n\nThe expert said if Wisma Putra was not satisfied with China\u2019s explanation and if the country refused to apologise, Malaysia should take the \u201cbold\u201d step of expelling the Chinese ambassador and recalling the Malaysian ambassador in China.\n\n\u201cIn diplomatic lexicon, expelling an ambassador is a very serious statement. I think if we do not do so, we (Malaysia) run the risk of looking weak.\u201d\n\nStill, the expert said, the incident provided Malaysia with the \u201cgolden opportunity\u201d to analyse and address defence issues, including the placement of frontline fighter jets and pattern of violations by foreign forces, particularly in the hotly disputed South China Sea.\n\nMeanwhile, defence analyst Lam Choong Wah said Asean and China were currently negotiating a code of conduct (CoC) for the South China Sea and that these negotiations needed to be sped up to regulate the behaviour of military operations in the region.\n\n\u201cMalaysia should utilise all available diplomatic channels to handle the issue to preserve national interests,\u201d Lam said.\n\n\u201cBeing firm or soft is not the crux of the problem. The core issue is there is no CoC in place to regulate military behavior in disputed areas, and until there is a CoC, military or maritime enforcement standoffs will take place from time to time.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["expert", "force", "wisma", "planes", "south", "malaysian", "chinese", "jets", "chinas", "intrusion", "putrajaya", "resolve", "sea", "putra"], "summary": "\u201cThe biggest question is how the government, in particular Wisma Putra, is going to resolve it?\u201d asked the expert, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.\nFor years, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei, Taiwan and Vietnam have been contesting China\u2019s claim to almost all of the South China Sea.\nThe expert asked what the rules of engagement would have been had the Chinese planes not turned back when the RMAF scrambled its jets.\n\u201cTypically, when an air force is confronted with such a situation, they would fire a warning shot or resort to aggressive manoeuvres to \u2018force\u2019 the foreign planes to turn back.\nBut Wisma Putra wants an explanation on the breach of Malaysian airspace and sovereignty.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-06-03 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Take more from KWAN to help M40, B40 groups, says Najib", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wNi8wMi90YWtlLW1vcmUtZnJvbS1rd2FuLXRvLWhlbHAtbTQwLWI0MC1ncm91cHMtc2F5cy1uYWppYi_SAQA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Fmt Reporters"], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/02-PANIC-BUYING-MC0-3.0.jpg", "text": "PETALING JAYA: Former prime minister Najib Razak has urged the government to take another RM4.2 billion from the National Trust Fund (KWAN) to assist the (bottom 40) B40 and (middle 40) M40 groups during the total lockdown.\n\nIn a Facebook post, he assured that Barisan Nasional would replenish the funds in the future.\n\nNajib also questioned if the current allocation of RM100 each for single Malaysians and RM500 for each B40 household with at least three children was sufficient.\n\n\u201cOn top of that, this assistance comes after they have faced MCO 2.0 and MCO 3.0/3.1 for five months, and now the total lockdown,\u201d he said.\n\nNajib noted that the payments would only come in by the end of June, while the additional RM500 for the Prihatin Special Grant (GKP) recipients was due in July.\n\nHe added that GKP recipients should also be eligible for Bantuan Prihatin Rakyat, as they had the additional burden of bearing the losses faced by their businesses.\n\nNajib said the Perikatan Nasional administration could dip into KWAN again if it wished to avoid borrowing more money, since it had already borrowed over RM100 billion for BPR aid within the first five months of the year.\n\nWith the additional funds from KWAN, Najib said, more could be handed out under the Bantuan Prihatin aid scheme.\n\n\u201cThe RM300 to RM500 will become RM900 to RM1,500 for B40 families.

It\u2019s sad at first, but whatever happened, happened and it\u2019s best to move on and be strong,\u201d said the 33-year-old content creator from Selangor, when we spoke on Sunday (30 May).\n\nFahmi had been confirmed positive with Covid-19 after getting tested at the Covid Assessment Centre (CAC) in Stadium Melawati, Shah Alam on 21 May. That same day, he was sent straight to the PKRC to undergo more than a week of mandatory quarantine.\n\n\u201cI have three days to go. They count it from the day you first did your swab test and 10 days after that.\u201d he explained, mentioning how all of his close contacts were fortunate enough to have not contracted the virus.\n\nSharing his experiences, Fahmi revealed how his body had reacted over the course of his infection.\n\nMy symptoms came in pretty late, each day one symptom. First came the sore throat, fever the day after, then I started to lose my sense of smell and taste, then I started to feel heavy breathing and panting. But nothing serious. That\u2019s why they sent me to MAEPS because here they have the equipment to scan my lungs.\n\nFahmi also said that the medical staff stationed at the PKRC had been very reliable and responsive to his needs and everyone else who\u2019s there.\n\nQuarantine life\n\nWith thousands of other Covid-19 patients confined together at the \u2018DG Hall\u2019 in MAEPS, Fahmi noted his shock when first arriving at the PKRC and said that quarantine life took some getting used to.\n\n\u201cI was of course surprised by the insane number of people here, to the point that there are not enough beds. People have to sleep on mattresses on the floor,\u201d he said, adding that without any appropriate shower facility there, patients also have to contend with long bathroom lines and having to bathe on the toilet.\n\nHowever, despite the minor discomforts, Fahmi said everything at the PKRC had been satisfactory and personally relates life in quarantine to what people might find in boarding schools.\n\n\u201cFood is served three times a day. Breakfast is at 8 am, lunch at 12 noon and dinner at 6 pm.

The key to surviving here is to just make friends to keep yourself sane.\n\nWith the time spent living with a deadly disease and after having been in the Covid-19 isolation camp, Fahmi said that the best way to overcome it all is with positive thinking and not giving up.\n\nI was scared, anything could happen and I was afraid I wasn\u2019t going to come back.

Let\u2019s find out.\n\nThe phone looks pretty good on the back too, so when you\u2019re taking pictures of other people at least they\u2019ll be looking towards you. (Credit: TRP)\n\nA phone catered to selfie enthusiasts\n\nAs advertised by the company, the V21\u2019s main selling point has to be its selfie camera with tonnes of options for you to play with such as adjusting brightness all the way, to toning your cheeks.\n\nAnd apparently, having nifty software tricks is not enough for the Chinese manufacturer as the phone is also fitted with \u2013 wait for it \u2013 two built-in flashlights which the company calls Dual Selfie Spotlight located on the front of the phone.\n\nYou know, just in case you\u2019re in a really, really, dark room and thought that this might be the best time to take a selfie.\n\nCredit: TRP\n\nThe V21 can even guide you on how to take a good selfie \u2013 complete with outlines showing you how to pose and take the shot.\n\nThe back camera is pretty good too if you\u2019re under good sunlight and it has three different lenses for you to choose from.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good in the hand and it\u2019s pretty too\n\nAlthough this phone has a screen size of 6.44 inches, the phone actually feels good in the hand and isn\u2019t super huge thanks to a design that stretches the panel out to the edge of the phone.\n\nIf you\u2019re a bit conservative and want your phone to blend in the background, there\u2019s the Dusk Blue colour option, but if you want it to get everyone\u2019s attention including your own, there\u2019s also Sunset Dazzle which is a real looker.\n\nThe colours on the body of the phone shift when you look at it from different angles which might entice some folks who want their phone to have a slightly funkier colour palette rather than having it just plain old black or white.\n\nCredit: TRP\n\nAll day phone\n\nThe Vivo V21 has quite a slim profile but don\u2019t think that it\u2019s not beefed up in the battery department because the phone can last you a full day even if you\u2019re consuming a lot of content.\n\nThere\u2019s also the option of fast charging if you manage to drain that big battery and they\u2019re not messing about. It\u2019s actually possible to get this thing from 0 to roughly above 50% within half an hour.\n\nCredit: TRP\n\nNot really a gaming phone\n\nThe phone might tick many boxes but gaming is not one of them.\n\nYes, you can play graphic intensive games like COD Mobile or PUBG Mobile, but I noticed that the V21 doesn\u2019t allow you to max out the settings, which might be a dealbreaker for some but if you\u2019re playing casual games, it will work just fine.\n\nShould you get the V21?\n\nIt\u2019s a great phone if you\u2019re someone who likes to take a lot of selfies as this where the phone truly shines. Literally.\n\nThere are not many phones that can say that they have one, let alone two flashes for the front camera and the amount of options is great for those who want to tweak their selfies.\n\nApart from the front camera, the V21 is also capable in other areas such as having a great screen for watching stuff like YouTube or Netflix, a pretty design, and also a large battery with the option of fast charging that borders on ridiculous.\n\nThe Vivo V21 is an affordable package and that not only looks good, but it feels good to use too.\n\nCredit: TRP\n\nShare your thoughts with us via TRP\u2019s Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.", "keyword": ["really", "youre", "camera", "phone", "good", "v21", "pretty", "taking", "having", "selfies", "vivo", "selfie", "review", "option"], "summary": "Vivo recently came out with the V21, a phone that takes aim at those who like to take a lot of selfies.\nBut, is a selfie camera really enough to entice you to get this phone?\nThe phone looks pretty good on the back too, so when you\u2019re taking pictures of other people at least they\u2019ll be looking towards you.\nYou know, just in case you\u2019re in a really, really, dark room and thought that this might be the best time to take a selfie.\nIt\u2019s a great phone if you\u2019re someone who likes to take a lot of selfies as this where the phone truly shines.", "news": "The Rakyat Post", "date": "2021-06-02 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "We need to prepare for the worst, says health DG", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wNS8yNS93ZS1uZWVkLXRvLXByZXBhcmUtZm9yLXRoZS13b3JzdC1zYXlzLWhlYWx0aC1kZy_SAQA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/noor-hisham-abdullah-fmt-080521-2.jpg", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: Health director-general Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah urged the public to prepare for the worst in facing the Covid-19 wave following an exponential trend indicated by the Covid-19 graph in this country.\n\n\u201cThe rise in cases started from April 1 and could trigger a vertical surge.

assured the people of Kapit, Song, Bukit Mabong, and Belaga districts that there are sufficient supplies of essential food items throughout this Gawai Dayak season.\n\nThe ministry\u2019s Kapit chief Al-Redzamani Abdul Razak said 10 items have been listed under the Festive Season Maximum Price Control Scheme (SHMMP) for Gawai until June 3.\n\nThey are live chicken, standard chicken (slaughtered and cleaned with legs, heads, liver and giblets or any part thereof), super chicken (slaughtered and cleaned, without legs, head, liver and giblets), Grade A chicken eggs (weighing between 65g and 69.9g), Grade B chicken eggs (weighing between 60g and 64.9g each), Grade C chicken eggs (weighing between 55g and 59.9g each), live old chicken, chicken wings, pork (belly), and pork (meat and fat).\n\n\u201cBased on our regular inspection and also the feedback from both retailers and suppliers, the supply level is stable and should be sufficient to meet the demands.\n\n\u201cNonetheless, our KPDNHEP teams continue to closely supervise and monitor the selling and buying trends during the current Movement Control Order (MCO) period, as well as to ensure every trader comply strictly with the price-control scheme for Gawai 2021.\n\n\u201cWe aim to advocate a healthy business environment and a win-win situation between the traders and the consumers,\u201d Al Redzamani said in a statement.\n\nHe also warned stern action would await any trader caught raising the price of any of the controlled items during the SHMMP Gawai 2021 period.\n\n\u201cAny consumer who finds any trader not abiding by the scheme, or notices other unscrupulous trading practices, can lodge a report by calling our hotline 1-800-886-800, or send WhatsApp texts via 019-2794317.\n\n\u201cAlso, seek KPDNHEP on Facebook, or go to Kapit KPDNHEP Office behind Meligai Hotel, which is open from 8am to 5pm on every regular working day,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, a survey here yesterday showed many shoppers stocking up not only for the Gawai Dayak celebration, but also for the the statewide MCO, which takes effect today.\n\nThe Terasang Market, Pasar Tani Kapit, Kapit Night Street Market, cold storage, and various supermarkets were crowded with more customers than usual.\n\nA local resident, who wish to be identified only as \u2018Madam Chen\u2019, said her husband reminded her to buy extra vegetables and meat for their family\u2019s consumption over the next few days.\n\n\u201cI bought various green vegetables, some pork, and also fish \u2013- these should last us for the next few days.\n\n\u201cWe, the adults, do not mind much, but the children are the ones who need more food to grow,\u201d the housewife from Jalan Selirik said when met at Terasang Market yesterday.\n\nPenghulu Allan Tubam said he had spent most of his time at his longhouse throughout the various stages of MCO.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t come down to Kapit town, unless there\u2019s some urgent or official duties that have to be attended to.\n\n\u201cI believe in looking after myself and my family as much as possible. I want to protect them from Covid-19. As a community leader, I need to set a good example for my followers,\u201d he said, adding that he and other community leaders had come to get their Covid-19 vaccination.\n\n\u201cThis morning (yesterday), I took the opportunity to buy some extra food, some drinks before returning to my longhouse.\n\n\u201cWith the MCO taking effect on May 29, I wouldn\u2019t do any Gawai shopping.

Earlier today, we were told that Perodua\u2019s Sentral facility in Section 19, Petaling Jaya remained closed, including its after-sales department. According to a source, the company is expected to make an announcement on the matter soon.\n\nLikewise, Edaran Tan Chong Motor (ETCM) announced yesterday via a FB post that all Nissan workshops are temporarily closed, pending application for operation. The company has not yet updated the status of its after-sales activities as of this point.\n\nMeanwhile, Honda dealerships that have obtained approval for after-sales service to continue have begun doing so. However, we were told by a source that not all Honda service centres are operational at this point, although more dealerships are attempting to get approval to operate their SCs. Honda Malaysia had previously announced that it would continue offering after-sales services during the lockdown period.\n\nThis is also the case with workshops and parts businesses, as approval by authorities is needed to open for business. Relevant documents are also necessary to ensure staff meet the necessary travel protocols. With enforcement being reportedly strict, many businesses allowed to operate during the FMCO are choosing to remain closed until they can obtain the necessary approval letters.\n\nEarlier, domestic trade and consumer affairs (KPDNHEP) minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi had stated that service centres as well as vehicle repair (body and paint) facilities would be allowed to operate during the lockdown, at 60% worker capacity. All businesses will have to comply with tight standard operating procedures (SOPs) and all local authority directives.\n\nCar sales have of course stopped during the two-week period, as well as that for vehicle inspections and registrations, as both Puspakom and the road transport department (JPJ) have announced that no business will be done during the lockdown.

According to the statement released by the ministry yesterday, customers can only stay in retail stores or shopping malls for a maximum duration of two hours once the new directive is put in place tomorrow.\n\nSo, who will be responsible for monitoring this time limit? Based on another document that was released earlier today, the responsibility falls on the retail store and shopping mall operators themselves.

A brutal new wave of the Covid-19 epidemic killed a record high 1,290 people last month.\n\nPPK Malaysia\u2019s circular stated that a total of RM30 per person will be charged as administration fee (RM15 per dose) and another RM20 per person for logistic expenditure (RM10 per dose). The RM30 fee for two doses is supposedly paid to ProtectHealth Corporation, a company owned by the Ministry of Health (MOH) that manages private medical practitioners who sign up as vaccinators under PICK.\n\nCodeBlue contacted PPK Malaysia \u2014 which represents major shopping centres in the Klang Valley and other states \u2014 to verify the authenticity of the circular.

We pay private medical practitioners RM14 per dose administered,\u201d Khairul Faizi from the corporate communications unit of ProtectHealth Corp told CodeBlue today.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t supply vaccines as our role is managing the private medical practitioners.

ProtectHealth Corporation \u2013 a Ministry of Health (MOH) owned company whose board includes the Health director-general and MOH secretary-general \u2013 and the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) \u2013 which appears to oversee the so-called \u201ceconomic frontliners vaccination programme\u201d for the retail sector \u2013 have denied collecting payments for the vaccine rollouts by shopping centres.\n\nSo, what are shopping centres collecting the money for? If ProtectHealth is already covering the cost of vaccine administration by paying vaccinators RM14 per dose administered, is the RM50 fee to cover the cost of venue rental for setting up vaccination centres (PPVs) at malls? Even then, this seems excessive.\n\nPharmaniaga Bhd, on the other hand, is expected to immediately deliver Sinovac\u2019s coronavirus vaccines to state governments and the private sector, despite Vaccine Minister Khairy Jamaluddin\u2019s previous assertion that the federal government\u2019s order of 12 million doses must be fulfilled in its entirety \u2013 estimated end July \u2013 before Pharmaniaga begins work on other orders.\n\nWith Health Minister Dr Adham Baba and Senior Defence Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob\u2019s latest statement yesterday (Pharmaniaga is controlled by the Armed Forces Fund Board) on Pharmaniaga\u2019s vaccine distribution to states and companies running parallel with PICK, it is unclear if Pharmaniaga can fully deliver the federal government\u2019s order by the end-July target.\n\nWhy is CITF diverting Covid-19 vaccines away from PICK when we have inoculated just a fraction of the 9.4 million targeted individuals who face the highest risk of developing severe disease or dying from Covid-19 \u2013 the elderly, people with comorbidities, and the disabled community?\n\nAs of May 31, just about two million people have received at least one dose of the vaccine. Assuming that about a million of these individuals are frontline workers from the first phase of PICK and young adults who signed up for the AstraZeneca-Oxford jab (numbers are likely higher), that means Malaysia has vaccinated only a million high-risk individuals, or 11 per cent of the 9.4 million targeted.\n\nCITF has yet to publish statistics on the number of high-risk people who have received Covid-19 vaccines so far.\n\nIn the month of May alone, 1,290 people lost their lives to Covid-19 in Malaysia, nearly triple the 471 fatalities recorded in the whole of last year. Although an increasing number of younger adults are dying from Covid-19 in the new wave of the Malaysian epidemic, the elderly remain the primary victims.\n\nAbout 74 per cent of 1,290 people who died from Covid-19 last month, or 955 individuals, were aged 60 years and above. Nearly nine in 10 victims had underlying health conditions, 75 per cent of whom were aged 60 or older.\n\nDozens of people have been dying from Covid-19 every day in Malaysia in the past three weeks. When hospitals and intensive care units (ICUs) are full, our vaccination strategy should focus on reducing the number of people with Covid-19 requiring hospital or critical care, not to cut infections.\n\nPeople who receive vaccination can still contract Covid-19 and possibly infect others, but all approved coronavirus vaccines prevent severe disease and death.\n\nChasing illusory single-digit daily infections \u2013 or even triple-digit infections at this point \u2013 is an impossible endeavour that will take at least six months or even a year, depending on how fast we can inoculate two-thirds of our adult population. As of yesterday, only about 8 per cent of Malaysia\u2019s adult population has received at least one dose.\n\nIf CITF is now changing its vaccination strategy to focus on working adults to prevent further economically devastating lockdowns, then CITF should make this clear. In a scenario with limited resources \u2013 vaccine supply, manpower to run PPVs, and outreach efforts \u2013 there must be priority groups in whichever strategy, whether it\u2019s to protect the most vulnerable or to keep the economy going.\n\nThe UK recorded zero new Covid-19 deaths yesterday for the first time since July 2020. This achievement came after the UK took about six months to vaccinate nearly 75 per cent of the adult population, or over 39 million people, with at least one vaccine dose.\n\nThe UK\u2019s coronavirus vaccination programme, which opened up in phases according to age, hit its target of offering a first jab to all those in top priority groups \u2013 those aged 50 or older as well as people in high-risk categories \u2013 before April 15.\n\nEngland and Scotland have now started offering first vaccines to people aged 30 and above, while Northern Ireland and Wales have begun vaccinating over-18s. Due to the emergence of the variant first discovered in India, renamed the \u201cDelta\u201d variant, England is accelerating second vaccine doses to adults aged 50 and above.\n\nThe UK has the benefit of most residents, including non-nationals, being registered with its NHS, making it easy to reach out to senior citizens for Covid-19 vaccination. Malaysia, on the other hand, has serious challenges in providing vaccine access to the elderly, many of whom live in the community with their families or on their own instead of care homes.\n\nThe over 62,000 no-shows at Covid-19 vaccination appointments in Kedah, Pahang, Kelantan, Perak, Negeri Sembilan, Melaka, Perlis, and Terengganu \u2013 attributed to lack of transport to PPVs and not checking the MySejahtera app for appointment dates \u2013 illustrate the immense difficulty in reaching the elderly population.\n\nBut this does not mean the government should abandon senior citizens and switch focus to easier targets.

Covid-19 vaccinations onsite at shopping malls for participating retail tenants is not profiteering, the Malaysia Shopping Malls Association (PPK Malaysia) said today.\n\nInstead, the association representing shopping malls claimed that the actual estimated cost for logistics and the health personnel needed to administer the Covid-19 vaccines could go up to RM100 and even RM150, and that the malls had actually decided to subsidise the cost with plans to only collect RM50.\n\nPPK Malaysia was speaking of the plans to have onsite Covid-19 vaccination at shopping malls for employees of retail outlets in the malls, through a \u201cpublic-private sector partnership\u201d model.\n\nWhile confirming that the Covid-19 vaccines will be provided by the Malaysian government for free under this partnership PPK Malaysia said shopping malls will be paying for the fees for doctors, nurses and medical officers to Health Ministry-owned ProtectHealth Corporation and all other antecedent costs.\n\nEarlier this week, notices had circulated on social media of purported plans by shopping malls to offer Covid-19 vaccination to retail tenants\u2019 staff at RM50 per person for two doses (with some giving a breakdown of RM15 for administration per dose and RM10 for logistics per dose).\n\nPPK Malaysia said the planned collection of RM50 was meant partly to secure commitment by retail staff to ensure that they would show up for the vaccination, as well as to pay for the services of administering the Covid-19 vaccine to be provided by the private healthcare providers coordinated by ProtectHealth Corporation.\n\n\u201cOur Association members estimated that the cost of providing the venue, logistics, manpower, standby ambulance service etc for the on-site vaccination centre will amount to RM100 to RM150 per pax, depending on volume and total number of doses available each day, the total population to be vaccinated and the duration to complete all the doses.\n\n\u201cIn the interests of the national agenda, it was decided that the malls shall largely subsidise these costs and be allowed to charge merely RM10 x 2 doses = RM20 per pax to partially defray their expenses and as a commitment by the registrant so as to mitigate absenteeism, leading to wastage of vaccines which would otherwise could be administered to those yet to be scheduled and in order to reach herd immunity of the community in the shortest possible time.\n\n\u201cWe were also informed that the doctors and nurses providing their service will be allocated by the Protect Health Corporation who will charge to administer per dose at RM15.\n\n\u201cTherefore, at RM15 per dose x 2 doses equalling RM30, plus the above nominal sum of RM20 to partially defray logistic expenses, a total of RM50 for 2 doses will be charged to participants, principally only our shopping frontliners,\u201d the shopping malls association explained in a statement today.\n\nCovid-19 vaccination urgently needed, speed is key\n\nIn the same statement, PPK Malaysia said it appreciates shopping malls for recognising the need to subsidise the Covid-19 vaccination costs for retail frontliners, in order to protect the retail industry through immunisation and as an overall corporate social responsibility (CSR) contribution towards the national agenda of urgently achieving herd immunity.\n\n\u201cIt has been proven in several overseas countries that the speed of vaccinations is the way to bring down the rate of infections, coupled with self-discipline and strict adherence to SOPs instead of prolonging the need for further MCOs,\u201d it said, referring to the movement control orders (MCO) in the country.\n\nNoting that the Covid-19 vaccination for the public is being planned on a different schedule, the association said the primary purpose for the partnership with the government was to vaccinate all employees of shopping malls and malls\u2019 business outlets, adding that it is believed that the malls would be \u201cmuch safer places for the public to shop with confidence and with peace of mind\u201d once such vaccination is carried out.\n\n\u201cDespite our good intentions, we are distraught with the negative comments in the media that malls are profiteering from this exercise which is extremely far from the truth,\u201d it said, adding that this statement was issued in order to correct and put the record straight.\n\nIt noted that the \u201curgent need for access to vaccination\u201d was reflected in the shopping malls\u2019 \u201centhusiastic participation\u201d and the \u201coverwhelming registration\u201d by mall employees and mall tenants for the proposed onsite Covid-19 vaccination at malls.\n\n\u201cWe truly look forward to the success of this win-win collaboration with the authorities towards the national objective of achieving herd immunity urgently and the ultimate recovery of the economy in due course,\u201d the association said.\n\nEarlier in the statement, PPK Malaysia explained the reasoning for the idea of vaccinating mall tenants\u2019 staff onsite at shopping malls, while also providing updates on the progress of this plan.\n\nCiting the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi\u2019s May 28 announcement of plans to vaccinate an estimated 500,000 employees in the retail industry under the country\u2019s economic frontliners (retail sector) Covid-19 immunisation programme, PPK Malaysia said it lauded the government\u2019s targeting of the relevant economic sectors to speed up the Covid-19 vaccination programme.\n\n\u201cShopping malls together with all retail tenants\u2019 staff are effectively frontliners and we feel that it is imperative for the vaccination exercise to be implemented expeditiously. When vaccinated, our frontliners will not only protect themselves but more importantly, duly protect the shoppers and the public.\n\n\u201cWe are also appreciative that our proposal for on-site vaccination centres at shopping malls is adopted as it is more efficient and logical to bring the medical personnel to come on-site to administer the vaccinations instead of all the staff having to take time off work to travel to outside vaccination centres, thus interrupting business and daily operations,\u201d PPK Malaysia said.\n\nIn the May 28 statement by the KPDNHEP minister, he too had spoken of his ministry\u2019s cooperation with the Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) for the vaccination of \u201ceconomic frontliners\u201d in the retail sector expected to start in June, and had also spoke on discussions involving CITF on the same day with 60 representatives from the retail industry.\n\nThe minister had also on May 28 spoken of his ministry\u2019s cooperation with PPK Malaysia, the Malaysia Retailers Association (MRA), and Malaysia Retail Chain Association (MRCA) to establish Covid-19 vaccination centres (PPVs) at strategic locations nationwide, while also urging all retail companies to join this vaccination programme to help achieve the government\u2019s target of vaccinating 80 per cent of the population before the year ends.\n\nToday, PPK Malaysia said such an initiative in collaboration with the authorities has received \u201centhusiastic response\u201d from its members malls and retailers, noting that more than 50 malls have already notified their interest to host PPVs nationwide.\n\n\u201cDetails of this programme and the confirmed locations are being finalised and will be announced, once approved in due course, and we do look forward to the rollout by end of June 2021 onwards as scheduled,\u201d it said, having noted that it had already had several meetings with the authorities on this public-private sector partnership for Covid-19 vaccination.\n\nAbout ProtectHealth Corporation\n\nOn its website, ProtectHealth Corporation Sdn Bhd states that the not-for-profit company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Health Ministry\u2019s ProtectHealth Malaysia. It further states that it was appointed by the ministry to implement the participation of private medical practitioners in the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme.\n\nBased on information on ProtectHealth\u2019s website, private general practitioners do not need to pay to participate in the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme, but would have to receive training and also prepare their own personal protective equipment.\n\nThe website also states that ProtectHealth would pay general practitioners RM14 for their administration of each dose of Covid-19 vaccines through clinic and community outreach models, while payment of RM45 per hour would be paid to them for Covid-19 vaccination under government-organised mass vaccination models.\n\nProtectHealth Corporation denied collecting payments from shopping centres purportedly rolling out Covid-19 inoculation drives with vaccinators from ProtectHealth Corp.\n\n\u201cProtectHealth involvement remains the same for all vaccination centres. We pay private medical practitioners RM14 per dose administered,\u201d Khairul Faizi from the corporate communications unit of ProtectHealth Corp told CodeBlue today.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t supply vaccines as our role is managing the private medical practitioners. The vaccine supply is done by the government, similar to other vaccination centres.\u201d\n\nHealth news portal CodeBlue yesterday reported ProtectHealth Corporation as stating its role as merely managing the private medical practitioners carrying out Covid-19 vaccination work and that it pays RM14 per dose administered to such private healthcare personnel.\n\nCodeBlue yesterday also reported ProtectHealth Corporation as denying collecting payments from shopping malls for Covid-19 vaccination in collaboration with the company. \u2013 MalayMail", "keyword": ["shopping", "fee",

a landmark decision, the Intellectual Property High Court in Kuala Lumpur has declared that the sale, offer for sale, distribution and/or supply of TV Boxes or illicit streaming devices (ISDs) that can provide unauthorised access to copyrighted works, constitutes copyright infringement under the Copyright Act 1987.\n\nThe action in the Intellectual Property High Court was brought by satellite operator Measat Broadcast Networks, the service provider for Malaysian pay-TV platform Astro, against a seller of ISDs preloaded with applications which act as gateways to websites or content servers streaming pirated content.\n\nThe historic judgment, considered to be the first by the Intellectual Property High Court, is positively received by the authorities and industry players in their battle against digital piracy. Industry leaders including Astro laud the High Court\u2019s judgement as a bold step in the right direction against piracy in Malaysia.\n\n\u201cThe declaration by the High Court that sale of ISD which allows access to unauthorised copyright content amounts to copyright infringement sets a precedent for future civil claims on copyright infringement against ISD sellers in the market, including those on e-commerce platforms,\u201d stated Laila Saat, Director, Regulatory of Astro. \u201cThis ground-breaking declaration will strengthen intellectual property protection in the country and ongoing anti-piracy efforts, which are pivotal to ensure continuous investment and job creation in Malaysia\u2019s media and entertainment industry. We will continue to work with authorities and content partners to send a strong message that content piracy is theft, illegal and punishable by law.\u201d\n\n\u201cMCMC welcomes the court\u2019s decision, this will strengthen the legal aspects in protecting copyright infringement and battle against piracy, especially in digital and networked forms,\u201d added Zulkarnain Mohd Yasin, Chief Regulatory Officer of the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC).\n\n\u201cAcknowledging that more proactive action is needed to fight digital piracy in the country, FINAS expresses full support for legal action taken by Astro against ISD sellers and all digital piracy activities as these illegal activities has caused the local creative industry a huge loss in revenue every year,\u201d commented Dr. Ahmad Idham Ahmad Nadzri, CEO of the National Film Development Corporation Malaysia (FINAS). \u201cIn driving more holistic and effective strategy battling digital piracy, FINAS has established the Digital Piracy Eradication Committee with the collective support and involvement of relevant law enforcement agencies to further empower and strengthen enforcement, regulations and the terms of distribution licences in line with the provisions under the FINAS Act 244 1981\u201d.\n\n\u201cMyIPO looks forward for cases concerning ISDs to be brought forward to the Malaysian court,\u201d said Zulkarnain Muhammad, Deputy Director General of the Intellectual Property Corporation of Malaysia (MyIPO). \u201cPrevalent and widespread use of ISDs cause far more economic harm than physical copyright piracy. These devices are part of a wider network of online copyright piracy, which will in the long run disincentive original creators from producing creative work. Copyright piracy in any form should be curbed and deterred.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision is the correct one and we welcome it whole-heartedly,\u201d declared Louis Boswell, CEO of the Asia Video Industry Association (AVIA). \u201cContent is not made for free, and it is the right of creators and distributors to charge for it. To circumvent this and steal it is theft, and I see little difference between the theft of physical goods and the theft of video streams. As a society we need to do more to recognise theft for what it is and this ruling is a strong step in that direction.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is an important and welcome declaration by the Intellectual Property High Court, and sends a clear message that the sale of ISDs that provide unauthorised access to copyrighted works constitutes copyright infringement,\u201d asserted Kevin Plumb, Premier League Director of Legal Services. \u201cThe Premier League is committed to pursuing all those involved with providing illegal access to Premier League content as well as working to raise awareness of the risks fans face when watching via unauthorised sources. We will continue to work with Astro and local authorities as part of our ongoing anti-piracy programme in Malaysia.\u201d\n\nThe estimated loss to the industry and Malaysian economy due to piracy is over RM3 billion (\u20ac590m) annually with RM500 million in taxes and thousands of jobs at risk.\n\nThe declaration by the High Court follows recent criminal cases successfully brought against ISD retailers. On February 8th, a company director of an IT company was charged at the Shah Alam Sessions Court under Section 41 (1) (ha) of the Copyright Act 1987 with promoting Long TV Android boxes which allow the bypassing of technological protection measures on copyright broadcast work. On February 16th, a woman director of a mobile accessory company pleaded guilty to a charge of possessing TV media boxes that contains software to illegally stream Astro\u2019s content via the Internet. She was fined RM30,000 under Section 232(2) of the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998, making her the first ISD seller to be charged under this provision.\n\nThe Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) reiterated that it will take stern action against suppliers and sellers who misuse devices and software to illegally access content protected by their copyright work

Court in Luak, Miri on last Friday as blatant abuse of power and inhumane by the police.\n\nAccording to Aidi, a team from the Miri district police station was sent to the premises at around 9.30am after they received a public tip-off that the stalls there were serving dine-in breakfast to customers.\n\n\u201cAt the premises, the team witnessed that one of the stall operator was in the midst of preparing dine-in dishes for her customers,\u201d said Aidi.\n\nThe team also reported that upon realising the presence of the police, a few of the customers quickly left the premises and a worker

Could it be that PBS, just like Warisan, had also rejected Kitingan\u2019s overtures to officially join PN?\u201d he said in a statement today.\n\nKitingan, who heads STAR, a PN component party, had earlier today said he was open to the idea of opposition party Warisan joining the ruling coalition.\n\nThe Keningau MP said STAR was open to the idea and believed everybody should be invited into PN, including Warisan.\n\n\u201cThey have assemblymen who want to serve their constituencies.

The support we give is contingent upon ensuring the Malaysia Agreement 1963 is wholly implemented.\n\n\u201cThis could be the reason why Ongkili was given the task to helm the Sabah and Sarawak affairs ministry in the Prime Minister\u2019s Department,\u201d he said.\n\nSiambun also said Warisan did not wish to be associated with PAS that had rejected a bill to amend Article 1(2) of the Federal Constitution.\n\nThe bill was intended to reinstate Sabah and Sarawak to their original status prior to a 1976 constitutional amendment.\n\nHe said Kitingan, whose STAR party is a formal member of PN, also worked closely with PAS, which had outrightly rejected the bill initiated by the late Liew Vui Keong, the former de facto law minister.\n\nHe said Kitingan should clarify why he is willing to work with PAS which has a nominated assemblyman in the Sabah state assembly now.\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["open", "laughs", "party", "work", "warisan", "state", "pbs", "pn", "join", "invitation", "kitingan", "rejected", "jeffreys"], "summary": "KOTA KINABALU: State opposition party Warisan has declined an invitation by Perikatan Nasional deputy chairman Jeffrey Kitingan to join the ruling coalition, saying the invite was \u201chumorous\u201d.\nCould it be that PBS, just like Warisan, had also rejected Kitingan\u2019s overtures to officially join PN?\u201d he said in a statement today.\nKitingan, who heads STAR, a PN component party, had earlier today said he was open to the idea of opposition party Warisan joining the ruling coalition.\nThe Keningau MP said STAR was open to the idea and believed everybody should be invited into PN, including Warisan.\nAlthough Warisan has rejected Kitingan\u2019s offer, the party has not, however, addressed the invitation initially made by PBS president Maximus Ongkili to join PN.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-05-21 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "AirAsia\u2019s digital businesses to become Asean\u2019s leading super app", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWFsYXlzaWFucmVzZXJ2ZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNS8yOC9haXJhc2lhcy1kaWdpdGFsLWJ1c2luZXNzZXMtdG8tYmVjb21lLWFzZWFucy1sZWFkaW5nLXN1cGVyLWFwcC_SAW5odHRwczovL3RoZW1hbGF5c2lhbnJlc2VydmUuY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvMjgvYWlyYXNpYXMtZGlnaXRhbC1idXNpbmVzc2VzLXRvLWJlY29tZS1hc2VhbnMtbGVhZGluZy1zdXBlci1hcHAvYW1wLw?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://themalaysianreserve.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/AIRASIA-APP.jpg", "text": "By AZALEA AZUAR / Pic credit: airasia.com\n\nAirAsia Group Bhd\u2019s non-airline digital businesses is on the right track to becoming Asean\u2019s digital travel and lifestyle platform as it meets strong consumer demands.\n\nIts super app is now considered one of the region\u2019s top three online travel agencies (OTA) while AirAsia\u2019s e-wallet BigPay is set to become the first virtual bank and its delivery service Teleport is strengthening.\n\nDuring the group\u2019s first quarter of 2021 (1Q21) financial performance announcement on May 27, AirAsia super app posted a 45% year-on-year (YoY) increase in its revenue to RM10 million supported by solid growth of products and services available on the platform.\n\nTeleport\u2019s revenue has also tripled compared to its 1Q20 performance.\n\nAccording to AirAsia Group CEO Tan Sri Tony Fernandes, just as they revolutionised air travel 20 years ago with their low-cost carrier, AirAsia is now disrupting and democratising the lifestyle industry again through the development of their super app with over 17 travel and products leveraging off one another.\n\n\u201cIn just over a year we are now one of the top three leading online travel agencies (OTAs) in Asean based on website traffic, with over 100 million average page views monthly on airasia.com.\n\n\u201cIn the future, when travel resumes in our key markets, we can guarantee best value prices for our flight and hotel packages because we own our own airline,\u201d he explained in a press release today.\n\nExpansion of its popular products and services to its Asean markets for its super app is in AirAsia\u2019s pipeline.\n\n\u201cWe are working on expanding our health services in Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines, while offering SNAP hotel and accommodation deals in Vietnam and Singapore in the near future,\u201d said Fernandes.\n\nHe also said that Teleport not only provides the usual deliveries but has now been delivering vaccines all over Malaysia and the Asean region.

tech training courses to equip not only our own employees, but also SMEs and members of the public, with skills to bridge the technology gap in Malaysia and beyond in this ever changing digital world,\u201d he said.\n\nApart from AirAsia\u2019s digital services, its other non-airline businesses such as AirAsia Food, AirAsia Fresh, AirAsia Shop and its Santan franchise restaurants are also penetrating into new markets.\n\n\u201cAs we continue to expand our digital footprint in Malaysia and other Asean countries, our contribution in the region will only increase and become more significant from here onwards.\n\n\u201cWe saw the crisis as an opportunity to use the downtime in flying caused by the pandemic to leverage the strength of our database of over 60 million customers and to focus on developing new non airline revenue streams in the key areas of e-commerce, fintech and logistics,\u201d Fernandes commented.\n\nAirAsia has more innovations to roll out such as the ride-hailing \u201cAirAsia Ride\u201d, which will be launched in the coming months, as well as the potential of drone delivery.\n\nThe group is also planning for electric or hydronic aeroplanes to meet consumer\u2019s sustainability needs.\n\n\u201cIn the airline business, Asia Digital Engineering (ADE) is set to become one of the region\u2019s best value aircraft maintenance and overhaul providers for both short term line maintenance and longer-term base maintenance, a space previously dominated by Singapore-based maintenance and overhaul companies (MROs).\n\n\u201cI firmly believe ADE will become the leading aircraft maintenance/overhaul company in the region in the near future with significant potential growth opportunities in Asean and beyond with service excellence and the lowest cost base,\u201d he said.\n\nAirAsia is also working to launch more contactless technologies to make flying a seamless and hygienic experience when it resumes.\n\nThis includes a digital passport called Scan2Fly where passengers can upload required medical documentation and have it verified in real time online, before heading to the airport.\n\nThe group would also be introducing FACES, its biometric facial recognition technology at Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2 (KLIA 2) and it will be rolled out across all key destinations.\n\n\u201cThere is a silver lining to every crisis and the best thing to come out of this pandemic is our recovery as a stronger, more resilient travel and lifestyle platform \u2013 not solely reliant on airfares alone anymore,\u201d said Fernandes.\n\nThe \u201cnew look\u201d AirAsia would be embarking on an exciting new phase of growth, with the right focus and foundations to better meet the needs of the digital revolution.\n\nFernandes stressed that they would remain true to their promise of delivering high quality service serving the underserved by making it affordable to fly, stay, shop, eat and upskill.\n\n\u201cLooking out for the everyday people is what we do best and we aim to continue to support them, not only in the major cities, but also in the smaller cities we serve, where many people are struggling the most and access to products and services are more limited.\u201d", "keyword": ["asean", "maintenance", "aseans", "travel", "services", "super", "app", "airasias", "airasia",

open and detailed revelation of an intrusion by China\u2019s air force has raised many questions that the government needs to answer, says an expert in defence and diplomacy matters.\n\n\u201cThe biggest question is how the government, in particular Wisma Putra, is going to resolve it?\u201d asked the expert, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nThe expert said, however, that the RMAF\u2019s \u201cextremely rare\u201d move to reveal details of the incident which saw its fighter jets being scrambled to intercept 16 People\u2019s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) planes in Malaysia\u2019s maritime zone (ZMM), provided a \u201cgolden opportunity\u201d for the country.\n\nThe source said while the possibility that the PLAAF was carrying out surveillance in the area could not be ruled out, the Chinese could also have been \u201ctesting the waters\u201d over Malaysia\u2019s air defence systems and its reaction.\n\nThe \u201cbreach of Malaysian airspace and sovereignty\u201d \u2013 as foreign affairs minister Hishammuddin Hussein termed it \u2013 by the Chinese aircraft is the latest in a series of actions by China in the disputed South China Sea that has its neighbours worried.\n\nFor years, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei, Taiwan and Vietnam have been contesting China\u2019s claim to almost all of the South China Sea. These countries have often protested against China over what they claimed were intrusions into their territories.\n\nIn recent years, the dispute over the sea has seen a rise in tensions not only between China and these nations but also between China and the US. As recent as May 20, China and the US exchanged strong words over US naval activity in the region.\n\nThe expert asked what the rules of engagement would have been had the Chinese planes not turned back when the RMAF scrambled its jets.\n\n\u201cTypically, when an air force is confronted with such a situation, they would fire a warning shot or resort to aggressive manoeuvres to \u2018force\u2019 the foreign planes to turn back. Were our Hawks armed for engagement? How many Hawks were deployed?\n\n\u201cMy question is why did we scramble our Hawk 208 fighters? Those are advanced trainer jets, light fighter jets. They do not have the same interception capabilities of our Sukhoi Su-30MKM or F/A-18 Hornets.\n\n\u201cAre they airworthy? Or were the Hawks deployed because they are closest to that part of the South China Sea? If so, why are we not stationing more advanced fighters closer to the region?\u201d\n\nHe commended Hishammuddin for saying Wisma Putra would summon the Chinese ambassador to explain the incident.\n\nThe Chinese, the expert said, had already said the flight by the 16 planes was routine training and that it had not entered any other country\u2019s territorial air space under international law.\n\n\u201cEssentially, the Chinese are saying they have done nothing wrong. But Wisma Putra wants an explanation on the breach of Malaysian airspace and sovereignty.\n\n\u201cSo who is telling the truth? And what happens next? Will China apologise? I doubt they will, given their stance on the South China Sea.\u201d\n\nThe expert said if Wisma Putra was not satisfied with China\u2019s explanation and if the country refused to apologise, Malaysia should take the \u201cbold\u201d step of expelling the Chinese ambassador and recalling the Malaysian ambassador in China.\n\n\u201cIn diplomatic lexicon, expelling an ambassador is a very serious statement. I think if we do not do so, we (Malaysia) run the risk of looking weak.\u201d\n\nStill, the expert said, the incident provided Malaysia with the \u201cgolden opportunity\u201d to analyse and address defence issues, including the placement of frontline fighter jets and pattern of violations by foreign forces, particularly in the hotly disputed South China Sea.\n\nMeanwhile, defence analyst Lam Choong Wah said Asean and China were currently negotiating a code of conduct (CoC) for the South China Sea and that these negotiations needed to be sped up to regulate the behaviour of military operations in the region.\n\n\u201cMalaysia should utilise all available diplomatic channels to handle the issue to preserve national interests,\u201d Lam said.\n\n\u201cBeing firm or soft is not the crux of the problem. The core issue is there is no CoC in place to regulate military behavior in disputed areas, and until there is a CoC, military or maritime enforcement standoffs will take place from time to time.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "keyword": ["expert", "force", "wisma", "planes", "south", "malaysian", "chinese", "jets", "chinas", "intrusion", "putrajaya", "resolve", "sea", "putra"], "summary": "\u201cThe biggest question is how the government, in particular Wisma Putra, is going to resolve it?\u201d asked the expert, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.\nFor years, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei, Taiwan and Vietnam have been contesting China\u2019s claim to almost all of the South China Sea.\nThe expert asked what the rules of engagement would have been had the Chinese planes not turned back when the RMAF scrambled its jets.\n\u201cTypically, when an air force is confronted with such a situation, they would fire a warning shot or resort to aggressive manoeuvres to \u2018force\u2019 the foreign planes to turn back.\nBut Wisma Putra wants an explanation on the breach of Malaysian airspace and sovereignty.", "news": "Free Malaysia Today", "date": "2021-06-03 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "Take more from KWAN to help M40, B40 groups, says Najib", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wNi8wMi90YWtlLW1vcmUtZnJvbS1rd2FuLXRvLWhlbHAtbTQwLWI0MC1ncm91cHMtc2F5cy1uYWppYi_SAQA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": ["Fmt Reporters"], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/02-PANIC-BUYING-MC0-3.0.jpg", "text": "PETALING JAYA: Former prime minister Najib Razak has urged the government to take another RM4.2 billion from the National Trust Fund (KWAN) to assist the (bottom 40) B40 and (middle 40) M40 groups during the total lockdown.\n\nIn a Facebook post, he assured that Barisan Nasional would replenish the funds in the future.\n\nNajib also questioned if the current allocation of RM100 each for single Malaysians and RM500 for each B40 household with at least three children was sufficient.\n\n\u201cOn top of that, this assistance comes after they have faced MCO 2.0 and MCO 3.0/3.1 for five months, and now the total lockdown,\u201d he said.\n\nNajib noted that the payments would only come in by the end of June, while the additional RM500 for the Prihatin Special Grant (GKP) recipients was due in July.\n\nHe added that GKP recipients should also be eligible for Bantuan Prihatin Rakyat, as they had the additional burden of bearing the losses faced by their businesses.\n\nNajib said the Perikatan Nasional administration could dip into KWAN again if it wished to avoid borrowing more money, since it had already borrowed over RM100 billion for BPR aid within the first five months of the year.\n\nWith the additional funds from KWAN, Najib said, more could be handed out under the Bantuan Prihatin aid scheme.\n\n\u201cThe RM300 to RM500 will become RM900 to RM1,500 for B40 families.

It\u2019s sad at first, but whatever happened, happened and it\u2019s best to move on and be strong,\u201d said the 33-year-old content creator from Selangor, when we spoke on Sunday (30 May).\n\nFahmi had been confirmed positive with Covid-19 after getting tested at the Covid Assessment Centre (CAC) in Stadium Melawati, Shah Alam on 21 May. That same day, he was sent straight to the PKRC to undergo more than a week of mandatory quarantine.\n\n\u201cI have three days to go.

First came the sore throat, fever the day after, then I started to lose my sense of smell and taste, then I started to feel heavy breathing and panting. But nothing serious. That\u2019s why they sent me to MAEPS because here they have the equipment to scan my lungs.\n\nFahmi also said that the medical staff stationed at the PKRC had been very reliable and responsive to his needs and everyone else who\u2019s there.\n\nQuarantine life\n\nWith thousands of other Covid-19 patients confined together at the \u2018DG Hall\u2019 in MAEPS, Fahmi noted his shock when first arriving at the PKRC and said that quarantine life took some getting used to.\n\n\u201cI was of course surprised by the insane number of people here, to the point that there are not enough beds. People have to sleep on mattresses on the floor,\u201d he said, adding that without any appropriate shower facility there, patients also have to contend with long bathroom lines and having to bathe on the toilet.\n\nHowever, despite the minor discomforts, Fahmi said everything at the PKRC had been satisfactory and personally relates life in quarantine to what people might find in boarding schools.\n\n\u201cFood is served three times a day. Breakfast is at 8 am, lunch at 12 noon and dinner at 6 pm. I wake up in the morning to queue for breakfast, queue for showers, and once I\u2019m done I just hang out with the friends I\u2019ve made.\u201d Fahmi gushed, revealing that there really isn\u2019t much to do in quarantine besides interacting with other patients who are there.\n\nIn good company\n\nFahmi also shared how the companionship he made in quarantine helped ease the time spent away from his loved ones.\n\nTogether, he and his newly-found friend shared meals and feels, took leisurely walks, played video games and even prayed together, shoulder to shoulder.\n\nLife in quarantine.\n\n(Credit: Fahmi Esmail)\n\nPeople here are nice, they\u2019re happy and are very friendly to each other. We have bunk-bed mates and neighbours that we share food and snacks that we brought from home.\n\nFahmi also emphasised the importance of making connections and keeping in touch with people in order to power through the coronavirus.\n\nThey\u2019re just normal people, someone that we can talk to, share what we do and laugh with. The key to surviving here is to just make friends to keep yourself sane.\n\nWith the time spent living with a deadly disease and after having been in the Covid-19 isolation camp, Fahmi said that the best way to overcome it all is with positive thinking and not giving up.\n\nI was scared, anything could happen and I was afraid I wasn\u2019t going to come back. But eventually, I try to show people that I am actually okay here and I\u2019m trying to change the perception people have of quarantine at MAEPS.\n\nWith Covid-19 outbreaks continuing nationwide, Fahmi has this to say to the people \u201con the outside\u201d who haven\u2019t yet experienced the challenges of living with Covid-19.\n\nI will say that it\u2019s not a joke and not something that can be taken trivially.

Let\u2019s find out.\n\nThe phone looks pretty good on the back too, so when you\u2019re taking pictures of other people at least they\u2019ll be looking towards you. (Credit: TRP)\n\nA phone catered to selfie enthusiasts\n\nAs advertised by the company, the V21\u2019s main selling point has to be its selfie camera with tonnes of options for you to play with such as adjusting brightness all the way, to toning your cheeks.\n\nAnd apparently, having nifty software tricks is not enough for the Chinese manufacturer as the phone is also fitted with \u2013 wait for it \u2013 two built-in flashlights which the company calls Dual Selfie Spotlight located on the front of the phone.\n\nYou know, just in case you\u2019re in a really, really, dark room and thought that this might be the best time to take a selfie.\n\nCredit: TRP\n\nThe V21 can even guide you on how to take a good selfie \u2013 complete with outlines showing you how to pose and take the shot.\n\nThe back camera is pretty good too if you\u2019re under good sunlight and it has three different lenses for you to choose from.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good in the hand and it\u2019s pretty too\n\nAlthough this phone has a screen size of 6.44 inches, the phone actually feels good in the hand and isn\u2019t super huge thanks to a design that stretches the panel out to the edge of the phone.\n\nIf you\u2019re a bit conservative and want your phone to blend in the background, there\u2019s the Dusk Blue colour option, but if you want it to get everyone\u2019s attention including your own, there\u2019s also Sunset Dazzle which is a real looker.\n\nThe colours on the body of the phone shift when you look at it from different angles which might entice some folks who want their phone to have a slightly funkier colour palette rather than having it just plain old black or white.\n\nCredit: TRP\n\nAll day phone\n\nThe Vivo V21 has quite a slim profile but don\u2019t think that it\u2019s not beefed up in the battery department because the phone can last you a full day even if you\u2019re consuming a lot of content.\n\nThere\u2019s also the option of fast charging if you manage to drain that big battery and they\u2019re not messing about. It\u2019s actually possible to get this thing from 0 to roughly above 50% within half an hour.\n\nCredit: TRP\n\nNot really a gaming phone\n\nThe phone might tick many boxes but gaming is not one of them.\n\nYes, you can play graphic intensive games like COD Mobile or PUBG Mobile, but I noticed that the V21 doesn\u2019t allow you to max out the settings, which might be a dealbreaker for some but if you\u2019re playing casual games, it will work just fine.\n\nShould you get the V21?\n\nIt\u2019s a great phone if you\u2019re someone who likes to take a lot of selfies as this where the phone truly shines. Literally.\n\nThere are not many phones that can say that they have one, let alone two flashes for the front camera and the amount of options is great for those who want to tweak their selfies.\n\nApart from the front camera, the V21 is also capable in other areas such as having a great screen for watching stuff like YouTube or Netflix, a pretty design, and also a large battery with the option of fast charging that borders on ridiculous.\n\nThe Vivo V21 is an affordable package and that not only looks good, but it feels good to use too.\n\nCredit: TRP\n\nShare your thoughts with us via TRP\u2019s Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.", "keyword": ["really", "youre", "camera", "phone", "good", "v21", "pretty", "taking", "having", "selfies", "vivo", "selfie", "review", "option"], "summary": "Vivo recently came out with the V21, a phone that takes aim at those who like to take a lot of selfies.\nBut, is a selfie camera really enough to entice you to get this phone?\nThe phone looks pretty good on the back too, so when you\u2019re taking pictures of other people at least they\u2019ll be looking towards you.\nYou know, just in case you\u2019re in a really, really, dark room and thought that this might be the best time to take a selfie.\nIt\u2019s a great phone if you\u2019re someone who likes to take a lot of selfies as this where the phone truly shines.", "news": "The Rakyat Post", "date": "2021-06-02 00:00:00", "language": "ENGLISH"}, {"title": "We need to prepare for the worst, says health DG", "url": "https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYWxheXNpYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS9uYXRpb24vMjAyMS8wNS8yNS93ZS1uZWVkLXRvLXByZXBhcmUtZm9yLXRoZS13b3JzdC1zYXlzLWhlYWx0aC1kZy_SAQA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen", "authors": [], "top-image": "https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/noor-hisham-abdullah-fmt-080521-2.jpg", "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: Health director-general Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah urged the public to prepare for the worst in facing the Covid-19 wave following an exponential trend indicated by the Covid-19 graph in this country.\n\n\u201cThe rise in cases started from April 1 and could trigger a vertical surge.
